Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you for my first Micron quarterly earnings call and I'm particularly fortunate to be joining at a time when we are able to report record revenues and non-GAAP EPS. These results reflect healthy industry fundamentals, the strength of Micron's diversified technology and product portfolio and our broad customer reach.","Micron also continues to make progress in improving its technology and product competitiveness. The current industry dynamic and the growing strategic importance of Micron's technologies and capabilities make this an exciting time to join the company. The unprecedented amount of data being created, stored and processed presents tremendous opportunities for Micron.","Applications like autonomous driving, machine learning and big data analytics all promise to make an enormous impact on our lives. Memory and flash storage are the critical and increasingly strategic elements in every one of these applications.","Market-leading companies from a broad array of industries who provide data center services, automotive applications and mobile solutions, just to name a few, are eager to partner with innovative companies like Micron that can provide leading-edge technology and systems solutions.","Micron is uniquely positioned with the right technologies and capabilities to take a leadership position, and I'm delighted to have the opportunity to help the company maximize this potential.","I will now share some details from each of our business units, followed by technology and operational highlights for the quarter. Finally, I'll share our perspective on current industry supply and demand dynamics.","We had record revenues in all business units this quarter, nearly doubling our company level year-over-year revenue performance. In the Compute and Networking Business Unit, all segments posted significant gains from year ago levels.","Revenue from cloud customers was more than four times higher year-over-year. And we saw increased enterprise demand as analytics workloads are driving more use of in-memory databases and higher server memory content.","We continue to build upon our strong position in graphics and high performance memory technology, with shipments of our 12 gigabits per second GDDR5X, the industry's fastest discrete DRAM, which we successfully ramped to high volume during the quarter. Most CNBU revenue came from 20-nanometer DRAM products, and we also recognized initial revenue on our next generation 1X DDR4 products.","Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to effectively serve both our traditional OEM customer base, as well as evolving opportunities around tailored solutions for large data center customers.","Our Mobile Business Unit revenue increased slightly quarter-over-quarter with significant margin expansion, driven by lower costs associated with the continued shift to 20-nanometer LPD RAM and a favorable pricing environment. We expect increased demand ahead of anticipated flagship smartphone introductions planned for the fall.","Requirements for multi-camera systems, augmented reality applications and high-resolution displays now dictate 4 and 6-gigabyte LPDRAM densities for a great user experience. This demand aligns well with our 20-nanometer and 1X offerings where we plan to introduce nearly 20 new 1X package-on-package variation in the next 12 months.","We are focused on developing and diversifying our MCP and discrete NAND device offerings, which will position us to well to address the full range of smartphones, from basic entry level smartphones to content rich high-end devices.","Many mobile OEM customers prefer MCPs in their design implementation to address their memory and storage requirements, as MCPs provide a single source for DRAM memory and NAND storage, simplifying system design, validation and supply chain considerations.","We continue to sample our 32-layer MLC and TLC 3D NAND MCP, discrete UFS and e.MMC devices to both chipset partners and handset OEMs.","Revenue shipments of these products will begin later in the second half of this calendar year following completion of qualifications by customers.","Our Embedded Business Unit recorded a 44% increase in revenue year-over-year, driven by strong demand growth across all segments and a better pricing environment. We achieved record quarterly revenue for each of the automotive, consumer and connected home and industrial segments. We saw continued strength in automotive, DRAM and e.MMC NAND with the infotainment and instrument cluster applications driving this record level.","We continue to maintain our strong market share leadership position in automotive, enabled by our focus on a high quality and deep customer relationships and support. Industrial and consumer connected home revenues were led by increased shipments into rapidly growing applications, such as voice-activated home assistance and set-top boxes.","We continue to transition our non-automotive DRAM portfolio onto 20-nanometer designs. Our Storage Business Unit delivered record revenues as sales of our SSD products grew 33% quarter-over-quarter. Sales to cloud and enterprise SSD customers grew appreciably on a combined basis and exceeded revenue from client customers for the first time.","The most significant growth came from our cloud customers, where revenue doubled quarter-over-quarter. Our SSD sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our SATA SSD solutions using our 32-layer TLC 3D NAND.","During the quarter, we had first revenue shipments of our 8-terabyte SSD enterprise class SSD, which is an industry first. Several new OEM and hyperscale customer qualifications are underway for our SATA drives, and in calendar year 2018, we plan to introduce NVMe PCIe offerings using our 64-layer TLC 3D NAND.","On the manufacturing operations front, we continue to make good progress toward achieving meaningful output by the end of our fiscal year on both our 64-layer 3D NAND and our 1X DRAM.","Both of these technologies have already begun revenue shipments and are advancing well in their production yield ramp. We also continue to execute our plans to outfit our assembly operations as part of our DRAM center of excellence in Taiwan.","These DRAM center, in addition to our NAND center of excellence in Singapore, will be essential to our ongoing efforts to optimize costs and improve our flexibility and speed to meet customer needs.","On the technology front, we continue to make solid progress on the development of our third-generation 3D NAND and our next-generation 1y DRAM technologies. Our third-generation 3D NAND will continue to be based on our innovative CMOS-under-the-array architecture.","This architecture, pioneered by Micron, provides the benefits of smaller die size and lower cost. We expect our 1y DRAM to further improve our competitive position in the industry.","Looking at the industry broadly, Micron continues to see a healthy supply and demand environment that creates opportunities across both memory and storage markets.","For calendar 2017, we expect DRAM industry bit supply growth of between 15% and 20%, slightly below our view of demand growth. For NAND, we expect 2017 industry supply growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, constraining what would otherwise be higher demand.","We expect healthy industry demand to persist into 2018, supported by continued strong growth in both DRAM and NAND demand, reflecting broader trends in the data center and mobile markets, as well as increased adoption of SSDs across enterprise, cloud and client PCs.","Finally, after my first two months at Micron, I would like to share some of my priorities. Our execution and competitiveness are my primary focus, particularly accelerating the ramp of new technologies into volume production and introducing new products quickly, both of which are essential to delivering innovative solutions at lower cost and strengthening Micron's business fundamentals.","Micron has a tremendous portfolio of technologies and core capabilities. Our goal is to leverage these to provide high-value products and solutions that improve our revenue mix. We will target high growth opportunities and seek out partnerships with leading companies in the ecosystem to position Micron for long-term success.","We are off to a good start. Our execution and the current business climate are creating more flexibility, which we are leveraging to solidify our foundation through technology, product and manufacturing investments, while also strengthening our balance sheet. I believe that through focus and solid execution, Micron can capitalize on the world's increasing reliance on memory and storage solutions.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ernie, who will walk through the specifics of our financial performance this quarter.","Ernest Maddock","Thank you, Sanjay. We had a strong quarter with record revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow, driven by the continued positive industry environment, additional bit growth from our current technologies and progress on deploying our next-generation technologies into manufacturing.","I will provide an overview of the fiscal Q3 results by technology and business unit, followed by comments on our overall corporate financial performance and guidance for F 'Q4.","DRAM represented 64% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the mid 20% range. PC was in the low 20% range, down from the prior quarter. Server represented approximately 30%, up from 25% the prior quarter, and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, automotive and other embedded technologies, was in the mid 20% range.","Our trade NAND revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which consists primarily of component sales to partners and customers, was approximately 40%. Mobile, which includes managed NAND discrete solutions and the majority of our MCPs, was in the mid-teens percent range. SSDs were in the mid 20% range, up slightly from last quarter, and automotive, industrial and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range.","Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute & Networking Business Unit reported fiscal Q3 revenue of $2.4 billion, up 25% sequentially due to increased bit shipments, ongoing success in penetrating growing segments like enterprise, graphics and high-performance memory and cloud and a stronger pricing environment.","Non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion or 51% of revenue, up from 38% to prior quarter. 20-nanometer products were greater than half of CNBU revenue and were shipped primarily in the enterprise, cloud and client segments.","Revenue growth in the enterprise segment was driven by the continued expansion of DRAM content per server. And in the cloud space, we experienced good sequential bit growth. Both segments also benefited from the current pricing environment. We saw ongoing growth of our 20-nanometer DDR4 products with particular strength coming from the latest industry server platforms.","In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer, 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 products. We also continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio. This strength was primarily evident in data center networking equipment.","Double-digit client revenue growth was driven by a continued firm pricing environment and product mix optimization, resulting in modestly declining bit shipments. Our 1X nanometer revenue was predominantly in this segment.","Graphics also saw double-digit revenue growth, driven by strength in the game console market, as well as new PC graphics card product launches, including the G5X-based Titan Xp from NVIDIA.","The Mobile Business Unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.1 billion, up 4% sequentially, driven primarily by a stronger pricing environment and our non-GAAP operating income was $304 million or 27% of revenue, up from 16% to prior quarter.","The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $700 million, up 19% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million or 37% of revenue, up from 33% the prior quarter.","The results were driven by strong bit demand and increased average selling prices of DRAM, combined with record shipments of SLC and MLC NAND in the consumer and connected home segments and record shipments of DRAM and eMMC NAND into the industrial and automotive segments respectively.","The Storage Business Unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.3 billion, up 26% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $276 million or 21% of revenue, up from 7% the prior quarter. The results were primarily driven by strong unit growth of SSDs and a stronger pricing environment.","Moving to overall company results. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $5.6 billion, up 20% sequentially and driven by primarily stronger DRAM ASPs and higher NAND bit volumes.","On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 92%, primarily due to a stronger DRAM pricing environment, increased bit volumes in both DRAM and NAND and our focus on higher value-add solutions to improve our product mix.","Examples of this improved mix includes SSDs where year-on-year revenue tripled, while in DRAM bits embedded in high-value solution for enterprise, cloud and graphics customers, together grew at a rate twice our overall DRAM bit output for the same period.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 48%, up from 38.5% in the prior quarter, driven by increased DRAM ASPs and cost per bit reductions in both DRAM and NAND.","On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 30 percentage points, driven by a stronger DRAM pricing environment, a better product mix and lower cost per bit in both DRAM and NAND. Non-GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $1.62 per share.","Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 20% compared to the prior quarter as a result of a 5% increase in bit shipments and a 14% increase in ASPs.","DRAM non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter increased 10 percentage points sequentially to 54%, driven by a 6% cost per bit reduction and better product mix. As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 DRAM bit output would be about 10% higher than first half fiscal year 2017.","As we look forward into fiscal 2018, the timing of the 1x technology transition is expected to result in our bit growth at or slightly below industry growth rates over the same period. We consider this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2 year bit growth CAGR earlier this year.","Trade NAND revenue increased 21% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting a 17% increase in bit shipments and a 3% increase in ASPs. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41%, up 10 percentage points, driven by a 12% cost per bit reduction and better product mix.","As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 bit growth would be about 30% above first half fiscal year 2017. Based on the timing of technology transitions, we foresee relatively muted bit growth in the first half of fiscal 2018 follow by stronger growth in the second half. Consistent with DRAM, we considered this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2 year bit growth CAGRs earlier in the year.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $600 million, down $12 million from the prior year quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in fiscal Q3 compared to $389 million in the year ago period.","During the quarter, we deployed $1.3 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions and free cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion as we retired approximately $1 billion of debt via a tender offer for certain of our high-yield notes. We currently expect fiscal year 2017 free cash flow of approximately $3 billion and continue to prioritize the deployment of our cash flow toward advancing our production technology capabilities and reducing our debt.","For fiscal year 2017, we are trending to the upper end of our indicated net CapEx range of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. We will provide a fiscal year 2018 CapEx perspective later this year.","We ended the third quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $4.9 billion. Our guidance for fiscal Q4 is informed by our view of sustained, healthy supply and demand dynamics, our ongoing work around cost reduction and the improvement of our product mix.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following, revenue in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion, gross margin in the range of 47% to 51%, operating expenses between $575 million and $625 million, and operating income ranging between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. EPS will range between $1.73 and $1.87 per share, based on 1,179 billion [ph] diluted shares.","At our Analyst Day in February, we outlined how our production technology execution and the results in bit growth and cost reductions have enabled us to significantly strengthen our cash flow and financial performance in any market conditions.","We've been reporting our incremental progress each quarter. However, I wanted to share the tremendous progress we've made over the 12-month period ending in fiscal Q3.","During that time, our bit output has been above industry average for both DRAM and trade NAND and our cost per bit has declined approximately 25% and 30% in those technologies respectively.","In addition, we continue to improve our competitiveness by successfully delivering solutions to deliver higher value-add opportunities. Our ability to deliver these results has enhanced our energy and excitement to make further progress, and we look forward to sharing that with you.","With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Ernie. Last week we announced that Sumit Sadana joined Micron as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, a role that unites our four business units and our strategy and business development team into a single organization. This structure will better equip us to align our product strategies to market trends and customer demands. ","Sumit brings nearly three decades of industry experience. He is a proven leader in driving strategy and building businesses with the focus on high-value profitable growth. Sumit has a successful track record at multiple large technology companies, and his perspective and expertise make him an ideal fit for Micron.","Earlier this week, we also announced that Jeff VerHeul joined Micron as Senior Vice President of Non-Volatile Engineering. Jeff has extensive experience in leading the development of advanced semiconductor products, including flash system-level solutions.","I look forward to Jeff's contributions in advancing Micron's roadmap of flash memory technology and value-added products. We welcome both Sumit and Jeff to Micron.","Finally, I would like to extend gratitude to my predecessor, Mark Durcan. His dedication and leadership has positioned Micron well for this next chapter of success. As I have toured Micron\u2019s facilities and met with leaders and teams throughout the company and have begun to engage with some of our customers.","I have been impressed by the strength of our technologies, scale, customer reach and innovative hard working spirit of our global team. My experience since joining Micron has reinforced what I have known for a long time. This company has tremendous potential and can become one of the world's most successful semiconductor companies. I'm proud to be part of this iconic company.","We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. Sanjay, welcome to the team. First question is for you. At the time that SanDisk was acquired by Western Digital, SanDisk had a number two position in the global SSD markets, strong number three position in enterprise SSD, I think you were growing that business about 15% to 20% year-over-year.","If I look at the most recent market share stats, you know, Micron is sitting at about a number 5 market share position in both total SSD and enterprise SSD market share. So in what areas does the Micron team really have to focus on in order to drive leadership position in SSD, especially enterprise, is it systems capability, firmware, controller, OEM and cloud relationships and more importantly, what are you going to do to start to enable this?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Well, Micron team actually has over already been, as we said in our remarks, working on driving high-value solutions mix to greater levels in its portfolio. The company has made strong progress over a couple of quarters in client SSDs, as well as enterprise and cloud SSDs.","And if you look at some of the market share numbers you will see that the market share over last couple of quarters has increased meaningfully. The market shares in enterprise, cloud stands at sub-10% levels and in client markets for SSDs, the market share is in high single digits at this point.","So, all this definitely points to a much greater opportunity for the company in the times ahead. And key things that we had to focus on, this is absolutely an area of my priority here, is to increase the mix of system-level solutions in the NAND portfolio of the company. Things that have been going well, continue to build on them but expand, diversify our capabilities, our product portfolio and deepen our customer engagement.","The thing that's really, really powerful for Micron here is that Micron has strong position in DRAM as well as NAND. And basically on the continent, this is the only company that has these strong capabilities. Therefore, customers are very much engaged with us in helping us drive the strength in the system level solutions on the NAND side.","In the areas where we have to focus on, to answer your question further are certainly continue to strengthen our controller capabilities, as well as firmware capabilities. Today, some of them \u2013 most of them are based on external controllers and we have a roadmap of both, external and internal controllers going ahead. So, these will be an important area of focus for the company going forward.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thank you. And then, Ernie, for you on the gross margin front, you know, solid job over the team - by the team over the past few quarters. Going forward, you're looking for about another 100 basis points of improvements. The demand environment is shaping up to be stronger second half over first half. Supply outlook still seems pretty disciplined, and the team is doing a great job on driving the cost curves.","So it seems like your gross margin expansion should be greater than the implied 100 basis points you're guiding to. Are there any mix-related impacts in Q4 which is holding back the margin profile?","Ernie Maddock","I don't think so. I think it's a function of pattern of our bit growth over the course of this year. So while we will continue to enjoy cost reduction in the final quarter of this fiscal year, it's going to be likely a bit of a slower rate than we've experienced for the first part of the year. And also as we look at the pricing environment, you know, we continue to view supply and demand in a favorable way.","But bear in mind, we've now have had several consecutive quarters of nice quarter-over-quarter step-ups. And it isn't always advisable to bank on continued aggressive quarter-on-quarter pricing increases as you think about the business.","Harlan Sur","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.","Wayne Low","Hello. This is Wayne Low in for Chris Danely. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. Can you talk about any changes you are seeing in the server demand trends, is it possible that we'll see allocation or lead time expansion in this market?","Sanjay Mehrotra","The server demand definitely continues to be strong for DRAM. If you look at the growth for DRAM content combined with the unit server increases, the growth - bit growth rate that we are looking at for the industry is about 40% on a year-over-year basis. So this is really high-value segment of the market.","And certainly as we know, that industry in 2017 is experiencing overall tightness on the DRAM side, driven primarily by the strong growth on markets such as server, as well as other markets like mobile continuing to be very strong, where the average capacities of DRAM content is increasing, you know, given all the features that the phones are implementing, and even markets like automobile where DRAM content continues to increase nicely.","So the demand trends are being driven by multiple markets. Certainly server is the highest growth trend in the marketplace today. And that's all for the DRAM side of the business.","Wayne Low","Okay. Can I ask you just for a little bit more color on what you are seeing on as far as handset demand trends? What has the impact been from the China inventory correction? And also what do you anticipate the impact would be of high-end SKUs of flagship phones being delayed?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So I think when you look at the content of DRAMs in the mobile market, it really continues to increase nicely going in value smartphones from about a little over gigabyte per phone to about doubling by 2018 timeframe, so continued strong growth in terms of average capacity.","And the same trend is certainly happening on the high end phones too, where you are starting to see 4- and 6-gigabyte DRAM content. And certainly on the multi-chip packages also, we are seeing high DRAM content, as well as high-NAND content being driven in the mobile phone market.","So overall when you look at year-over-year trends in 2017, as well as when you look at the trajectory in 2018, mobile does continue to be a strong market. Certainly, there can be periods where there can be some inventory adjustments in certain parts of the market, but important thing to focus on is really the long-term trend.","And that trend, due to all the features that are being implemented, even in the entry-level smartphones and certainly on the high-end smartphones are tending to drive higher average content and demand growth for DRAM, as well as for NAND.","Wayne Low","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is on DRAM ASPs. On the last earnings call the company commented about how some of the contracts that have been in place for a while - haven't caught up with the substantial increase in spot pricing.","And I'm wondering to what extent you expect a similar dynamic to play out as you think about the August quarter?","Ernie Maddock","I think as I have mentioned in my earlier remark, we are still seeing some adjustments upward in certain segments of the market, certainly in terms of both frequency and magnitude. Those were a little less than we've experienced in the prior few quarters, Mark.","Mark Delaney","Okay. That's helpful. And then for follow-up question, the NAND gross margins expanded very significantly and the company did very well on the cost per bit reduction, down 12% quarter-on-quarter. I know, Ernie, you said we shouldn't expect cost reductions to come every quarter at those sorts of rates.","But it seems like the company is on track to exceed the 20% to 25% cost target that have guided for the NAND business for this year. And I just wondered to what extend you think you have the ability to exceed that prior guidance, given how much you've already accomplished or is there maybe other factors like mix that we need to keep in mind for the August quarter on the NAND business on cost?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, I think it's important to remember that, that cost reduction was a 2 year CAGR. And certainly you'd expect with the kind of bit growth that we've experienced in our fiscal \u201817, that you would be at the upper end or above the upper end of that range. And if you go back and look at our fiscal \u201816, we were below.","So it's important to blend those two years together, but the answer would get you to fairly significant cost reductions this year, commensurate with the type of bit growth that we've spoken of.","Mark Delaney","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Can you give us a bit more detail on 3D NAND, the third generation versus the second generation? You've somewhat answered this in terms of the cost. But just looking specifically at third and second generation, how much cost savings do you get, reduction in cost per bit and does third generation have more layers or a narrower line width or both?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So regarding the third generation, we will provide you more details as we get closer to production of that technology, obviously for competitive reasons.","David Wong","Okay, fine. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on the great results. Can you say what's happening with your contract periods? It used to be PC DRAMs were negotiated every two weeks. I'm sure that customers are asking for extensions on those contracts. Can you just say in general what's your average contract time now?","Ernie Maddock","So there hasn't been a significant change during this period of time. Typically as you noted, PC DRAM contracts are the shortest, you know, we would actually say maybe a little longer than 2 weeks, but certainly roughly in the realm of a month or so. And then the other technologies tend to go up from there. But we haven't seen any material change in the duration as a result of the current market environment.","Although, there may be some requests for that, it's typically not something that gets changed very much over the course of the cycle.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay. Great. And maybe just if you can give us your views adding more DRAM wafer capacity, what would stimulate that or what would be your decision to ever add wafer capacity on DRAM?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Our focus in DRAM is to continue to advance our technology and to ramp the new technology nodes into production as rapidly as we can, keeping in mind our customer requirements and there of course qualification of products built using those technologies. And we\u2019re always keeping an eye on overall demand and supply balance and our own demand and supply balance as well. So basically prudent focus on supply growth management.","But the primary focus, the one that provides highest return on investments is around technology transitions and that's where really all our priorities will be.","In terms of any new capacity, I mean we would certainly have to first make sure that we have captured the maximum potential of our technology transition capability in manufacturing. And then we\u2019ll have to certainly see that there is sustained projection of sustained demand growth in the years ahead before we consider adding new capacity.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you. Hi, guys. A question on the PC segment, Ernie, I think you said PC's down. I just want to make sure it's not down in absolute terms. It doesn't look like it, I just want to make sure.","And then if can you comment on what sort of demand trends you are seeing in the PC and also the pricing trends last quarter?","Ernest Maddock","Sure. So Sanjay may team up for this. But relative to the gigs shift or volume shift into the PC segment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we did have a slight decline in unit volume. It wasn't very significant at all, but that was part of our plan to address higher value-added markets. I don't think it was reflective of a decreased demand environment in any way, shape or form.","We don't typically comment on the going forward pricing environment, other than the general statement that we see fairly good balance between supply and demand. And we're going to continue to monitor that segment quite carefully from a bit growth perspective.","I think we're thinking that that segment would somewhere be in the range of plus low to mid-single digits in aggregate for us in fiscal '17 and I think that that addresses the three points you raised but if not, please let us know.","Srini Pajjuri","Yeah. That's great. That's helpful. And then in terms of the cash usage, Ernie, I think in the past, you said it's mostly your top priority is to pay off the debt or at least reduce the debt load, and obviously, a very strong free cash flow here.","And then, given Sanjay's comments about the enterprise SSD focus, et cetera, I\u2019m just focus as to if and where M&A might come in, if I kind of take a longer-term view here? Thank you.","Ernest Maddock","In terms of driving our growth ahead, of course, we have several tools available to us. Our technology and product capabilities, our engagement with customers and our ability on the manufacturing side in terms of implementing the new technologies into production.","We would never rule out any M&A, if and when appropriate, we would absolutely consider it, but it would have to be something that does provide ROI. So we just want to make sure that we focus on our priorities. And our priorities at this point are to strengthen our strategy and product execution and increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio mix, while engaging with customers on defining the future generation architectures.","So again, I don't rule out any M&A, but it of course always has to be considered in the context of what value it brings and what ROI it brings.","Srini Pajjuri","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura Instinet.","Romit Shah","Yeah. Thank you. Ernie, just on OpEx it's been coming in lower than anticipated, I think for a few quarters and in light of kind of your new product strategies and the upcoming fiscal year, can you give us just an advice on how to think about OpEx?","Ernest Maddock","We've mentioned earlier in the year that one of the biggest variables in terms of the quarterly level of OpEx is something we call pre-qual expense. So as we are going through the process of qualifying either new packages or new technologies for customers those carry with them significant expenses.","When we went into this fiscal year, we suggested that they would be more heavily weighted toward the front part of the first year and you've seen that play out here as our operating expenses have flattened out. As we look forward, we're considering OpEx as part of our fiscal year 2018 planning process and we're not quite through that.","So I think we'll be in a position to share a little bit more color on that with you on the next call. But we are, as always, very mindful of operating expenses and operating expense progression. So we're taking a very close look at that.","Romit Shah","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Sanjay, when the announcement was made that you were joining, I think, some of us, at least the initial reaction was that, yeah, there's a lot of potential to improve the mix within NAND.","So sort of seeing consumer at 40% of the business, SSDs kind of in the mid-20s, where do you think you can take the mix of business within NAND and how long would it take for you to get it to where you want?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So at this point, we're not prepared to really lay out mix targets for the future. But I can certainly tell you that indeed there is great opportunity over time to strengthen the mix of the managed NAND solutions, that means SSDs, as well as in the mobile space, things like eMMC, UFS and MCP.","And again, I would like to point out that there is a large part of mobile market, which demands MCP, and Micron is very well-positioned with this mix of DRAM and flash. So we will definitely focus on bringing up solution, more MCP solutions using our eMMC and UFS capabilities in the future.","I would like to point out that these kind of transitions do take a period of time. Micron is, I would say, still in the early days of implementing this transition. Over extended period of time we definitely will be driving the mix. But it really has excessive focus of the entire leadership team here. And with the hire of Jeff VerHeul, we have certainly double down in this area in terms of focusing further on system level solutions for NAND.","Romit Shah","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next\u2026","Sanjay Mehrotra","As you know, I will also just add that in terms of the components side of things, that includes some of the sales that the company makes to Intel, which as you know is our partner in terms of development, so that's part of that component mix that you were talking about as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks for taking my question. Ernie, I just wanted to go back to a prior answer you had. When you look obviously, I feel bad asking, your cash flow obviously has grown hugely in the last couple of quarters. I mean, if you look at this the cash in the next fiscal year, it wasn't that long ago people were asking how you're going to pay for CapEx and now your flush [ph] with cash.","So just kind of curious your thought process, you pulled in a little in terms of transitions, but it\u2019s only $200 million, just kind of you weight those options in terms of faster transitions, capacity adds, buybacks, as well as the debt retirement, which you did this quarter?","Ernest Maddock","Sure. So consistent with one of the earlier answers, we are in the middle of our planning process for fiscal \u201918 and certainly as we look at some of the priorities of the company, they have always been highly centered around continuing to drive our costs down.","So, despite the fact that we have been, to some degree, mindful of in the context of the cash flow of the company in the past, we\u2019re going to continue to do the right thing and be prudent and disciplined in that regard. We have ample opportunity to reduce the debt profile of the company. So I appreciate your thinking we're flush with cash. We're still not as flush as I would like to be. So that's going to continue to be a priority of \u2013 about generating that free cash flow, as well as reducing the debt.","So consistent with our prepared remarks, those are the two things we're focused on. And you will continue to see us be very thoughtful in how we pursue both of those here as we enter our fiscal year 2018.","Blayne Curtis","Excellent. And I just want follow-up on the computing strength in terms of next platform from Intel has more, maybe talk about that as demand driver, and did that contribute, did you see anything in terms of the build ahead of that launch, which is more second half of this calendar year?","Ernest Maddock","We certainly do think that that will, as it gets launched it will be driving greater demand, certainly for bits, yes.","Blayne Curtis","Is that more \u2013 did you see any contribution yet or is it something that would be more next fiscal year?","Ernest Maddock","I would expect it to be increasing over time.","Blayne Curtis","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with MS.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. Just following on the last question, in terms of CapEx trajectory, you've talked about a long-term number that sort of \u2013 it will be centered around 30% of sales, I believe.","And I'm just curious, Sanjay, maybe changing some of the priorities and things like that, is that still the, without getting into the \u201818 plan that's not done yet, is that still the ballpark we should be thinking about long-term?","Ernest Maddock","I think it's important to remember that was a long-term target, and that there are years where we've been below, there are other years where we've been above. And so I don't know that relative to a long-term target that we would be prepared to be making any changes at this point.","But by the same token - and if we do, certainly as we did earlier last year, will share that with you. But at present time that target remains the same. Bear in mind that it is a long-term target.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And I would agree with Ernie that the long-term target here is definitely I think very appropriately placed.","Joe Moore","Okay. Thanks for that. And then the growth that you saw in your compute and networking when you talked about quadrupling year-on-year in cloud, I guess, that number surprise me a little bit. And how much of that do you think is sort of Micron improving penetration versus things like memory content going up, just help us understand how that number's so good year-on-year? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think it's obviously a combination of both that we've been saying for some time, Joe, that this is a priority of the company to really become stronger in segments where we have the opportunity to develop deeper relationships, offer higher value add, more sustained customer relationships and I think we've done a great job at executing on that strategy.","So while there is absolutely benefit from prizing, absolutely, we enjoyed the same benefit that others did. From the average content increase, I think we enjoyed a disproportional benefit by executing on our strategy, addressing these markets in ways that allow us to get deeper penetration.","Joe Moore","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Sanjay, my first question is when you think about sort of the consensus view on long-term NAND demand it's fairly bullish, which makes sense given the SSD story.","But when you think about the long-term view of DRAM demand, I think it's less sanguine. I think the view is sort of PC units start really growing, handset units probably not growing all that much.","I'm just kind of curious though, when you think about these applications like data analytics, AI, maybe level four, level five autonomous driving, is there a bottoms-up argument to have a more bullish long-term view on DRAM demand?","And I\u2019d be kind of curious because the consensus is sort of 15% to 20%, might be the long-term big growth, which would be well below sort of the historic level. I'd love to get your view, and if it's greater than 15% to 20%, is that something that's going to require more than just technology transitions to support?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Certainly, we have, I believe, strong opportunities in technology transition to meet the future growth expectations. As I said in a response to an earlier question as well that we definitely will have to be exploiting that fully before we would ever consider any capacity additions.","And you are certainly right, that the demand drivers certainly are the DI, the machine learning with so much data being generated and all of that data require to be processed fast to provide \u2013 its great experience for consumers, as well as bring great value to businesses to enable and unleash the application.","This is all the AI in the technology space. It's just extremely early days and extremely dynamic and definitely memory and storage will become, I believe, a key enabler for the capabilities that AI technology would be able to enable in multitude of applications, whether it is autonomous driving or it is cloud computing in variety of applications here.","So, yes, I mean, the demand outlook here certainly is very interesting, but again, we just do not want to be getting ahead of ourselves. I think it is important that we stay focused on continuing to drive the business with focus on prudent supply growth here.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. And then Ernie, as my follow-up, I know you don't want give us quarter-by-quarter mix targets. But I'm kind of curious, as you sort of exit the back half of this fiscal year where you're outgrowing industry bits in both NAND in DRAM, and you move into next year where you'll be under growing.","Could you help us just kind of frame, is there enough sort of mix up opportunity during the first half \u201818 where even though you might be losing some bit share, you might not be losing sort of profit share in the industry? How do we think about where you are on that mix optimization curve?","Ernest Maddock","Well, I think as we noted, we are making progress every single quarter with penetrating higher value-added solutions. And we would expect, if we are successful in continuing to execute on that, that we would be in a position to have greater revenue from those segments which may, depending on the pricing environment, to some degree mitigate a little bit the bit growth profile.","But bear in min, John, that we talked about our bit growth in context of an industry that we were estimating. But we also used the words at or slightly below, not materially below. So I do think it's important to keep that in mind.","And on the NAND front, we just simply said we would have a little slower growth in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. I wouldn't expect that we were going to be dramatically different or so underperforming the industry that it would disadvantage the company.","John Pitzer","Helpful. Thanks, Ernie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone.","Jagadish Iyer","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Ernie and Sanjay. First, if you go from 20-nanometer to 18-nanometer in the case of DRAM and as well as 32 to 64 layer in case of 3D NAND, we just want to understand, what kind of cost reduction should we be thinking about and how was the trajectory as we look to calendar \u201818? And then I have a follow up.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So as you look through calendar 2018, we will certainly be continuing to ramp our 1x DRAM technology as well as our 64 layer technology during the course of that timeframe. We are still in early stages. As we said, we'll be achieving meaningful output of both 1x, as well as 64 layers this quarter here. But we continue to be ramping it during the course of next several quarters.","In terms of the bit growth, 20-nanometer provided something like, let's say, 40%, slightly greater than that in terms of bit growth compared to the prior node and gave us a cost reduction of more than 20%. And then we look at 1x compared to 20-nanometer, that's also in that same range, although 1x gives us somewhat greater cost reduction than 20-nanometer node give us over the prior 25-nanometer node.","And when we go from to 32-layer compared to the planer NAND that we had - here we had at Micron, the last edition of planar NAND, 32-layer gave us bit growth in volume die of about 100% or so and gave us a cost reduction of greater than \u2013 in the range of maybe sub-30%.","And going from 32-layer to 64-layer bits gained is also about 100% and cost reduction going from 32-layer to 64 layer is also. At mature yields, comparing mature yields to mature yield and high volume wafer product to high volume product,","32 layer to 64 layer will also give us about a 30% cost reduction.","So a Micron has been really well positioned in NAND with the 32-layer technology, which has given it meaningful cost reduction over our last planar node and 64-layer continues that trend ahead as well.","Ernest Maddock","And Jagadish just add to that, I would refer you back to some of the 2 year cost reduction CAGR we've provided at our Analyst Day, which gives you a view of fiscal \u201817 and \u201818 together. So that might be helpful to you as well as you think about that.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay. That's very helpful. And finally, I just want to understand your thoughts on the DRAM channel inventory level at this point of time? Thank you.","Ernest Maddock","We think that the channel inventories are well within the range that we would considered to be normal. Certainly, they have improved from a quantity point of view over the first part of this year when they were extremely, extremely short. But in aggregate, I think that - we think that channel inventory levels are still within healthy ranges.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And I just want to add a comment to my response before to you, your question was very specific in terms of cost reductions between technology nodes on high-volume products essentially. And that - those numbers should not be confused with year-over-year cost reductions.","Because year-over-year cost reductions on the overall blend of the business are very much a function of the technology mix that is in production. And as I indicated, these technologies will be gradually ramping up for us in production over the course of next several quarters, while the older technologies will still continue to be in production to meet our overall diversified customer requirements for diversified mix of technology and product and solutions.","Jagadish Iyer","Thanks so much for that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.","C.J. Muse","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess first question. Could you share your initial thoughts on what your outlook is for DRAM supply for the industry in calendar '18? And as part of that for 1x, when do you expect to reach a crossover point?","Ernest Maddock","You know C.J., we think the industry for calendar '18 could be slightly higher than the range of growth in calendar '17 which is 15% to 20%. So maybe add a couple of percentage points to either end of the range.","And we haven't shared yet bit crossover for 1x. We've said we have meaningful output by end of fiscal year. We're clearly on track to do that and we'll provide more perspective on that as we more fully describe our 2018 plans.","C.J. Muse","That's helpful. And then I guess a quick follow-up on CapEx, you said you are going to spend towards the higher end of the range, so roughly 300 plus give or take million. Is that more DRAM or NAND, can you share what that spending is and is that translating to more bits or does it relate to rising capital intensity?","Ernest Maddock","So just to make sure we're on the same page, we have given a range this year of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. And we said we were trending toward that $5.2 billion range. So it's just a couple of hundred million dollars.","And I would say that really there is no specific area that I would point you toward. It's just doing what we need to do to make sure we are well set up here as we exit the end of the fiscal year.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark Durcan. Mark?","Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter, followed by a few strategic and industry thoughts. Then I'll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary. And before turning to Q&A, we'll close our prepared comments with Mark Adams covering additional details of our business units and operational performance and market conditions.","Our fourth fiscal quarter was highlighted by the long anticipated closing of the Elpida acquisition. I want to thank all our team members, whether from Micron, Elpida or Rexchip for all their hard work getting us to this point. While we were able to get a good head start on planning and technology development, integration is now in full swing and we hit the ground running with solid combined financial performance in Q4. We expect this execution to continue in Q1 as we take advantage of the strong market conditions along with enhanced scale technology, cost and customer positioning.","Our DRAM business roughly doubled overnight as Elpida and Rexchip delivered scale in the PC segment and a leading mobile product portfolio that dovetails nicely with Micron's strength and other specialty DRAM categories such as networking, server and [AIM]. We were also very happy with the performance of our new Japanese team in the graphics arena and expect significant growth in that segment driven by next generation gaming consoles hitting the market soon.","Mobile DRAM is now in the mid to high 30% range of our DRAM bits with PC in a similar range and server in the mid-teens. While consumer, networking and storage and [AIM] are all in the single-digits as a percentage of bits, they remain higher than that in terms of revenue. In summary, we have a large product portfolio in every critical segment of the DRAM market and we will now turn our focus to optimizing margins and returns.","Turning to the NAND business, we're building a large and solid foundation in SSDs, both through the expansion of our own SSD product lines as well as through strategic customer engagement in the space. Micron branded SSDs and sales of strategic SSD customers now consume in aggregate over 60% of our NAND trade bit. We also have a margin driven retail business and are focusing on a growing set of opportunities to expand the high value embedded -- expand in the high value embedded applications.","The wireless NOR market continues a moderate decline as predicted, but embedded NOR remains very attractive, and we're driving profitable growth there. We recently entered into an agreement to sell our 200 millimeter NOR fab in Israel, and we've started moving NOR production to Singapore and to our 300 millimeter fab in Virginia. This will enable significant cost reductions going forward while still providing ample capacity to service the market.","Comparing our major technology categories for the quarter, trade NAND achieved gross margins in the low 30% range, followed by DRAM in the mid-20s and NOR in the high-single digits. As Ron will describe in more detail, the reported DRAM margins from the newly acquired capacity appears lower initially as both WIPs and finished goods at close were written up to reflect anticipated market prices. This purchase price accounting effect should flow through over the next quarter or so.","We continue to make capital and segmentation decisions to optimize margins and free cash flow over time. Operating cash flow of $717 million [excluded] (ph) our disciplined and measured capital expenditures of $332 million in the quarter. Both these numbers include one month of Elpida financials. The Micron-only fiscal 2013 CapEx of $1.4 billion came in at the low-end of our updated guidance range as we deferred spending into 2014. As a result, our 2014 guidance of $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion is actually somewhat above what we believe the normal run rate for our business should be.","Conditions remained favorable for strong memory industry fundamentals. In NAND, we're projecting industry supply this year up in the low 40% range with next year very similar. The 2014 projection includes about a 10% increase in industry wafer production with our remaining supply growth coming from technology. This supply forecast compares to the five-year NAND demand CAGR of 43%, implying a favorable supply and demand balance. Micron's total NAND supply growth will be below the industry this year and slightly above next year, given our DRAM to NAND conversion in Singapore. Mark Adams will comment on the status and solid execution going on there.","For DRAM, we expect to see declining industry wafers over the next 12 months with a recent fire at one of our competitor\u2019s fabs amplifying this effect. Clearly, the fire is impacting and will continue to impact supply in the market as the fab in total, including potentially unimpacted capacity, represents about 13% of industry DRAM capacity. We are working with our customers to assist them where possible, but we're not currently changing any of our production plans as a result of the fire. Without making any major assumptions for the impact of the fire, we are projecting DRAM industry supply up in the mid-20% range this year and a similar range next year. The current DRAM five-year demand CAGR is in the low 30s implying a favorable long-term market situation there also.","Micron's total DRAM bit production, including Elpida, should be slightly above the industry this year and below the industry next year. This includes the impact of our DRAM to NAND conversion plans. It was a rewarding quarter at Micron, but much remains to be done. While the Elpida acquisition positions us as the world's best memory supplier and the industry dynamics are moving in our favor, we remain focused on optimizing value for our shareholders and worldwide customers.","I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.","Ronald Foster","Thanks, Mark. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year ended on August 29. Our website has a schedule containing certain key results for the fourth quarter as well as guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. That information is also presented on the following slides.","For our 2013 fiscal year, we reported net income of $1.2 billion or $1.13 per diluted share on net sales of $9.1 billion. The results for the year include one month of the consolidated results of Elpida since our acquisition closed on July 31. Elpida's results included Rexchip. The $1.5 billion non-operating gain recognized as part of the purchase accounting of Elpida is the result of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired being in excess of the purchase price.","Operating income for 2013, which excludes the gain on the Elpida acquisition, improved to $236 million compared to an operating loss of $612 million in fiscal 2012 as market conditions for memory products improved significantly around the beginning of this calendar year.","The schedule currently displayed summarizes the purchase accounting for Elpida. Several noteworthy items include. The $2.4 billion net assets acquired includes $3 billion of net working capital. Both cash and inventories were each just under $1 billion. The amount of inventory as of closing was written up as part of the purchase accounting to its fair value which Mark mentioned, and is based on the estimated selling prices for the products. As a result of this write up, we expect lower margins on sales of Elpida products in the first few months following the acquisition as we sell through the material that was subject to the write-up. Normal margins should return around the end of the first fiscal quarter.","The amount of property, plant, and equipment consolidated -- for consolidated Elpida, including the fabs in Hiroshima and Taiwan was $935 million. This reflects an approximately $2.1 billion reduction through purchase accounting compared to the U.S. GAAP values immediately prior to the acquisition. In addition, you may recall that the U.S. GAAP PP&E values of consolidated Elpida were previously written down by $2.8 billion through an impairment charge in the Elpida March 2012 financial statements. Other current and non-current assets include about $920 million of net deferred tax assets, such as net operating loss carry forwards which will be used over time to offset Japan income tax obligations.","Total acquired debt, giving effect to the plan of reorganization, is $2.1 billion. Our payment to acquire Elpida of 60 billion Yen or approximately US$615 million is shown on the balance sheet in restricted cash. Approximately $560 million of this balance will be used to make the first installment payment to the creditors later this month. The total installment payments due under the plan of reorganization of 200 billion Yen bears no interest. However, they have been discounted to a fair value of $1.638 billion using an imputed interest rate of 6.25%.","Concurrent with the closing of the Elpida acquisition, we also acquired Powerchip's 24% interest in Rexchip. Along with Elpida's ownership, we acquired a total of 89% of Rexchip. The remaining 11% represents substantially all of the non-controlling interest valued at $168 million reflected in the opening balance sheet.","The SEC disclosure rules require us to file certain historical financial statements of Elpida, along with pro forma financial statements. We anticipate filing those documents next week. That filing will contain audited Elpida financial statements as of and for the fiscal period ended February 28, 2013, as well as pro forma financial statements from Micron's fiscal 2012 and the nine months ended May 31, 2013. The pro forma financial statements contain additional detailed disclosures of the purchase accounting for Elpida. Further details of the actual purchase accounting will be included in our 10-K, which will be filed later this month.","For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $1.7 billion or $1.51 per diluted share on net sales of $2.8 billion. Obviously, these results include the $1.5 billion acquisition gain. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $207 million improved from $149 million in the third quarter, primarily due to an approximately 1 percentage point expanded gross margin and $46 million operating income contributed by Elpida, which includes the net effects of higher cost of goods sold from the stepped up inventory value, partially offset by lower depreciation from the equipment values that were written down in purchase accounting. These factors were partially offset by acquisition costs and restructuring impairment charges incurred at the Micron level during the quarter, which are enumerated on the following slide.","On a standalone basis, Elpida's consolidated results for the one month that was included in our fiscal Q4 included revenue of $355 million with 25% gross margin. Elpida's net income for the one month period was $29 million. We are continuing to present items included in the results of operations for the quarter that are particularly noteworthy or are not representative of company's trended economic performance. These items are presented to reconcile net income for the period as reported to net income excluding these certain items. Note that the amounts in the reconciliation do not include all the related income tax effects as the amounts are generally di minimis due to our net operating loss carry forwards and our global tax structure.","The most prominent item in the reconciliation is the gain recognized on the Elpida acquisition. Going the other way are the flow through in the fourth quarter of a portion of the stepped-up inventory value in the acquisition, in addition to the acquisition-related costs incurred in the quarter.","We recognized restart -- restructuring and impairment charges of $32 million, primarily from employee termination benefits associated with workforce reductions as we continue to optimize our global workforce structure and write-downs of certain assets in our Israel operation associated with their pending sale. The amortization of debt discount primarily reflects the imputed interest expense in the quarter from our convertible notes, as well as the discount on the interest free installment debt of Elpida.","Last quarter, we mentioned a gain we were to recognize in the fourth quarter of $48 million associated with our ownership in Inotera, as they sold shares to other parties at a price higher than our carrying value. The net effect of foreign currency activity was significantly reduced in the fourth quarter as we began hedging Elpida's non-USD exposures under our normal hedging policies as of the close of the acquisition. We expect to see some ongoing activity in this area, since we fully incorporated Elpida's balance sheet exposures, including the yen-denominated installment debt.","Non-cash income tax expenses primarily in Japan are offset by the deferred tax asset we recorded in purchase accounting. Adjusting for all these items, non-GAAP EPS improved to $0.29 per diluted share compared to the $0.16 per diluted share, adjusting for items in the third quarter.","You may have noted here as well as on previous slides the number of shares used in diluted EPS calculation has increased in the fourth quarter. The average stock price for the quarter increased the dilution from our convertible notes and stock options, both of which use the treasury stock method to determine the amount of dilution. The number of shares used in the diluted EPS calculation for the fourth quarter, includes 96 million shares from the dilutive effects of convertible notes and shares under our stock plans.","The capped calls that we have in place around our convertible notes while not reflected in the EPS calculation, economically reduced the dilution from the convertible notes by approximately 53 million shares at an assumed $18 share price. As our share price exceeds the upper strike price of the capped calls, their mitigating effect on the dilution is capped. As always, we are reviewing alternatives to manage our capital structure and we'll take advantage of opportunities we believe are in the best interest of our shareholders.","In the first quarter we project the following impacts from these adjustment items. Flow through of Elpida inventory step up reducing gross margin by $110 million to $120 million, Amortization of debt discount on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt of approximately $15 million. Non-cash taxes related to the acquisition of between $50 million to $60 million. Our ongoing cash tax rate is expected to be in the low single digit range. We expect restructuring and acquisition costs in the first quarter to be immaterial in the single-digit million dollar range.","Now, the more detailed discussion of our operating results will be at the combined company level, including the results of Elpida. In terms of the guidance that we provided for the fourth quarter, we generally executed within the targeted ranges we provided. Going forward, all of our guidance for the future periods will also be at the consolidated company level.","Turning first to DRAM. DRAM revenue for the combined company increased 50% in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter, reflecting a 42% increase in bit sales volume and 5% increase in per bit average selling prices.","One month of Elpida's results accounted for approximately 20% of the total bit shipments in the fourth quarter. The mix of Elpida's products averaged to a lower price when compared to Micron's average price. This is primarily a result of Micron's higher mix of premium ASP segments, such as networking and [AIM], while Elpida has a higher mix of sales in wafer form. Currently, Elpida sells approximately 20% of their volume in wafers which reduces the consolidated Micron average selling price and cost per bit correspondingly.","The cost for DRAM products increased in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter, mainly due to the higher cost of products purchased from Inotera which vary based on market prices. Our quarterly results also reflect our share of Inotera's net income. This is the first quarter since 2010 where equity method pick-up reflects income from Inotera, where execution in addition to the improvements in the memory industry has helped their return to profitability. Recall that we pick up Inotera's equity method results with a two month lag.","Now in terms of guidance for DRAM. Using quarter-to-date selling prices and projected product mix effects for the quarter, ASPs will be up mid-single digits compared to the Q4 average as a result of market increases, partially offset by the mix effect of lower Elpida average selling prices.","Projected bit costs are expected to be down low single digits relative to Q4, with the Elpida mix improving cost per bit, partially offset by higher costs from Inotera's market based pricing. Projected production volume is expected to be up mid-40s in the first quarter with a full three months of Elpida volume. We expect Elpida to account for approximately 60% of DRAM bit production in the first quarter.","Key themes affecting Q1 guidance include the relatively strong market conditions for DRAM pricing that Mark referenced and the continued transition of the former tech Singapore fab from DRAM to NAND. This transition is on track and expected to continue through the end of the fiscal year.","Now turning to NAND, Trade NAND sales increased 3% compared to the third quarter, which reflects 13% increase in bit sales volumes, offset by a 9% decrease in per bit average selling price. Margin on Trade NAND remained flat compared to the third quarter as the transition to higher density products brought about the offsetting effects of lower cost per part and lower per bit selling prices. NAND bits sold in Micron branded SSD increased 23% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by growth in the enterprise space as we continued to build out our product portfolio in this key segment which Mark Adams will talk about more in a bit.","Looking at our NAND guidance for the first quarter, using quarter to-date selling prices and projected mix for the quarter, Trade NAND ASPs would be down high-single digits with the decline driven by mix of higher density products on advanced technology nodes. Bit costs are expected to be down high-single digits as well, while bit production is expected to be up low to mid-teens as we transition our former tech Singapore fab to NAND production.","Key transfer Q1 affecting this guidance are the continued ramp of the former tech Singapore fab to NAND, although the majority of the output in the fourth quarter was still DRAM. And as NAND replaced to some NOR volume in the marketplace over time, I\u2019ll also add that revenue from NOR sales is expected to decline sequentially in Q1 as it did in Q4 to the $120 million to $130 million range.","SG&A expense guidance for Micron only in the fourth quarter did not include any acquisition-related costs. Adjusting for the $42 million acquisition-related costs in the quarter, SG&A was right in the middle of our guided range. We expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be between $185 million and $195 million, including Elpida's costs.","R&D expense for Micron only in the fourth quarter was at the high end of our guided range. Including Elpida for all the first quarter, we expect R&D expense to be between $340 million and $350 million.","The Company also generated $717 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter.","The year ended with cash and investments, including restricted cash and non-current investments of $4.2 billion. This amount includes the Elpida restricted cash of which approximately $560 million will be paid in the first installment payment later this month, as I mentioned previously.","Micron only capital spending during the fourth quarter was $286 million, which brought the fiscal year total to $1.4 billion at the low-end of our most recently guided range as Mark mentioned and well below our original guidance for the year.","Capital spending for the fourth quarter, including Elpida, was $332 million. Estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 of between $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion, contemplates all the spending for the Elpida and Rexchip operations, as we converge on our technology and product roadmaps. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase from $486 million in the fourth quarter to around $560 million in Q1.","During the fourth quarter, we received just over $300 million in additional asset-backed debt financing.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.","Mark Adams","Thanks, Ron. I will provide some more detail on our fourth quarter operating performance, as well as, share some thoughts on current market conditions.","Our NAND Solutions Group recorded revenue of $781 million, up 7% when compared to our third quarter. Total NAND gross margins increased slightly in the quarter as we continue to improve our mix. Our NAND ASPs were down 9% quarter-over-quarter, partially driven by an increase in higher density, lower price per gigabyte SSD products and partially driven by early production capacity from our fab seven conversion, ending up in a transactional market such as memory cards and USB devices which generally produce a lower ASP.","Our SSD business is growing significantly faster than the overall SSD market. Micron branded SSD revenue for the year was 76% over 2012. It's worth noting that over 50% of our trade NAND revenue goes to either Micron branded SSDs or our strategic customers who serve the SSD category with Micron's NAND technology.","We continued to migrate our SSD product family to advanced lithography nodes. Our 20-nanometer flash memory technology represented 40% of our client SSD shipments and our 25-nanometer process represented over 80% of our enterprise shipments. Our newly announced M500 based on our 20-nanometer technology is seeing strong acceptance not only in client, but data center applications.","We've also qualified two new enterprise drives at Tier-1 OEMs, our P410 flash drive and our P420 PCIe drive.","On the technology front, Micron introduced its industry leading 16-nanometer MLC NAND, the most advanced processing node for any current product produced in the semiconductor device industry. For this accomplishment, Micron won the Best Technology Award, at the 2013 Flash Memory Summit held in August.","We're pleased with the results from our NAND business and continue to look for ways to drive higher value features and functionalities to an increasingly segmented market. Our DRAM Solutions Group recorded a 34% increase in top line revenue, with sales of $1.24 billion in Q4, which included one month of Elpida data. Excluding this Elpida sales for August, revenue was up 16% quarter-on-quarter, driven primarily by an increase in DRAM ASPs for the second consecutive quarter.","DSG gross margins were in the mid-20% range, up about 1% from our third quarter. Keep in mind that Q4 and Q1 DRAM gross margins are and in the near term will be negatively impacted by the flow through of Elpida's inventory which was written up to market value at close as Ron described in his purchase accounting comments earlier.","We achieved record bit shipments in all of our premium DRAM segments, with the non-PC business representing about 55% of our gigabit shipments in the quarter. We shipped over 300 million gigabit equivalents into the server DRAM segment in Q4, driven by strong demand from our data center customers and cloud service providers. For fiscal 2013, this is a 53% year-over-year increase in bit shipments, which represented a 13% increase in revenue.","We had a record quarter in our networking business for both bits up 5% and revenue up 8%. RLDRAM shipments set a company record as we\u2019re seeing a strong demand from Tier-1 OEMs, as well as through our distribution channel.","We also had a strong quarter in our consumer graphic segment, which continues to be an attractive premium market. Bit shipments were up 38% quarter-on-quarter and we expect strong demand in Q1, in particular looking forward to the upcoming launch of next-generation gaming consoles for this holiday season. Elpida's GDDR5 technology rounds out our portfolio in this fast-growing segment.","On the technology front, we recently announced our Hybrid Memory Cube interoperability with FPGA platform from Altera, a major milestone for us in this new solution for the high-performance networking and computing segment. In addition, our RLDRAM III product continues to receive strong market endorsement from out Tier-1 networking customers.","We are seeing strong yield improvement in our 25-nanometer process technology and will continue to ramp this technology through fiscal 2014. We are also on track to introduce our 20-nanometer technology beginning in the second half of calendar 2014.","Overall the DRAM market remains tight. Given growing demand in the specialty markets and under supply in the PC DRAM business and the impact on supplies from the Wuxi accident, inventories appears extremely low across both our OEM customer base and at distribution channel. We are on allocation with customers in multiple segments.","OEM contract pricing, while increasing, continues to lag the rising spot market. Our specialty business typically lags the market in terms of price movement, but we are seeing increases across these segments as well. We are optimistic that the DRAM market will remain strong through the end of calendar year 2013.","When you include one month of Elpida's mobile business, revenue for the Wireless Solutions Group was up 70% quarter-over-quarter, coming up on Q3 where revenue was up roughly 30% from the prior quarter. Without the Elpida impact, revenues for WSG were flat quarter-over-quarter as we were able to redirect some capacity to higher margin opportunities in computing. Q4 gross margins swung from a negative 4% to a positive 8% in the quarter.","Mobile DRAM was up 300% quarter-over-quarter, including Elpida, highlighted by increased low-power DRAM share at Tier-1 customers. Mobile DRAM margins improved significantly in Q4 on increased shipments of our 30-nanometer low-power DRAM product.","Our mobile NAND revenue was constrained in the quarter, but gross margins were up mid-single digits compared to Q3. Our NOR based MCP business saw demand continue to decline with margin pressure from idle charges.","In the past, I've talked about the restructuring of our Micron only mobile business, WSG. We have taken significant costs out of the business and managed our mobile inventory to an all-time low as we prepare for the integration of Elpida's mobile business with WSG. We feel as one combined mobile business, Micron has the strongest mobile memory portfolio in the industry. We are excited about the combined mobile organization scale and product breadth in both low power DRAM and managed NAND, positioning Micron as a leader in mobile memory solutions.","Our Embedded Solutions Group recorded sales of $329 million, up 8% quarter-over-quarter, setting a record for ESG quarterly revenue. Investment in geographic expansion continues to pay off as we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and Asia.","Operating profit remained strong at 19% as our team concluded a solid fiscal year 2013. For the year, revenue was up 13% in our embedded business, as we grew shipments across DRAM, NAND and NOR to a broadening customer base. Our automotive and industrial segment experienced 19% top line growth year-over-year.","With the recent announcement of our field system labs in Germany and Shanghai, we feel we are uniquely positioned to partner with our embedded customers in presale systems architectural design, qualification and post-sale support. This level of customer engagement is the type of service that will continue to differentiate Micron's offering as we look to scale our embedded business.","On the technology front, the team has done a great job marketing Micron's broad portfolio in a segment that was once dominated primarily by NOR shipments. In fact, today our ESG revenue mix is relatively evenly split between DRAM, NAND and NOR. We are currently ramping our 45-nanometer serial and parallel NOR products at our 300 millimeter fab in Virginia and we are in qualification with key ESG customers. We remain optimistic that we will see continued growth from ESG in fiscal 2014 as we increase investments in both technology and levels of differentiated service.","Overall, the memory business remained in favorable balance from a demand and supply perspective throughout our fourth quarter. Demand signals from our customers are strong and we are in allocation mode across DRAM with general balance in NAND. The teams were able to execute in key areas such as specialty DRAM, enterprise storage, automotive and industrial and low-power mobile solutions in Q4 and we feel well positioned for a strong Q1.","In closing, I want to welcome our new team members from the former Elpida and Rexchip teams. We are very impressed with the quality of people, technology, and strong customer relationships that are now part of Micron.","With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.","Kipp Bedard","Thank you, Mark. What we'd like to do now is take questions from callers. (Operator instructions). Please open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Glen Young with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Adeline Lee \u2013 Citigroup","This is Adeline Lee for Glen Young. My first question is, can you tell us a little bit about your CapEx split and also CapEx loading?","Mark Durcan","This is Mark. We gave you already the CapEx spend projected for the year. In terms of how that's split technology wise, a little bit more than half on DRAM with the remainder to build out incremental 80 and 90 series NAND conversion which is 20 -- conversion to 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer as well as some early spend on 3D NAND.","Adeline Lee \u2013 Citigroup","And then can you also sort of help us in terms of ASPs. After the Wuxi fire at Hynix, what do you think pricing will do before -- when they get back to their normal loading sometime in the first half of 2014? What do you think pricing will do?","Mark Adams","This is Mark Adams. As we typically don't do, we\u2019ll not comment on future pricing. There\u2019s a lot of variables we just don't have a handle on in terms of what the competitive recovery would look like. Obviously, we are in a situation that since then up until quarter to-date, it's further tightened, was a tightening market, but we're not in a position of predicting future pricing.","Mark Durcan","Yeah, I think as well as that, I would just add that it's still a little unclear to us at least exactly when there will be a full recovery, so trying to get the dynamics around how that all plays out over time is very difficult.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Your operating margins on DRAM segments are much higher than the NAND segment. And you're also guiding to ASP increase in DRAM and ASP decline in NAND. So the question is then why not delay the conversion of Singapore fab from DRAM to NAND for maybe a quarter or two quarters?","Mark Durcan","What I said, Monika is that we haven't changed our trajectory yet. And what we said in the past is we want to maintain a high degree of flexibility and be reactive to our customer needs and what's going on in the marketplace, so we can optimize margins. So, I'm not going to comment on what we might do going forward. We're going to continue to watch the market pretty carefully and do what we need to do for Micron and our customers.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","The next one is on the WSG segment. The revenues increased considerably of course due to Elpida's mobile DRAM business, but operating margins are still in the negative, right? So I'm just trying to understand the dynamics there. Is it that inventory because of that lower gross margin from Elpida assets? Could you just walk a little bit on that side please?","Mark Adams","There is that. I think you're hitting on a couple of areas that are relevant, but also remember there\u2019s a three months, basically a full quarter inventory flow through which will be much more positive when we get through that period as well.","Ronald Foster","There is also one month in there of Elpida in the reported results.","Mark Adams","Let me take this chance also just to comment that in the mobile business, we are currently -- we are strategically looking at a margin business, not a scale business. And so where we see opportunities to use our capacity for specialized and differentiated product in mobile, that's what we're focused on. We're not trying to necessarily grow the top line in mobile just to grow it, and I think from our perspective, when you add all those factors together, you'll continue to see hopefully us make announcements around differentiated products.","Operator","Our next question in the phone queue will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Joseph Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","The 17% growth in NAND bits, you had talked about production up high single-digits early in the quarter. Was that from inventory or did you have upside from the production numbers that you thought you'd have?","Mark Durcan","Yes, Joe, you're correct. That was actually reported a production number. So, production numbers came in even better. I think Mark mentioned in his script that in particular we were pleased to see that the 20-nanometer NAND is now more than 50% of our bits produced. So we\u2019re pretty pleased with how the team executed.","Mark Adams","Looping back also, Joe to the tech conversion, again while we\u2019re going to monitor that as the market continues to evolve, that transition went better than we ever could have possibly expected, that the yields are phenomenal there, and it\u2019s been very, very smooth.","Joseph Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And then in terms of the tax rate that you talked about, at the analyst meeting you guys have talked about the disparity between kind of a cash tax rate and then the non-GAAP from the true up of the NOLs around fair value, are we going to be able to get visibility into what the difference is between those two tax rates going forward?","Ronald Foster","Joe, this is Ron. I showed you the effect in the latest reported quarter, and I gave you a projection for the first quarter, so we will continue to pro forma that each quarter and give you the breakdown. The fact is that it's easier for us to actually project the cash tax rate and it\u2019s going to be in the low-single digit range over time, because of our tax structure and that\u2019s what we'll actually be paying in taxes. The GAAP tax rate is more difficult to figure out because it's an estimated effective tax rate based upon your projected annual profits or pre-tax profits. So I can give you a pretty good diagnosis of cash tax rates, and in each quarter we'll break out the non-cash portion that's in our GAAP number.","Operator","Our next question in queue comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Congrats on all the execution of all the moving parts here. Is there any way you can help me get what the gross margins would have been if you had recorded Elpida product at manufacturing cost as opposed to the marked up?","Mark Durcan","Doug, if you look at my schedule on the pro forma, you should be able to pull that out because we\u2019ve showed the step up amount of the inventory around $40 million for the fourth quarter, $41 million on the non-GAAP schedule that I provided when I made my prepared comments, so that's the difference.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So it's not a significant number this quarter?","Mark Durcan","Pardon me?","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So it ends up \u2013 great. The $41 million, it's not going to move my gross margins multiple percentage points this quarter. Going forward though it will have a more material --","Mark Durcan","Going forward, I gave you the estimate, $110 million to $120 million in Q1.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And then I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. You were talking Inotera bits, even post-acquisition integration, Inotera bits in DRAM are going to make up 60%. Did I hear that correctly?","Mark Durcan","No. In DRAM, Elpida bits make ups -- would be make up around 60% of our production in Q1 of DRAM production.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","How much is Inotera?","Mark Durcan","Well, it's a part of the remainder, the larger part of the remainder.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Because those bits are at the cost plus accounting method?","Ronald Foster","Market minus.","Mark Durcan","The Inotera bits are market minus, and Elpida is part of our consolidated result. So, does that address your question?","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","It does. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","It seems like once again your business in the enterprise market is better than you would have thought of three months ago. Just curious if you could talk especially on the SSD side, you mentioned some of the product successes. As you look out into this quarter, where do you see that going? Then secondly, on the server side, I wonder if you can give some more color around where you're being successful on the DRAM sales because again it looked it was doing better than you would have thought three months ago. Thanks.","Mark Adams","This is Mark Adams. I think that -- we feel that we've got pretty good momentum, both in terms of customer engagement and rounding out our product portfolio in the enterprise space. So we see continued growth there. On the DRAM server side, I think we were actually mildly constrained in Q4. So we have -- reasonably that's going to remain pretty strong through the quarter. ","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Just a follow-up along that line. You mentioned [web scale] customers as being part of the driver. And I think you've also talked about the risks around the linearity of those customers. Is that something that played out in the quarter at all? Do you expect that to play out in calendar fourth quarter? How do you see that market evolving near-term?","Mark Adams","So far until quarter-to-date, we think that it's been mildly capacity constrained with good capacity bits being able to serve that space. So we haven't seen any detriment to suggest otherwise. Again, I think we're getting some tailwinds on customer engagements in this business with our product portfolio that again we feel pretty positive and bullish going forward.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","And then just wrapping all that, I was just curious, as you apply all that to margins, how do you feel in terms of products, whether it\u2019s SSDs or selling in the server market where -- are your margins optimized at this point in either product line or would you say there is room to improve there? Thanks.","Mark Adams","Yeah, again, we probably won't touch that one in terms of future margins and future ASPs.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the capacity plans at Elpida, Hiroshima fab and also Rexchip in terms of what shrinks you're going to do over the next couple of quarters with the CapEx and transitions both on the mobile and PC DRAM side.","Mark Durcan","This is Mark Durcan. At Elpida, we have a 25-nanometer ramp well underway and that's going quite smoothly. There has been some early activity at Rexchip as well, although that would go maybe at a more muted pace. And we'll continue to monitor how we have our computing and DRAM mix and that may get things more than technology introduction at Rexchip as we try and get that mix right. But generally speaking we have product running at both those fabs and the 25-nanometer node. 20-nanometer is really a second calendar half of 2014 story. There will be activity in the first half, but it will production in the second half of 2014. In NAND, as we said before, we're over 50% 20-nanometer NAND already and well into our 15-nanometer ramp which has gone very well.","James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about understanding you want to keep your options open and keep things flexible regarding the tech transition to NAND. But sitting here looking at today, would you expect that transition to be complete from an output perspective by the end of the calendar first or second quarter?","Mark Durcan","I want to keep a little mystery in that dynamic.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just real quickly, on the ASP guidance for DRAM in the November quarter, curious much of that is being influenced by the addition of Elpida for three months in the quarter, i.e., if you just look at the core Micron and Inotera DRAM ASPs, any sense of how you can tell us how that would have trended Q-on-Q?","Ronald Foster","This is Ron. John, if you look at there are couple of effects, James. One is the --John, excuse me, the flow of market prices, which are up stronger than the average guidance we're giving. But the Elpida product mix has a lower average price than that of historical Micron. As I mentioned in my comments, this pushes down the average ASP in Q1 as you work that into the total mix for a full quarter. Everything else being equal, I would estimate that based on today's pricing that the Elpida mix is taking us down in our average in the high-single digit range. So the guidance we gave you is muted by the fact that the Elpida mix is dropping us down in the high-single digit range on average using quarter-to-date pricing and estimated mix.","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s very helpful, Ron. Then either for Mark Durcan or Mark Adams. Guys, there\u2019s been a lot made about the NAND transition from planar to 3D. I'm wondering if you could help me better understand the Moore's law issues on DRAM, especially as we get below the 20-nanometer node. Seeing a lot of white papers out there about whether or not we've got the right materials, what the cost curve is going to start to look like. So just generically as we think about the shrink capacity in DRAM, how does that look over the next several years?","Mark Durcan","Sorry. Is the question is relative to NAND or DRAM or a little of both?","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse","No, to DRAM specifically. I think investors have vetted the 2D to 3D in NAND. I'm just curious about what's going on in DRAM from a technology perspective? And is there a chance here that the shrink growth slows here as we get below the 20 nanometer node?","Mark Durcan","Absolutely. I think it's inevitable that the pace of technology node migration is going to continue to slow. There's no -- it's interesting because it's not like NAND where there\u2019s really a hard stop on planar NAND. It just becomes very, very difficult with a floating [detail] to make it work at all below about 50 nanometers. But DRAM has a lot of bags in the trick -- a lot of tricks in the bag, sorry. It's just an economic challenge to make that all play out. So I think you're going to continue to see technology migration, but maybe addressing smaller segments where there is some particular form factor need or performance need, as well as just a longer trajectory to get to the next node. But you will see nodes well below 20 nanometers over the next five to seven years.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","I'm just wondering, when you look at mobile, I know you gave out your expectations for DRAM, but when you look at mobile DRAM for next year, where do you think mobile DRAM grows? Also, on the NAND side, what's your split between SSD and OEM retail now?","Mark Durcan","Vijay, are you asking that from a Micron perspective or a market perspective?","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","If you can give me both for mobile DRAM.","Mark Durcan","I\u2019ll give you market. Like Mark, I don't want to -- I want to keep some mystery in exactly what we do with our mix. But basically what you're seeing per handset only, you're looking at an average megabytes per phone of about 450 going to just over 700 in 2014. On the NAND side we're looking at something just below an average of 5 gigabytes of phone going to something just over six and that includes all handsets, an average of all handsets in.","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","And on the NAND side what's your split between SSD and OEM retail?","Mark Durcan","Again from a market segment standpoint?","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","Yeah, from Micron standpoint.","Mark Durcan","I would say from a Micron standpoint, we're running around 50% of revenues from SSD and around 30% from consumer and around 10% mobile.","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","Last question here. I know there\u2019s a lot of focus on free cash flow. When you look at CapEx next year, I know it's coming down. Any thoughts on that? I know you've guided to $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion for fiscal '14, but you expect it to come down a little bit. Where do you think it comes in?","Ronald Foster","After that period, so you are looking at 2015?","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","Yes.","Ronald Foster","I think we'll hold off on that one for now too.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your questions please.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","One simple one. R&D, your guidance for the November quarter, $340 million to $350 million. Does this include -- is there some opportunity for rationalization of R&D going forward? Do you have duplication that you plan to eliminate so that the R&D will drop in future quarters?","Ronald Foster","David, it's Ron. Yeah. Obviously, we've just got the acquisition together and we're looking at our go-forward strategies for all of our operating structures and there certainly are opportunities. The general structure of OpEx, both for R&D and SG&A at Elpida was similar to ours as a percent of revenue. So it doesn't radically change the percents of where we are right now. Going forward, obviously we'll be looking at efficiencies and synergies that we can derive across the whole cost structure.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","And just to push a bit further on that CapEx question. I understand you don't want to give guidance for the out year. But within that $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion, are there any special charges that you're taking or special costs that you\u2019re incurring to integrate all your facilities? And can you quantify those for us that are one-term lead type things?","Ronald Foster","No. There\u2019s really not. It's really just the technology migration across the entire network.","Kipp Bedard","Unfortunately we only have time for about one more question.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Daniel Amir with Lazard. Please go ahead, your questions please.","Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","So just a quick question. Just in terms of DRAM mix, what's the consideration here in terms of changing the DRAM mix here over time now that you have Elpida. In terms of looking at increasing the networking or server DRAM versus mobile and PC, what's the considerations here? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Some of that, Daniel is really qualifying and getting those products into these applications and internally qualifications as well as getting them qualified at the customer level. But the opportunity we believe is significant. We're obviously not going to quantify it here on this call, but you've heard reference today to historical revenue from Elpida around wafer sales and personal computing and mobile. They obviously haven't in the past been very successful in getting over there to these specialty markets. And quite frankly, our customers you can see we had records in basically all of our specialty markets and we feel like we were constrained. There was more upside there. So we think the opportunity is there. Our job is to go make that happen.","Ronald Foster","At the highest level, we're not seeking any market share segments in any particular segment. We\u2019re seeking to optimize our margins across the segments and drive differentiated products that have enduring values.","Kipp Bedard","With that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

And welcome to Micron Technology\u2019s fourth quarter and 2016 fiscal year financial release conference call. On the call today with me are Mark Durcan, CEO and Director; and Ernie Maddock, Chief Financial Officer.","This conference call, including audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com. In addition, our website contains an earnings press release filed a short while ago and supplemental information including quarterly operational and financial metrics and guidance, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, slides used during today\u2019s conference call, and a convertible debt and capped call dilution table.","Today\u2019s call will be approximately 60 minutes in length.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer you to the documents the Company files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for a complete discussion of these important risk factors and other risks that may affect our future results.","Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today\u2019s call to conform these statements to actual results.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin of 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range and together generated earnings per share that exceeded guidance. Operating cash flow was $896 million.","On the last call, we reported that while we were seeing signs of improvement in selected markets, we were uncertain of the extent and the duration of the improvements. During the quarter, we continue to see market conditions improve driven by both supply and demand fundamentals. Industry inventory appears lean and the current market outlook for both NAND and DRAM continues to be positive. Currently prices are increasing in number of segments, stabilizing in others and we\u2019re seeing fewer segments showing residual declines.","This environment frames our thinking and the guidance that Ernie will provide a little later on. We made significant progress on a number of key initiatives in the quarter including the completion of the mobile product qualifications that we\u2019ve been discussing in our early 1X nanometer DRAM deployment. We\u2019re also seeing the benefits of the 3D NAND yield ramp, which generated stronger than expected NAND bit growth in the quarter.","I\u2019m going to provide a high level overview of each of the business units and Ernie will follow with more details on each business\u2019s financial performance. In our compute and networking business unit, we experienced accelerating revenue growth in the face of moderating pricing environment. Revenue growth was driven by continued increases of 20-nanometer shipments as well as a significant transition to DDR4 and the cloud and client segments where shipments exceeded DDR3 for the first time. We saw ongoing strength to graphics driven by GDDR5 and 5-X products, which supported NVIDIA\u2019s introduction of the 5-X based TITAN X, the highest performance consumer graphics card in the market. In the enterprise segment, Micron was recognized at the Flash Memory Summit as the innovation leader in non-volatile DIMMs, an important solution of high performance servers.","Turning to our mobile business unit, China is becoming a more significant growth driver in mobile devices. Most of these devices are differentiated by large amounts of memory including up to 6 gigabytes low power DRAM. Additionally, the top of the line Apple and Samsung models now ship with 256 gigabytes of NAND and we see mid range Chinese handsets heading in the same direction in order to compete. Although there is a moderating pace of smartphone unit growth, significant content increases of both NAND and DRAM will generate strong overall bit growth. During the quarter, we introduced four new mid to high density mobile 3D NAND products with positive reviews from the press and from our customer base. Mobile DRAM and eMCP price declines moderated in the quarter with more recent signs of stabilization and increases.","Revenue growth in our embedded business unit has been driven by a record automotive business and increased performance in the consumer and connected homes segments as well as the strengthening industrial multimarket business during the quarter. We have maintained our leadership position in automotive through strong customer support and the introduction of new products that meet the fast growing memory content requirements for infotainment, ADAS and instrument cluster applications. High temperature DRAM and automotive grade NAND products are enabling a strong design win pipeline.","The introduction of several new industrial solutions has positioned us to grow our share within IMM and retain our high market share in machine to machine communication modules as the industry migrates from 2G to 4G and LTE. We\u2019ve also been successful in achieving strong market share positions in consumer applications from action cameras and home automation to high volume markets including digital TV and set top boxes.","Finally, our storage business unit is continuing to transition its product line to our leading edge 3D NAND technology. We\u2019ve seen positive response from customers this quarter related to our refreshed SSD portfolio which offers a breadth of solutions to meet diverse application requirements. We\u2019re finalizing qualification with eight major OEMs on our 1,100 client drive and are engaging with cloud customers on future designs. In the enterprise, we\u2019re seeing companies begin to retrofit HDD infrastructures with SAS SSDs as they modernize existing investments. Our customers and demand executives like financial services and energy are moving stores closer to the server. We have seen significant interest in our PCIe NVMe drives in these applications due to their ability to deliver very consistent high performance. We\u2019re actively extending TLC 3D NAND across our cloud and enterprise portfolio and expect to introduce our first TLC 3D SATA drive for these markets later this year followed by a server focused version early next year. We expect to see positive supply and demand dynamics in the SSD market for 2017.","Turning to the memory industry more generally, we\u2019ve seen further evidence that DRAM wafer output is declining as a result of lost throughput related to the 20-nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions. Absent some replacement of these wafers, we could see industry supply growth as low as mid-teens in 2017. As some of lost wafer output is replaced, industry supply growth could be in the high-teens percent range. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid 20% range. ","For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid 40% range. Despite significant investments in 3D conversions across the industry, we believe that 2017 supply growth will be relatively balanced with demand given the disruption in the fab output related to these conversions.","For our operational priorities for fiscal 2017, or our operational priorities for fiscal 2017 continue to be targeted at ramping advanced technologies with an added focus on building out a more robust product portfolio, in particular for non-volatile memory products.","For DRAM, we begin the 1X nanometer ramp and expect to have meaningful output by the middle of 2017. At our winter Analyst Day, we shared two-year bit growth targets for DRAM and we are on track to meet to these targets. We were slightly below the range in fiscal 2017 (sic) [2016] and expect to be above the range in fiscal 2017. All of the DRAM bit growth will come from technology transitions and we currently have no plans to add wafer capacity. We expect our fiscal 2017 DRAM cost per bit to decline 20% to 25%, as a result of completing the 20-nanometer migration and initiating the 1X nanometer conversion. Our cash cost for bit declines will be meaningfully higher than this range.","For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen 1 3D as well as TLC. As we updated at our last Analyst Meeting, 3D bit output will exceed 2D output in the current quarter ahead of our initial target. We will also be working on deploying second generation 64 layer 3D technology. Similar to DRAM, our 2016 NAND bit growth came in below the two-year CAGR shared at our analyst event and we therefore expect 2017 to be above that range. We are forecasting our fiscal 2017 NAND cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of the 3D and TLC conversions. This cost per bit includes the impact of our planned build out of SSDs, eMCPs and Managed NAND solutions all of which carry additional bill of materials costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix. On a like-for-like basis, cost per bit will decline more substantially.","Relative to 3D Xpoint technology, we are working with market enablers on adoption of our QuantX solutions and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron\u2019s future success with initial revenue later in 2017.","Now, I would like to turn the mic over to Ernie.","Ernie Maddock","Thank you, Mark. We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution coupled with a more favorable business environment resulted in improved financial performance. I\u2019ll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the Company\u2019s results for the quarter and guidance for our first fiscal quarter 2017.","DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile represented about 25%, similar to the prior quarter; the PC segment was in the upper 20% range, up slightly from the prior quarter; server business was in the high teens percent range, down from the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 30% range, up from the prior quarter and primarily driven by an increase in graphics which represented more than 10% for the quarter.","In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 50%, down slightly from the prior quarter; mobile was in the high teens percent range, up from 13% in the prior quarter as we began to see the impact of our completed customer quals. As a remainder eMCPs are primarily in the Mobile segment. SSDs represented 13% similar to last quarter and the automotive, industrial, multi market and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range similar to prior quarter.","Turning to performance by business unit, the compute & networking business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.25 billion, up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by 20-nanometer shipment growth accompanied by strengthening demand in a moderating pricing environment across all segments. The non-GAAP operating loss was $7 million or less than 1% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, conversions to DDR4 are now largely complete and we are focused on enabling our solutions for the next generation server platform. We are seeing continued interest in both higher density RDIMMs and LRDIMMs as well as NVDIMM solutions. The cloud component of the enterprise segment is growing quickly driven by continued growth in density across both DDR3 and DDR4 solutions.","In graphics, we saw a growth well above typical seasonality, driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5-X products. There are additional G5-X based product announcements from NVIDIA in both the graphics and workstation segments during the quarter. In networking, we enjoyed double digit revenue growth with strength across all regions and growing interest in applying the high bandwidth capabilities of GDDR5 and GDDR5-X to the networking segment.","Finally within the client segment, we saw market demand which exceeded our expectation as well as a continued transition to DDR4 which for the first time represented a majority of client shipments.","The mobile business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $671 million, up 20% sequentially, driven by a strong quarter in our eMCP products. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 7% of revenue and was partially impacted by the consumption of higher cost early production inventory accumulated over the last two quarters. We saw significant growth in the recently qualified higher density MCPs and as smartphone OEMS are positioning their products based on higher memory density specifications, which is helping to accelerate adoption of smartphones with richer memory content.","The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $513 million, up 5% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $133 million or 26% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by record automotive and increasing consumer business combined with some recovery in our industrial multi-market business.","The automotive business delivered solid results with revenue up 6% sequentially driven by strong and increasing demand for both DRAM and eMMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and advanced driver assistance systems applications. European, Korean and Japanese customers continue to fuel this growth and our portfolio of leading edge automotive grade solutions is continuing to enable platform design wins. The industrial and multi-market business increased 16% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our NOR and NAND based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules.","Consumer and connected home revenue was up 7% sequentially with solid demand for MCPs used in action cameras and home automation applications. We continue to see this demand pattern continue in the current fiscal quarter, which typically sees strong seasonal demand. Our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into set-top boxes and IMM applications.","The storage business delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $758 million, up 5% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $69 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we entered production and OEM qualification of TLC 3D NAND-based SSDs in the clients and consumer segments, providing customers with a refreshed 3D-based portfolio as storage products expand the demand spectrum in these markets. In the enterprise SSD segment, consecutive quarter bits sold were up 45% based on higher sales of our planar MLC based cloud drive. We are deploying 3D TLC across the enterprise nm cloud portfolio with several product launches over the next two quarters.","Moving on to overall company results, revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $3.2 billion at the top end of our guided range and up 11% sequentially. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by moderating ASP declines, while trade NAND shipments increased as a result of early success of our 3D ramp and we experienced generally stable ASPs. Gross margin for the quarter was 18% also at the top end of our guided range.","The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $56 million or $0.05 per share, significantly better than the guidance. For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP profitability despite our technology transition and memory market pricing pressure achieving non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, Micron included both amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock compensation expense in our fiscal Q4 non-GAAP results. Taken together, these two items represent $0.04 a share in the fourth fiscal quarter and $0.20 per share for the full 2016 fiscal year.","Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 13% compared to the prior quarter, as a result of a 20% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a 6% decrease in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter increased two percentage points to 20%, primarily driven by strong cost reductions as a result of the continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 12% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a 1% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 16% as cost per bit was up related to the 3D ramp and build out of higher cost storage and mobile solutions to support future growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $559 million. This was below our guidance, primarily due to continued expense control and the timing of prequalification expenses for the fourth quarter, some of which will now occur in fiscal Q1. The Company generated operating cash flow of $896 million, which included strong quarter for collection activity and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.8 billion. In the fourth fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributes were approximately $1.7 billion.","Before I move on to our guidance for the upcoming quarter, I want to share some changes to our reporting. The first of these changes relates to the depreciation schedule for our DRAM capital equipment. Previously, this equipment had been depreciated over five years. However, given the longer intervals between technology transitions, we have changed the depreciable life of our DRAM capital equipment from five years to seven years. This change will reduce depreciation by approximately 100 million per quarter on a going forward basis. The depreciation schedule for NAND related equipment remains unchanged. Additionally, and to be consistent with the majority of semiconductor companies who report non-GAAP results, Micron will exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquisition related intangibles from our non-GAAP reporting. These expenses on average are approximately $50 million per quarter.","Moving on now to our guidance for the first fiscal quarter, which we developed in the context of the market environment that Mark described earlier, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion; gross margin in the range of 23% to 25.5%; operating expenses between $600 million and $650 million due to the resumption of variable compensation expense and the higher pre-qual expenses that we spoke of earlier. Taken together, these items represent a sequential increase of approximately $80 million of which $25 million resulted from the timing of pre-qual between fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. Operating income in the range of $245 million to $330 million, and EPS ranging between $0.13 and $0.21 per share based on 1,046 million diluted shares.","Relative to our capital spending plans for fiscal \u201817, as we shared last month, we expect to spend between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion net of partner contributions. Between 40% and 50% of the total will be allocated to DRAM; between 30% and 40% to non-volatile memory; and between 15% and 25% to technology and product enablement. Consistent with our public comments, this level of CapEx allows us to appropriately fund our technology investments while achieving neutral to positive free cash flow generation in fiscal 2017. Operationally, we are on track to deliver the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we previously shared as we complete the 20-nanometer DRAM conversion, reach crossover of first generation 3D NAND this quarter and commence the ramp of 1X nanometer DRAM and second generation 3D NAND in 2017. For FY17 specifically, we expect DRAM and NAND cost per bit reductions between 20% and 25%.","Finally relative to the Inotera transaction, Micron and Inotera have concluded that sufficient progress has been made in Inotera addressing the issues that caused the delay in closing. An Inotera board meeting has been scheduled for October 11th and the directors of Inotera are expected to set a share swap record date at that meeting. We anticipate that the share swap record date will be set for the first half of December of 2016. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we faced challenging market conditions in fiscal 2016 and envision to going through a transition period of our technology migrations. Despite these headwinds, we ended the year with positive non-GAAP EPS. Compared to prior cycles, this represents a material improvement in our performance and further reinforces our belief in structural industry improvements. We are now experiencing a more positive and improving environment, and Micron is committed to making even further improvements in our relative performance with enhanced growth and cost reductions and expanded capability to deliver value added products to enable our customers.","Okay, operator, we are now ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question Ernie for you on the pricing front. I know you don\u2019t want to go into specific details but curious if you think about November, what you\u2019re embedding in terms of I guess changes to mix and perhaps any flow-through of lower margin inventory, and any other kind of factors that we should be thinking about as it relates to DRAM ASPs?","Mark Durcan","This is Mark. Maybe I\u2019ll take that one C.J. Certainly relative to the sell-through of inventory, there is an impact there, given some of the inventory we built up over the last couple of quarters relative to the qualifications we mentioned. Relative to market assumptions, we\u2019re not going to get into the detail as always of the embedded margin because we don\u2019t want to forecast the ASPs. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re seeing some early signs of significant price movements. And as we\u2019ve done in the past, we want to wait before we get ahead of ourselves in projecting what may come as we move further out into the quarter but I do think that the trend is positive and the bias is positive.","C.J. Muse","It\u2019s really helpful. I guess as my follow up, how do you think about channel inventory today? And I guess this is another DRAM question. And then as part of that how do you expect customers to act as you look into 2017 in an environment where bit supply is sub-20% and demand presumably higher than that? How do you expect the kind of changes in behavior there? Thank you.","Mark Durcan","Certainly if we think about inventory in the marketplace, certainly channel inventory I think is very, very tight, maybe one to two weeks or less than a week. At the major customers, we have less precision relative to that but I\u2019d say, it\u2019s certainly down and there is a sense of urgency at the large OEM customers as well. In some cases, we may be looking at allocation of certain products in certain markets. And certainly the customers are beginning to ask for longer-term price commitments, which is in my mind always a good thing. And we\u2019ll look at those on a case-by-case basis and potentially take customers up on that where appropriate but obviously always keeping the long-term interest of shareholders in mind.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit Shah","Yes. I just want to come back to the guidance because it\u2019s something that people are trying to sort of gauge given that last quarter at least relative to how you originally guided, you guys came in a lot better. And I know at the time that there was a lot of moving pieces and you guys wanted to give yourself cushion. So, could you talk a little bit about visibility and at least on the pricing front if we could get a sense just directionally how you are thinking about ASPs in the November period? And then I have a follow-up.","Ernie Maddock","Romit, sure. This is Ernie. So, I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that although we beat our EPS guidance, we actually were well in the ranges of both our revenue and our gross margin guidance. And so, we did think about the opportunity that was ahead of ourselves as we were giving the guidance for the last quarter and we\u2019ve done the same thing in essence this quarter as well. So, I think you can look at the range of our guidance and it generally contemplates the outcomes that we see. And obviously if things continue on a strong and favorable momentum, it\u2019s reasonable to think that you\u2019d end up at the upper end of both pieces of the range which would generate a result similar to this quarter. And I think consistent with Mark\u2019s prior comments, we are continuing to see positive momentum. I do think it\u2019s important to understand that that momentum has existed and has started to strengthen and so as a result of its actual impact in our fiscal quarter with part of it already completed and we\u2019re in negotiations for others, I think the trap we want to avoid is presuming that whatever the latest pricing news is gets retroactively applied across the entire quarter because that\u2019s certainly not the environment that we\u2019re living in. But I do think we were pretty thoughtful about the revenue range. And obviously we\u2019re going to work hard and try to do as well as we can but we\u2019ve put a lot of thought behind the numbers we have just shared with you.","Romit Shah","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Mark, I have a strategic question for you which is you talk about one of the priorities being to just ramp advanced products in non-volatile memory but at the same time sort of implicit in the fiscal 2017 free cash flow guidance is that you -- at least the way I\u2019m interpreting it is that you\u2019ll continue to burn cash in NAND. And so I guess my question is at what point do you consider a partnership to lessen the period expense and the CapEx burden associated with running this business?","Mark Durcan","We\u2019re always looking for ways to improve our relative competitive position. And we\u2019ve used partnerships and strategic relationships extensively in the past. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate that and again always with the long-term in mind. We are -- there is an embedded assumption in there. There are lots of opportunities out there today. And I think I would not try to dissuade you of that view of life. I would just caution you that we are going to be pretty careful and deliberate about making sure we take a long-term view relative to the relationships and the partnerships we engage in and we are doing something that really drives a long-term strategic benefit for the Company as opposed to a short-term fix, more supply in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","First question is I mean you could update us on the Inotera transaction, and if that were to close, if you could help us to understand the potential accretion or dilution from that transaction? And then related to it, to what extent is Inotera closing already embedded in of the financial guidance that you gave for fiscal \u201817?","Ernie Maddock","So, as we had in our prepared remarks, we do expect the transaction to close at this point, sometime in the middle of December. We did contemplate that timing in our guidance, so it doesn\u2019t really have a dramatic impact on our FQ1 guide at all. And certainly, the transaction will continue to be accretive to gross margins and continues to be accretive to free cash flow. And essentially the EPS accretion is really dependant on how we choose to finance that last billion dollar component which we don\u2019t have to make a decision on until about 30 days or so prior to closing. So, as we said before, we have the option of using equity or convert or cash or a combination of those. And so the specific EPS accretion will really be dependent upon what we finally decide for those things.","Mark Delaney","And then, a clarification on your comments that Micron will be above the CAGR that is provided for DRAM and bit growth in fiscal \u201817. I just want to clarify you would expect to be above the high end of your guidance for both the DRAM and NAND, so I mean I think it was over 30% in DRAM for fiscal \u201817 and over 40% in NAND for fiscal \u201817?","Ernie Maddock","What we said, Mark, was that we\u2019ve given these two-year CAGRs and we were slightly below for both NAND and DRAM in fiscal \u201816. So, it\u2019s reasonable to think that would be slightly above the range that we provided in fiscal \u201817, so that we over the two-year CAGR fulfill the commitment that we made around those bit growth CAGRs. So yes that\u2019s a reasonable thing to assume.","Mark Delaney","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you. I had two. Ernie, I am still little confused on the guidance. If I try to adjust for the changes in the reporting, it sounds like you are excluding about $150 million per quarter now. So on an apples to apples basis, the guidance is actually like $0.13 or something like that lower than what the headline number is or more like $0.04 at the midpoint; am I not thinking about that right?","Ernie Maddock","Yes. That\u2019s a reasonable way to think about it. Sure, Tim.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. And then, I guess that leads me to the question about OpEx because it seems like some of that\u2019s related to OpEx. So, I guess if you add the stock comp back and you assume that\u2019s mostly OpEx, you are guiding to like 650 to 700, but it sounds like maybe 80 million of that is really one-time in nature; so, maybe the baseline is more like 600 million going into next quarter, is that -- sorry going into the fiscal Q2, is that the right run rate headed into the January quarter?","Ernie Maddock","So, let me sort of try to frame that for you a little bit. We had a couple of things that are impacting this quarter\u2019s OpEx. The first was that about 25 million, give or take, are pre-qual expenses that we\u2019ve planned to spend in FQ4 are appearing in FQ1. And then secondly, we have -- we had even prior to this rollover, the highest point of pre-qual expenses for the entire fiscal year was actually occurring in Q1, plus we have the resumption of variable compensation given the new pricing environment. And so what we\u2019ve tried to frame for folks is sequentially between the variable comp being reinstated, as well as the pre-qual expenses, that\u2019s a sequential increase of about $80 million from FQ4 to FQ1, so that predominately explains the change to the OpEx. And then certainly we\u2019re hopeful that the variable compensation piece continues, because we\u2019re hopeful that the business environment is favorable. And we would expect pre-qual expenses to moderate such that we should be in that range of 600 plus or minus, so probably midpoint around 600, a few quarters, maybe couple of quarters higher, couple of quarters a little bit lower under the new framework for reporting OpEx. So, those numbers would still exclude stock-based comp, but you would expect to see a pretty meaningful moderation of OpEx as we go forward throughout the year as a result of this pre-qual situation being resolved from the rollover.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Ian Ing","Yes, thank you. Congrats on the guidance. DRAM question here, you\u2019ve got favorable contract pricing; you didn\u2019t quite get the bit output acceleration in Q4. Just wanted to understand that a bit and are there any shortages in terms of meeting customer demand at this point?","Ernie Maddock","I think part of the explanation of Q4 bit growth being slightly below, I think what we previously talked about was in fact that as we watched the market evolve we made some choices around where we\u2019d like that output to be. And the result is that our Q1 -- fiscal Q1 bit output is now going to be higher than what we had expected it to be. So, obviously that did play into our thinking as we saw market evolve. Relative to specific shortages, I\u2019m not aware of any. I don\u2019t know Mark if you are. But certainly, all of our customers are being very attentive to making sure that their supply needs are taking care of. And we are seeing certain segments and certain customers where the possibility of allocation is present.","Mark Durcan","I don\u2019t think we want to call this out today on this call, but there is certainly that risk.","Ian Ing","Okay, thanks. And for my follow-up here, server as a percent of DRAM that is down sequentially and August is -- what\u2019s happening here, perhaps enterprise is offsetting the cloud? And shouldn\u2019t this be a pretty attractive market to serve? I think pricing and server typically tracks PCs with a little bit of lag.","Mark Durcan","Yes. I think it will reaccelerate relatively quickly. It has been a little bit more of a lumpy business here over the last year or so, but we like the trends there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Rajvindra Gill","Yes. Thanks and congrats on good execution. Just a question on the inventory increase on a year-over-year basis relative to the revenue increase year-over-year based on your guidance. So, it seems like that the inventory is increasing at a faster clip than revenue. So, just wanted to get a sense in terms of any concerns you see there? So, is inventory outgrowing revenue on a year-over-year basis?","Ernie Maddock","I think you have a couple of things. First, as we\u2019ve talked about in the last quarter or so, as we\u2019re ramping on the new technologies and predominantly because of these delayed mobile calls, we had some inventory built up that is now flowing through. However, we absolutely still continue to get more-and-more output from the factory and it\u2019s going to be a couple of quarters before that inventory actually starts to decline, but we have a very clear view of an ability to decrease inventory meaningfully over the course of fiscal \u201817. I\u2019d also remind you that we are also building supply chains for SSDs and MCPs which take longer in terms of their aggregate end-to-end cycle time than selling components. So, we have that effect as well. That will cap out here in the next quarter or so and then you\u2019ll see normalization and a flow through of that as well. So, we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re cognizant of the inventory position, we\u2019d like to think that we anticipated that and share that with you. And we\u2019re equally confident that the inventory will decline nearly every quarter in fiscal \u201817.","Mark Durcan","Yes. To be honest, we feel pretty good about where we sit, given the trends in the marketplace as well. And we don\u2019t feel quite as much urgency as we might under different market conditions.","Rajvindra Gill","And just last question from me on the cash flow, and obviously you can\u2019t talk little bit about fiscal year \u201817. But if you kind of take your CapEx guidance and your depreciation add back, it does seem like it still will be kind of difficult to generate a meaningful free cash flow next year, assuming a fairly big ramp in gross margins and revenue, gross margins maybe to continue to increase above and beyond what you\u2019re guiding for November. So, I just wanted to get a sense of how you\u2019re looking at free cash flow. And Inotera agreement, how much free cash flow does that add to the Company, add that back on?","Ernie Maddock","On average, the Inotera transaction is going to add somewhere between $300 million and $600 million of cash flow on a free cash flow basis, but I\u2019d really trust that that\u2019s an average amount which would be sort of the free cash flow net of the incremental depreciation -- I\u2019m sorry, the incremental CapEx. But I think that the best way I could -- the guys are thinking there is that we\u2019ve prepared pretty conservative plan and we have a free cash flow neutral position in the context of that conservative plan. Obviously Q4 is a little bit stronger; it\u2019s fair to say that Q1 was a little bit stronger as we look at it now versus our conservative plan. And so, we would expect to be able to accumulate cash over the course of 2017 if in fact this current market environment continues. Anytime we use words like significant, it gets hard to determine what\u2019s significant to you or significant to me, but trust me every dollar is significant to us. And so, we\u2019re being very careful and monitoring that very carefully.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","NAND cost per bit was actually up slightly in Q4. Was this mix related? Maybe you could just tell us what cost per bit declines were on a like for like basis? And should we anticipate an acceleration of cost per bit starting here in the first quarter especially I think as you mentioned you get 3D bit crossover over 2D? But it seems like to me as gross margins for NAND should be inflecting up here in Q1 but I\u2019m trying to get a sense for that.","Mark Durcan","A lot of moving pieces, Harlan; I think just to get to the crux of your question, yes, you should anticipate cost per bit start coming down nicely with the 3D ramp as we start flushing those wafers through the backend and out in the marketplace. Costs are coming down nicely this quarter and we continue roadmap ahead for that as we move through the year.","Ernie Maddock","Yes. And we\u2019ve provided a cost per bit reduction forecast for the year to you. And I everything Mark said is absolutely true and counterbalancing that just a bit is this supply chain build up that I talked about because as MCPs and those SSDs have a higher COGS component, theoretically, they\u2019re also generating more margin but if we\u2019re only looking at the cost perspective, that will have a tendency to dampen the cost for bit reduction because the mix has changed.","Harlan Sur","Great, thanks for the insights there. And then, on the 1X DRAM ramp that you highlighted in your slides, when does that ramp actually commence; is it end of this year, beginning of next calendar year? And you\u2019ve mentioned also that you expect significant output by middle of next year and maybe you can just be more specific on when you expect bit cost over 1X versus 20-nanometer. Thank you.","Mark Durcan","So, we have -- we actually have wafers in manufacturing fabs in both Hiroshima and Taiwan that are yielding. The output today is insignificant. We\u2019ll continue to run engineering pilot line lots. And by the time we get to the middle of next year, you should see the significant terms of our overall output. I think probably got to wait another quarter before we give you little bit more precision on what the -- when the bit crossover might be.","Harlan Sur","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Just two questions from me, just following on that prior question regarding NAND cost per bits and all the mix issues. Can you just take that one step forward and talk about maybe how the storage business unit starts to recover in terms of profitability; is there a path to turning profitable this fiscal year? And then secondly, can you just talk about seasonality this year maybe versus last year in terms of what kind of unit shipments you\u2019re seeing versus content shipments from some of your core markets and whether it\u2019s stronger or weaker than a year ago? Thanks.","Ernie Maddock","So, let me address the question about the storage business. We are certainly hopeful that we can exit the year at least with a profitable note for the storage business. I think it\u2019s dependent on a few things. Obviously we\u2019re in the middle of a very significant portfolio sort of change out and we have to execute on those. So, far our record has been good with respect to the client and consumer segments, but we have some big product launches with respect to both data center and enterprise coming up here toward the end of this calendar year and in early calendar \u201817. And those would be really pivotal to us in completing that transition. I think that again track record has been great, the SSDs have been well-reviewed and we\u2019re very optimistic that our subsequent product launches will be equally successful. I also think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that we also are seeing the benefit of 3D in the memory -- I\u2019m sorry, in the mobile business unit as well. We saw that -- we had the mobile percentage of our NAND business this quarter move from the low teen essentially to the high teens as a result of more and more calls [ph] there and the increasing importance of the MCP portfolio. So, we are seeing the benefit of that really across multiple business units.","Mark Durcan","Let me just add to that on the seasonality question. Q4 obviously typically is a very strong quarter for NAND. Hard to know for sure but our sense is that the demand picture probably has more staying power than just the typical seasonality that you see, given the strong growth in the end applications.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Kevin Cassidy","Your guidance for first quarter is significant increase over fourth quarter. Can you give us a ranking of the end markets or the end products that are driving the increase?","Ernie Maddock","I\u2019ll take that. So, obviously as has been the case, the sort of specialty markets, the embedded markets whether it\u2019s automotive, industrial, medical probably top of the list within the computing and networking segment, graphics has been quite strong, server probably next and then followed up with mobile and client.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay. And are you seeing a significant increase with 3D NAND versus the planar NAND?","Mark Durcan","In terms of demand?","Kevin Cassidy","No, growth. I am sorry.","Mark Durcan","It\u2019s a very quickly moving dynamic right now. So, yes, we\u2019re seeing that happen sort of real time as we sell through the early production and move more and more of the products into the TLC format.","Ernie Maddock","And certainly more of that opportunity is ahead of us than it is behind us given that we\u2019re just going to hit bit crossover for 3D in this quarter. And as Mark said, we\u2019re continuing to transition, which adds cost because it suppresses output. But with more significant bit growth ahead, we expect the cost reduction opportunity to accelerate a little bit here throughout fiscal 2017.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, great. Congratulations on good results.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","I guess I want to go back to the cost side of the equation, guys. I guess just given the change in the depreciation schedule for the November quarter, I would have thought your ability to get gross margin to kind of the high 20% range especially in this pricing environment would have been fairly easy. So, I\u2019m just kind of curious as to what the offsets are in the November quarter. Is this all about the calls on mobile and if it is, what do you adjust to make that to be a hit to gross margins and when might that be done? And then, Ernie, I know you gave full year cost targets on a per bit basis, could you give the fiscal first quarter? If you did I missed them.","Mark Durcan","I think, John, actually it\u2019s really a little bit more about the lag that you typically see as pricing starts to turnaround as some of these things. Yes, there is an inventory effect relative to some of these products that we\u2019ve built up in inventory that we\u2019re early product on either 20-nanometer or 3D NAND etcetera as we sell through that\u2019s a little bit of a headwind until that\u2019s flushed out. But it\u2019s really more around as ASPs turn around, they will turn around instantaneously and they didn\u2019t turn around until end of the quarter last quarter. So remember, we had a pretty significant feed relative to the midpoint of our guidance last quarter, which gives you an indication that pricing was starting to accelerate then. It takes little while to play out and to start to [ph] do as we see these things happen. So, the trends are all in place. I think we are heading where you think where we ought to be. But it can take a little while to play out through the financials.","Ernie Maddock","Yes, and I didn\u2019t provide a cost specific cost per bit target for FQ1.","John Pitzer","Okay. And I guess as my follow-up, Mark, just on the Inotera acquisition, if you go back and look at what you guys have tried to accomplish over the last kind of seven, eight years, it\u2019s actually been to try to mitigate the cyclicality of the industry within your financials by setting up some of these JVs. Buying Inotera kind of reverses that. I am kind of curious, is this purely a financial decision on your part? You mentioned in your prepared comments that this downturn troughed at much higher levels than past downturns. So, does that give you the confidence or is there actually a fundamental reason to own the asset; will this allow you to kind of ramp 1X, or 1Y or 1Z more quickly on Inotera? If you just give a justification that would be great.","Mark Durcan","Yes. There is a lot of components to it. I think you put your finger on a piece of it which is the volatility in this business I think we can conclude is going to be less going forward. This certainly seems to have been born out as we move through this last cycle. It doesn\u2019t mean that cycles are gone, it just means that the volatility is less. So that is less of a defensive driver, so to speak.","An important thing for us in this whole picture is operational flexibility and control. As we think about our ability to drive new technologies, either in the manufacturing or to transition technologies with the Inotera assets, how the ownership of that asset and the ability to mix and match different technologies as well as potentially more value add products and capture that value is significant. Notwithstanding the fact we have a good operating relationship with Inotera, we believe that there is more value we can bring as sole owners than as board members and operational partners. And at the end of the day, it gives us the ability as well to take cash flow that\u2019s going to be generated with Inotera and to put it across our network where we find that most useful. So number of different factors play into it, all of which I think point in direction that we are moving.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Ernie, just going back to your CapEx for the next fiscal year, it sounds like you are incrementally more confident with the Inotera deal. And in that context, how should we think about the incremental CapEx requirement for Inotera? In the context of your comment that in Inotera would help with free cash accretion, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile everything. And I have a follow-up.","Ernie Maddock","So, when we provided that CapEx guidance of essentially midpoint of 5 billion net of partner contributions, we did say it included contemplated investments from Inotera. So, that\u2019s an all-in number. And as you know, we don\u2019t break out specific CapEx by fab. So, we don\u2019t plan to start doing that now. But that 5 billion midpoint with a little range around that is inclusive of anticipated investments at Inotera.","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. Thanks for clarification. And then, with the 3D NAND and the crossover with 3D NAND, should I assume that all the 3D NAND capacity coming on line is TLC or is this clearly MLC left in the mix?","Ernie Maddock","No. The first out 3D was MLC but we very quickly introduced TLC. And as we said in our prepared remarks, most of our client consumer SSDs are now out on TLC and we\u2019re qualifying the TLC into some mobile applications as well and we will be majority TLC by the middle of fiscal \u201817 here as we go forward. So that\u2019s part of the engine of the significant bit growth that we\u2019ve contemplated and forecast.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the decision to move to seven-year depreciable life on DRAM. I guess that strikes me as a long time. And I look at your CapEx ratio, PP&E sort of a third. What was the thinking my seven years and can you remind us the depreciation life of the NAND equipment?","Ernie Maddock","So, the depreciation life of the NAND equipment is about five years. And really, we conducted quite an extensive study around how long the technology transitions existed or took in the DRAM world, how long they were contemplated to take on a going forward basis, we looked at the practices of others, both competitors and partners. But really the substance of the decision was related to what we anticipate and what we\u2019ve been saying for some time is a sort of slowing of the technology transitions and therefore the longer useability of that equipment as the technology transition times change. And the reality is there is a range of answers you come up with when you do a study like that. And much like the midpoint of guided range in seven years felt to us like it was not overly aggressive, but not overly conservative either. So, you could assume that we could have gone a year or two on either side of that and we chose a position that we thought was reasonable given what we know and understand about the pace of technology transition.","Joe Moore","Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then as a follow-up, have you given or can you give an absolute number for depreciation for either the quarter or for the fiscal year?","Ernie Maddock","We expect depreciation to be somewhere in the range of $4 billion for the year give or take.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you very much.","Ernie Maddock","And operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Ernie, are you noting that you might be able to generate cash over the next few quarters? Can you give us any idea what you would do with any net cash generated; would you be able to pay down debt or other uses of cash?","Ernie Maddock","Certainly, first thing we\u2019re going to be focused on is actually accumulating the cash. So, that\u2019s my first priority because I have to have some of it to be able to decide what to do with it. And certainly at that point in time, we would certainly look at the opportunities that were available to delver and we would look at those in the context of everything else that\u2019s going around. And it\u2019s really impossible to say specifically what we would decide to do in the context of a future that\u2019s not yet here. But I can tell you that delevering is an important priority. And depending on how much cash we generate, we may choose to deploy a 100 million of that or so back into CapEx, if that\u2019s the right decision, but delevering is certainly nearest and dearest to our hearts at the moment.","Operator","Thank you.

I'll now turn the call over to Mark Durcan.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.35 billion with gross margins of 25%, non-GAAP net income of $249 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.24, all within our guided range. In addition, our non-GAAP operating income was 246 million and our operating cash flow was $1.1 billion. Our results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC DRAM segment. In addition, pricing pressure was also present in the client SSD and certain eMCP segments. As for Micron's execution, we are on-track with the qualification of several new technologies, including 20-nanometer DDR4 and low-power DDR4, as well as our 3D NAND products. These products and technology transitions can be disruptive to the manufacturing environment in the short-term, but we believe they will pay dividends going forward as our product portfolio will be better positioned to address market demand. While current market conditions and our financial results have been challenging, we remain confident and we're focused on deploying our advanced technology in order to drive enhanced operational leverage for the Company.","Taken together expected market conditions and new product qualifications will continue to create challenges in the near-term. However, we still expect to see stronger bit growth and cost reductions commencing in the second half of fiscal 2016. These advancements in our technology deployment, as well as our new system level solution products we're developing and deploying will improve our long-term competitive position and drive enhanced financial results.","Reflecting on market conditions, we believe that DRAM industry bit supply growth will be in a low 20% range in 2016, in line with demand and that industry fundamentals will remain healthy over the long-term. Demand continues to diversify driven by the mobile cloud server and embedded segments, which together balance maturing PC demand. The DRAM industry consist of only three technology developers, based on current long-term outlook we foresee technology driven supply growth slowing and can envision a future in which no additional DRAM wafer capacity is required.","Turning to the NAND market, as I noted earlier, we've seen price competition in client SSDs and eMCPs during our first fiscal quarter. While we expect some of these trends to continue into fiscal Q2, we've also seen some positive signs in other segments and will continue to monitor market conditions carefully.","Industry-wide, we see relatively muted NAND supply growth in 2016 as planar fabs are converted to 3D, creating short-term headwinds to supply. We estimate industry bit supply growth in the mid-30% range, which is likely below the long-term demand trend. As the cost advantage of large scale 3D NAND deployment is realized, we expect solid-state drives will see accelerated adoption in the client, datacenter and enterprise segments. This adoption combined with higher densities, should form the basis of a healthy long-term demand environment. These trends will likely be complemented by density growth in mobile devices.","Beyond 2016, we believe that the longer term NAND demand trend should lead to additional industry capacity, including our own Fab 10X expansion in Singapore. Construction for this facility is on-track and we currently expect to ramp into it starting in the second half of calendar 2016. Our capacity ramp will be driven by market conditions and expected ROIC.","Micron has focused on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products. Specifically in 2016, this focus is on three key areas, ramping 20-nanometer DRAM and enabling 1X DRAM in manufacturing, ramping 3D NAND and enabling second generation 3D NAND in manufacturing, and finally accelerating the development of advanced controllers to enable growth in SSDs and other system-level solutions.","In terms of bit growth, for DRAM, we still expect Micron to be above the market for calendar year 2016, based on a market growth assumption in the low-20% range. The majority of Micron's growth will occur in the latter half of fiscal 2016, with continued progress in fiscal year 2017. For trade NAND, we expect our bit growth to be below the market in calendar 2016, as we proceed with 3D conversions which will limit output in the first half of the year. Our Fab 10X expansion and 3D conversions position us to significantly outgrow the NAND market in fiscal 2017.","Turning to Inotera, as you heard us announce last week, we entered into agreements for Micron to acquire the remaining outstanding equity of Inotera. We believe this a compelling combination for the companies, our shareholders, our customers and our employees. Micron has a solid history of integrating memory assets and we believe this acquisition will prove to be successful.","Separately, we've also entered into an agreement granting Nanya an option to license to future DRAM technology nodes in exchange for a royalty and equity arrangement. These agreements form the basis for a continuous strategic partnership with Nanya and the Formosa Group. I'll turn the call over to Mark Adams now, who will summarize our operational and business unit results. Ernie Maddock will then cover Q1 financials and I'll conclude with a couple of thoughts prior to Q&A. Mark?","Mark Adams","Thank you, Mark. I will begin by reviewing our DRAM and Non-Volatile businesses, followed by an update on each of our four business units. And close with commentary on our operations and technology deployment activities.","Let's begin with DRAM, which represented 58% of our total revenue in fiscal Q1. While PC DRAM average selling prices remained under pressure, we saw more stable pricing in our other market segments, where demand remained relatively healthy. We continue to ramp 20-nanometer DRAM technology and move production to DDR4 and LPDDR4 to meet customer demand.","As a percentage of DRAM revenue in fiscal Q1, mobile was in a low-30% range similar to Q4. The PC segment was in the mid-20% range, up slightly from prior quarter. The server business was in the high-teens percent range from the low-20% last quarter. And especially, DRAM which includes networking, graphics, automotive and other embedded technologies was in the low-20%, similar to last quarter.","In our Non-Volatile Memory business, trade revenue represents 34% of total revenue in fiscal Q1. Performance was consistent with our expectations making early progress on our 3D RAM and customer qualifications. As a percentage of trade, Non-Volatile Memory revenue in fiscal Q1, consumer which includes our memory cards, USB and components was approximately 50% up from mid-40s in Q4. Mobile including MCPs was in the high-teens percent range from low-20s last quarter. SSDs were in the mid-teens percent range similar to last quarter and Automotive and Industrial Multimarket segment or AIM and other embedded applications were in the mid-teens percent range similar to Q4.","Moving on to our business units, Micron's Compute and Networking business unit posted fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.14 billion down 12% from the prior quarter with non-GAAP operating income of $21 million or 2% of revenue. CMBU was impacted by lower average selling prices driven by continued softness in demand from the PC segment. While we anticipate this demand to remain relatively soft in Q2, we're encouraged by growth opportunities in other areas of the market, including enterprise and cloud segments and remain focused on optimizing our product mix in fast growing high-value segments.","On the technology front, we successfully executed go-to-market activity on our 20-nanometer DDR3, our GDDR5 and 8 gigabyte DDR4 products. Our Enterprise and Cloud segment saw strong growth for our DDR4 products driven by increased cloud demand from several of our hyper-scale customers. We're making good progress deploying our 20-nanometer 8 gigabyte components which will drive future cost improvements.","Looking forward, we anticipate year-over-year bit growth of 40-plus percent driven by increased memory requirements to support virtualization and real-time analytic workloads. Our DDR4 portfolio and innovative Non-Volatile DIMM products have us well-positioned to benefit from these strong growth trends in the future.","The graphic card segment experienced softness in demand as customers rebalanced inventory levels of GDDR5 early in the quarter. We anticipate demand to increase returning to normal levels within the current quarter. We continue to successfully ramp our 20-nanometer 8 gigabyte GDDR5 with a substantial increase in shipments during fiscal Q1 and we are well-positioned to capitalize on growth in system DRAM content in the future.","The Networking segment was impacted by seasonal weakness in demand and the delay of China LTE build-out. However, market feedback suggests that demand should regain momentum in the coming months. In Q1, we doubled DDR4 shipments quarter-over-quarter in our networking segment.","In the Client PC segment, we shipped our first 8 gigabyte DDR4 samples to major OEM customers and are well-positioned for mass production later this quarter. Looking forward as PC form factors continue to evolve, Micron's broad offering in DDR3, DDR4, and low-power DRAM will enable us to meet the changing needs of this market and deliver greater value.","Micron Stores Business Unit posted fiscal Q1 revenue of $884 million, up 4% versus the prior quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $27 million or negative 3%. We maintain relatively stable average selling prices in our Stores business for the fourth consecutive quarter. SBU continues to focus on optimizing our product portfolio to mitigate transactional market exposure, while serving higher value segments.","Our 3D vertical NAND technology has three times the density of existing planner solutions. We are actively sampling and developing our own SSD product portfolio based upon through an 384 gigabyte 3D TLC and 256 gigabyte 3D MLC NAND, and expect to make products available for broad marketplace adoption in the second half of fiscal year 2016.","In the Components segment, we delivered our first 3D NAND dye to the market in Q1, shipping 256 gigabyte MLC 3D NAND components to nearly 20 third-party USB and consumer SSD manufacturers. Shipments to additional customers are continuing this quarter.","Client and Consumer SSDs bit growth increased by double-digits sequentially as decreasing SSD prices continues to accelerate adoption in OEM Ultrabook and Ultrathin PCs, as well as consumer upgrades. Lower density consumer SSD will continue to narrow the cost gigabyte parity gap with hard drives, increasing their attractiveness.","Our Enterprise business saw quarter-over-quarter demand growth with strong OEM component sales growing 47% sequentially. Enterprise SSD revenue was up 13% sequentially driven by market pull for enterprise server, cloud storage and flash array solutions.","We began sampling our new S600 Series of SaaS-based SSDs in fiscal Q1, having qualified these drives with OEM customers and engaging in qualifications with numerous end-users and channel integrators. This SSD series is the first product family developed as part of Micron's strategic agreement with Seagate combining flash innovation and SaaS expertise from both companies. These drives are scheduled to begin shipping commercially in the first half of the fiscal year.","Datacenter SSD bit shipments were down quarter-over-quarter amid competitive price pressure. Despite the market competitiveness in enhances datacenter SSD segment, we received orders for M500 DC and M510 SATA-based SSDs from multiple hyper-scaling customers and cloud customers, and continue to ramp these encryption enhanced SSDs with end-users who require enterprise-level data encryption in end-markets such as medical, banking and government.","Micron's mobile unit posted fiscal Q1 revenue of 834 million down 13% versus the prior quarter, due to lower volumes and pricing pressure from the eMCP market. Non-GAAP operating income was 136 million or 16% down from Q4 reflecting the higher cost of 20-nanometer product during the early ramp.","Micron\u2019s Mobile business unit continues to benefit from the evolving mobile systems architectures that steadily increase memory density requirements at all private levels. Demand in the quarter moved toward the high-end and value segments, both of which continued to show rapid growth in memory content. We started to see seasonally soft demand in line with our expectations towards the end of the quarter, which we expect to continue through fiscal Q2.","Bit shipments of eMCP were down 14% driven by relative softness in the mid-range handset market in China. We are encouraged by strengthening sign in the higher value markets. Demand remains strong for discreet on package low power DDR4 and higher density eMCPs. We will be completing a number of LP4 20-nanometer Tier 1 OEM qualification this quarter and expect LP4 volume to surpass LP3 by fiscal Q3.","The Embedded business unit posted fiscal Q1 revenues of 479 million, slightly up from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 24%, which is a 2% improvement from the previous quarter, driven by better overall cost and growth in the Automotive segment. Automotive revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year. These results were driven by solid growth in DRAM and eMMC in applications that include Infotainment, Instrument Cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We recently announced our XTRMFlash a new NOR flash solution with an auto sequential interface that boats industry-leading reading throughputs with ultra fabs and random access times. We also continue to make good progress in next-generation design wins with key automotive customers in Europe and in Asia.","Following a strong fiscal Q4 2015, our Industrial and Multimarket business declined primarily due to reductions in NOR volumes. We lost our first SSTD M500IT targeted for industrial customers in the quarter and we are making positive strides with DDR4 validations and low-power DRAM design wins. Our Consumer and Connected Home revenue increased 10% quarter-over-quarter with significant increases in unit volume demand for DRAM partially offset by pricing declines.","We anticipate continued share increases in DRAM. Our MCPs, NOR, EMLC, SPI NAND and high-endurance eMMCs provide a strong baseline portfolio, in addition to DRAM and low-power DRAM products in the Consumer and Connected Home market. Key trends include the growth of wearables, cloud-based DDR and instant on applications, including graphical man-to-man interfaces and multifunction printers and home automation products.","I would like to close with a few updates on our operations and technology deployment activities. As is evidenced from my comment about prior design wins and qualifications, Micron remains on-track to our conversion plan and yield targets for both the 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND technologies. We continue to expect, 20-nanometer to represent more than half of our DRAM output in the May quarter. And 3D NAND is on-track to be a majority of our NAND output by the end of the calendar 2016.","Our 1X DRAM and GEN 2 3D NAND technologies are also progressing well in R&D and we are focused on transferring the technology to production fabs before the end of fiscal 2016 for the production ramp beginning in fiscal 2017. We are also very excited about the opportunity to simplify our operations and business model, as a result of the announced acquisition of Inotera. The fab will be 100% converted to our 20-nanometer technology by the time we expect to close the deal in mid-2016, hoping to drive significant cost reductions for Micron thereafter. In addition, we will increase our flexibility to drive capital investment decisions, as well as product and technology mix going forward.","Now to continue our commentary on Q1 results and Q2 guidance, I will turn the call over to Ernie.","Ernie Maddock","Thanks Mark. Consistent with the direction that we shared last quarter commentary around the P&L will focus on our non-GAAP results. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation slides posted on our Web site. As Mark Durcan noted earlier, revenue for the first quarter was $3.35 billion coming in at the low-end of our guided range. Overall, our revenues were impacted by declining pricing particularly in the PC DRAM segment, partially offset by volume increases in both the DRAM and Non-Volatile Trade segments.","Gross margin ended the quarter at 25.3%, consistent with our guidance and non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $249 million or $0.24 per share, slightly above the midpoint of our guided range. During the quarter, we benefited from a better than anticipated tax provision, as well as favorable results from our equity method investments offset by lower than expected operating income. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together these two items represent an additional $0.04 per share for the recently completed quarter.","Now let's look at the results by product line. DRAM revenue decreased approximately 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of lower average selling prices. During the quarter, we saw further market adoption of DDR4 DRAM products, in both mobile and non-mobile segments. DRAM gross margin was in the upper-20% range, lower than our previous quarter as a result of decreases in average selling prices that outpaced decreases in per bit costs.","Our Non-Volatile Trade revenue decreased slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to decreased average selling price that outpaced increases in sales volume. Gross margin remained relatively flat in the low-20% range as decreases in per bit cost to offset selling price changes. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at approximately 600 million in line with the midpoint of our guided range. The Company generated operating cash flow of approximately 1.1 billion during the first quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.4 billion.","Expenditures for PP&E in the first quarter were $1 billion and we continue to expect fiscal 2016 capital expenditures in the $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion range with expected third-party contributions of between $300 million and $800 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 57 million in face value of convertible notes for $94 million and approximately 7 million shares of our common stock for 126 million.","Moving now to our second fiscal quarter guidance on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following. Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 17.5% to 20%, operating expenses between $565 million and $620 million, operating income ranging between a loss of $20 million and a income of 20 million, I'm sorry, operating income ranging between a loss of $60 million and income of $20 million and an EPS range between a loss of $0.12 per share and a loss of $0.05 per share based on 1.30 billion diluted shares.","As we've discussed on the call we intend to acquire the remaining interest in Inotera not owned by Micron. This transaction will result in the full consolidation of Inotera into Micron's financial statements after closing of the acquisition, which is expected to occur mid-calendar year 2016. I'd like to spend a few moments reviewing key aspects of this important transaction. First, we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive at closing. Second, and equally important we expect to generate significant incremental operating cash flow. As a point of reference, under the margin sharing structure which commences at the beginning of calendar 2016, we would expect to realize approximately 25% of the total operating cash flow associated with the output from Inotera. After closing, we will receive the full benefit of this cash flow. Over the last 12 months this would have generated an approximate $1.4 billion of incremental operating cash flow for the Company.","Finally, we expect future cash flows from the Inotera output to be well above the capital expenditures required to fund their technology advancements. Based on current market conditions Inotera's operations should on average generate north of $600 million of incremental free cash flow for a year for Micron. Micron plans to fund the acquisition of the remaining Inotera interest with approximately $2.5 billion of debt sourced in Taiwan at an expected interest rate of around 3%. In addition, we have the option to finance up to $1 billion worth with Micron stock sold to Nanya and we will fund the remaining $500 million with cash from our balance sheet.","Separately, we've entered into agreements granting Nanya an option to licensee two future DRAM technology nodes continuing our strategic relationship. These license agreements may generate a future royalty stream for Micron in addition to a smaller equity ownership in Nanya with timing dependent on the technology deployment. At the earliest, we would expect these benefits to commence in calendar 2017. The license is non-transferrable, limited to a specific capacity footprint and terminates on change of control of Nanya.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Mark Durcan.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Ernie. As many of you know Kipp Bedard will be transferring out of the Investor Relations leadership role over the next few weeks. So, I wanted to take just a minute today to thank him for all his contributions to the team over the last 32 years. Kipp has not only been a great leader of Investor Relations for Micron, but a selfless team member, whose contributions internally through the years rivaled his well-recognized excellence externally. I've always been able to count on Kipp, Kipp's honesty and thoughtful input on all manner of issues facing the Company, and in good times and bad he is and always has been all about Micron and the team. I think it's fair to say that Micron would not be the Company it used to be without Kipp. So, we will truly miss our good friend.","Kipp Bedard","Mark thank you very much for the kind words. It's been my honor and privilege to represent you and the entire Micron team into the public markets over the past three decades. For that opportunity and experience I am truly grateful. Thank you all for a very exciting and fulfilling career.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Kipp. Let me finish on this topic by saying, we're very fortunate to have a very capable Ivan Donaldson in-house and ready to step into the lead IR role. I think most on the call already know Ivan and then he too has a thorough understanding of the Company, the industry along with the skills to excel in this role. I certainly expect that if he steps in, he will hit the ground running and thought Kipp is leaving behind some very big shoes to fill, Ivan's preparation and dedication, make him an easy choice for this role.","To summarize our call today, we're in the midst of some challenging market conditions but we remain confident in the long-term health of the industry and in our strategy to succeed. This confidence drives our long-term investment perspective and we expect to see stronger bit growth and cost reductions starting in the second half of the year. Operationally, we're laser focused on execution related to the deployment of leading-edge DRAM and 3D NAND, as well as advanced controller development.","Operator we're ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your question please.","Kevin Cassidy","Gross margins coming down again quarter-over-quarter even with -- you just point to transition to 20-nanometer and DDR4, I guess if you could help us with some of the moving parts on the gross margins for those products, the 20-nanometer, how much lower costs are you expecting as that becomes 100% of the Inotera output and also what is DDR4 versus DDR3 cost and gross margins?","Mark Durcan","So, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that, although Inotera's output will be, the wafer starts will be about 80% by year-end it takes a while to sort of move those through the overall system and deliver them into the marketplace and so you wouldn't get the full benefit of that 20-nanometer cost reduction as we move into our fiscal Q2. And in terms of other overall factors there was clearly continued pressure on PC DRAM and as we have talked about for some time, 20-nanometer doesn't get you to lower cost immediately whether from Inotera or out of any other fab as a result of startup costs and getting those ramps to scale. And then finally, DDR4 cost which is getting to be an increasingly important part of the mix are clearly a little bit higher than DDR3 and that creates some pressure as well. So those are the general characteristics of the margin trends there.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay. And just as a follow-up also on NAND flash, there was a conversion to TLC or can you say what percentage of your output was TLC versus MLC and is that expected to help gross margins going forward?","Mark Durcan","Our TLC output is about 10% plus or minus. We have more capabilities for upside volume if we so chose, that portion of the market has been super-competitive both in components and in TLC-based client center SSDs. So we've moved some of our capacity that we initially targeted TLC toward some higher value sockets, which really allowed us to insulate against pricing pressure although a bit better than the market.","Mark Adams","I think longer term it's fair to say that as we ramp 3D, we would expect that penetration to begin to increase again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Harlan Sur","Assuming another year of relatively muted demand trends in DRAM in 2016, does it make sense to accelerate your move to 1X DRAM technology to drive acceleration in your cost curve and I guess the same question on potentially accelerating the move to TLC and 3D NAND transitions within your NAND business because it just seems like the team is continuously fighting this uphill battle on the cost front?","Mark Durcan","Yes, you know we have said for some time that really it's absolutely imperative that we not necessarily have an identical technology profile to others in the market, but certainly narrow the gap relative to the deployed advanced technology, that enables a couple of things, one is it make sure that we have timely introduction of the right products for our customers. But additionally, it makes sure that we don't have a situation in the marketplace that competitors can take advantage of and drive increased market share due to a different profile relative to manufacturing efficiency. So, yes we think it's strategically important that we narrow this gap; we're focused on it and we believe that with demand growth that we see in the marketplace it can absorb that incremental capacity as we make those transitions, as long as others in the marketplace don't add too many incremental new wafers.","Harlan Sur","Okay, thanks for that. And then a better mix of enterprise and datacenter SSD I think would drive the nice offset to the price aggressiveness you're currently seeing on the client side, so if you could just give us an update on your enterprise SSD progress, you know you talked about rolling out your datacenter M500 Series, you also talked about rolling out your 600 Series with Seagate, how big is enterprise flash as a percent of your total NAND business? And can you just give us any view on that growth outlook for enterprise looking into the calendar year 2016?","Mark Durcan","Well, let me try to set the baseline from where we sit today. Enterprise is relatively small, but the growth trajectory is pretty big. The 3 areas of investment we\u2019re driving today are continued focus on enterprise-level controller and firmware, obviously driving the Seagate product line to market in the SaaS category. And we're also investing very heavily in 3D NAND drives for enterprise which we will be sampling soon. The final piece for us is I mentioned briefly in my comments, our components that we market to other enterprise players are probably the highest margin products we have in NAND, because of the quality of NAND we manufacture. So when you combine all that out, we're pretty bullish about enterprise going forward and we will continue to invest as such.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest. Your question please.","Monika Garg","I just want to delve deeper into the margin guidance for next quarter, the gross margins are guided like 600 to 700 bps lower Q-over-Q, maybe could you walk on in details, is it mainly on the DRAM side of the margins are going lower or in the NAND side?","Mark Durcan","I would say it's more oriented on the DRAM side for all the reasons we've talked about on the course of the call. We expect NAND to be relatively similar to what we're seeing this quarter maybe a little bit sequentially lower, but it\u2019s DRAM is where the most significant movement is.","Monika Garg","And then the DRAM is it mainly PC side or are you seeing that going -- now moving into mobile and server as well?","Mark Durcan","There is a continued performance and as you might imagine if you look at things that are closest to PCs that in the enterprise space maybe some of the cost basis that look a little bit more like PCs those maybe subject to some increasing price pressure as well. If you go to the mobile side which is a little bit more specialized that tends to be buffered somewhat, but generally speaking as we talked about on the call, you see pressure throughout that whole sector.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","John Pitzer","Ernie, I guess, from my perspective let's go back to the gross margin guidance for the February quarter, I think you did a good job, kind of talking about the puts and takes, do you think that the February quarter kind of represents the maximum quarter of pain on the cost side and has improved there and can you help me to understand as you look at 30-nanometer\/25-nanometer DDR3 to 20-nanometer DDR4 at equivalent yield what's the cost down you would expect in that transition?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, so I do think from a cost perspective that we've been talking for sometime about the fact that the first couple of quarters of this fiscal year were going to be the most challenging for us as we got everything lined up relative to 20-nanometer and also on the NAND side. So I think that -- without certainly providing guidance beyond Q2, I would say our expectation is that with increased bits out we're going to see cost down that will be very helpful to us in the back half for the year. DDR4 has a bigger dye size than DDR3 but the shrink gets you closer to parity and also the production of 8 gig is also a big cost driver. So, it's really hard to say specifically but you are certainly in the same zip-code based on that comparison.","John Pitzer","That's helpful, guys, and then Mark, maybe as my follow-on relative to the implied guidance for February, it doesn't look like Inotera would be accretive on February numbers and maybe Ernie answered the question already, is the expectation by the time the Inotera acquisition closes that some of these cost headwinds will become tailwinds and hence this is an accretive acquisition or can you help me walk through kind of that dynamic?","Mark Durcan","Yes, I think, and maybe Ernie wants to comment on this too, John but, yes I think the key point is that as we get a little further into the year that 20-nanometer transition is driving some pretty significant improvements at Inotera and we expect it to be quite accretive to us right out of the chute once we close.","Ernie Maddock","Yes, and the only thing I'd add to that is that the bulk of the CapEx spend for their \u201916 will already be completed. So, certainly from a cash flow perspective there is a lot of leverage there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir from Ladenburg. Your question please.","Daniel Amir","A couple of questions here with regards to the eMCP and the client SSD, looks like those were areas of thereabout weakness here this quarter, can you give a bit more clarity kind of where we stand at this point in the quarter and specifically the eMCP given that bit shipments were down 14%, I mean in this scenario that you're going to still be focusing on as well? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Sure, on the eMCP category, there's really two dynamics going on one of which is some market softness in mobile which we identified earlier in my comments. The second piece is that as is consist with some other DRAM segments, the 20-nanometer transition puts us in a position where this was heavy focused on qualifying at major OEM customers. Having said that, there is also one area of mix issues that relates to the high-end and the low-end doing better than the mid-range segment of the market, so combine all those three together and there is some pressure on eMCP demand, we are continuing to feel that as a place for our product's focus, but again weighing that against mix and other opportunities.","Daniel Amir","And the client SSD side?","Mark Durcan","That for us as I mentioned earlier, we saw a very heavy competition in client SSDs driven by low cost TLC products both in the consumer and OEM market and we chose to move some of our capacity out of that market to higher value sockets and that allowed us to get kind of the most out of our capacity.","Daniel Amir","And is that a trend that you are continuing this quarter as well?","Mark Durcan","I would say that without forecasting it is something that yes we see pretty consistent quarter to-date and we would as Mark commented we are going to watch that while we position our 3D NAND TLC out longer term, because of the performance and cost advantages there. But today we see other opportunities as I said for our NAND capacity more are high performing MLC capacity that allows us to make that shift.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your question please.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Just a follow-up on those details, I was wondering if you could just sort of step back and if we look big picture around some of your comments about the PC market is a whole stabilizing. What gives you sort of confidence on that happening over next several months? And then similarly given some of the weakness you are seeing in the mid-range especially in China mobile market, again what do you think that improves as you get further into next calendar year? Thanks a lot.","Mark Durcan","Well, I not sure we sent forecast out on either one of those stated. We think that the PC market, the signs are that channel inventories are leveling off a little bit better that was after the inventory was low. If you look at more specifically to our business DRAM inventory in the channel with the exception of one player, one larger player, DRAM inventory across our channel is pretty low. So the demand seems to be flowing through and replenish of inventory seems -- that seems to be dynamic in the PC space. So that\u2019s what behind our view of the world in terms of PC shipments. If you look at the data while not stellar growth certainly better than the first half of calendar year '15.","On the mobile side, we still believe that these same dynamic goes on with smartphones, inventory is relatively low and the other side if you look at the configurations that are coming out for holiday and beyond, the memory content per unit is going out nicely in our favor. So it's all about for the mobile phone place market segment it's really all about what's the weighted average content and we still see not withstanding some of the weakness in the middle -- pretty reasonable growth in aggregate for the smartphone business.","Steven Fox","Great that\u2019s very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, similarly on just sort of the enterprise side, I think you talked a about little bit of competitiveness, you are not the only ones to talk about that on SSDs in the last couple months. Is there a reason to believe that that sort of is temporary in nature from a demand side putting aside from the supply issues?","Mark Durcan","I think overall we think yes the penetration in enterprise is so low that we think it's likely that there tends to be a better market going forward and we are going to invest as such. Some of our competitiveness comments are really more around value segment, consumer and channel SSD-type products that are really driven by kind of a cost approach and not a performance approach.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from Sterne Agee CRT. Your question please.","Doug Freedman","I guess if I -- a lot of questions have been asked on the gross margin side, but if I could get a little bit of color around the revenue. We are looking at a revenue decline quarter-on-quarter of 9% at the mid-point. What are the pieces that are driving that, I am looking at sort of the bit growth side here and just struggling to come up to see, to align your longer term bit growth outlook with what\u2019s going on in the near-term, so if you could help me understand what are the pieces to the top-line that would be helpful?","Mark Durcan","So, I don\u2019t think it's too dissimilar a story from the discussion we had about margins which is you know we've talked about the fact that for the first couple of quarters of this fiscal year our bit growth is going to be limited. Now we are growing bits however in the face of some of the pricing pressures that we\u2019ve seen in PCs, our PC DRAM space et cetera, that is not enough to overcome you know the bit growth doesn't quite overcome the pricing and that leads to the revenue circumstances as you heard both Mark and Mark speak about today in terms of those things are going to drive our bit growth in the second half of this fiscal year and into you know fiscal '17 those are still well on-track which would be the full deployment of 20-nanometer throughout the DRAM space, as well as the 3D NAND conversion.","Mark Adams","Yes Doug, let me just add you know as we, as we do this substantial ramp of 20-nanometer we have a lot of new products to qualify as well. And so getting complete certainty as to exactly when all these products are going to qualify and when we will ship that product is difficult although we have complete confidence that we will qualify them and that they will be delivered. So there is that dynamic and that aspect as well which is I mean you know associated with ramping a lot of new products simultaneously.","Doug Freedman","I guess for my follow-up if I could, a little bit of a two parter, I just want to make sure I understood, you said your DRAM bit growth would be above industry average of low-20s. Was that for the calendar year or your fiscal year? and then when I look at these transitions that you're going through like 20-nanometer it's one of the things I think investors struggle with is that your results tend to -- we're seeing a much greater oscillation at Micron in sort of the financial performance than we do in your peers over at Samsung and Arnex and yet they go through the same transitions. Why is it that we're seeing such a greater impact to the financials here than we see at your peers?","Mark Durcan","So, a two part question, I relative to the first part, yes it's a calendar reference and it's weighted in the back half of the calendar year. Although we've told you that fiscal Q3 should be a significant step up. Relative to the impact on financial performance I'm going to let Mark comment on that in just a second but I would make the, point that this just sort of reinforces why we need to accelerate the introduction of these technos, because we have fixed operating expenses and in an environment where we're generating less gross margin because we're deploying less advanced technology that takes a bigger bite out of the net picture, Mark do you want to?","Mark Adams","Yes just one other comment. We've communicated all along for many years that as a percentage of our capacity we sell and market our products in these much higher value segments, if you look at ASP per gigabit in NAND and DRAM for example, we've been a market leader in that for as long as I can remember. And when you're not in that model, meaning you're in ramp stage and you're driving these products into lower value segments the volatility and pricing will have a much bigger impact on margins during that time phase.","Ernie Maddock","So Doug, just in summary we look at all this as opportunity and certainly we think we can do better and we intend to do better.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company, your question please.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot, I had two, I guess the first question is on the Dalian announcements from Intel, I think that happened on the 20th of October so you really haven\u2019t talked publically too much since that and there's still a bit of confusion out there, I guess we understand that you're basically ramping the fab there and for long terms of purposes you're sort of operating it. So I guess my first question is do you have any rights to the output of the fab and do you have the option to invest in the fab? And then I had a follow-up, thanks.","Mark Durcan","So Tim we are not operating the fab, we're not ramping the fab, Intel is our partner and we're helping facilitate the deployment of the technology to that fab. So, that relationship remains healthy and we would expect that as Intel progresses with their ramp of the manufacturing technology there, at some point we will have more discussions about whether it makes sense for increased collaboration at that site, we're not involved today.","Timothy Arcuri","And then I guess the second question, I think John asked a question previously about cost and whether the headwinds start to weigh in after this current quarter and it sounds like they do and you should get a little bit better PC pricing environment per -- I think Mark your comments as well. So, I guess my question is, is it fair to say that the February quarter is the bottom in gross margin if you sort of assume those two factors? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Well, again we got to stay away from or we're going to stay away from projecting ASPs with, but in terms of our internal operational leverage we think things get a lot better in Q3.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question please.","Vijay Rakesh","I had a question on Inotera here, what percent of the 20-nanometer output at the Inotera is DDR3 versus DDR4 today? And at 20-nanometer also is the DDR4 cost still higher than DDR3?","Mark Durcan","I don't have the DDR3, DDR4 mix by fab and I think we want to stay away from giving you that fab specific information, anyway. I'm sorry the second part of the question was DDR4 crossover?","Vijay Rakesh","Yes, is the 20-nanometer DDR4 cost higher than DDR3?","Mark Durcan","20-nanometer DDR4 cost\u2026","Mark Adams","Yes, we commented on that a little bit earlier, not an 8 gigabit but we would expect that as we ramp-up and crossover that we will be at parity and actually see some reductions but at present it\u2019s fair to think about it as a headwind for us.","Vijay Rakesh","And on the 3D NAND side I know you mentioned second-gen 3D NAND kind of in the second half '16, is that kind of a 64 layer 3D NAND and just as a background what percent of output today is on 3D, I know you said you shipped some here?","Mark Durcan","We haven't said what our gen-2 technology looks like exactly but you can count on it being a significant improvement in both grid density and cost. And sorry the second part of the question\u2026?","Mark Adams","What percent of 3D?","Mark Durcan","Percent of 3D is it's relatively small today but ramping fairly aggressively and again as we get into the second half of next year we'll actually be into the new fab expansion as well. So, it'll really takeoff then.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Your question please.","Hans Mosesmann","A question on the 3D XPoint, can you give us a little more flavor, I forget if you actually been commented so far on the call regarding this but can you give us a sense on the ramp and is there change in the nuance of the opportunity as being used in as main memory or is it a storage?","Mark Durcan","Well I think it targets both, main memory and storage applications overtime, probably a higher value in the near memory then in, and then in the storage applications but could be targeted at both. We're really more in an enablement mode as opposed to a significant production ramp today, but we think the revenue does become significant out in 2017 and more so in 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman, Bernstein. Your question please.","Mark Newman","I wanted to ask a question again on 20-nanometer ramp, so it seems like from the comments that schedule is ramping pretty much in line with what you're saying about half of production within the May quarter, but based on this gross margin guidance again it is coming down quite a lot, it seems like the cost isn't quite performing at least not in FQ2 yet, so I am wondering is this because of poor yields than expected on 20-nanometer, is there any difference in the yields on 20-nanometer than your expectations versus previous nodes or is it just that the 20-nanometer that you're starting to produce which I assumed should be a fairly significant portion in FQ2 is really being held more in inventory and such not really impacting the top-line and the cost?","Mark Durcan","Yes there is a dynamic that as you ramp new technologies you have to get those products qualified, but they don't necessary always flow out to the customer quite as quickly, so there is an inventory dynamic that you're referencing. I think the bigger issue is that when you're ramping new technologies, it just takes awhile to get the tools ramped and loaded and get that output out and the cost reductions do come they just don't come quite as quickly as people anticipate. We're on-track or slightly ahead of where we expected to be from a yield perspective, so everything is progressing nicely there. Obviously ASPs are a lot lower than we thought they were going to be.","Mark Newman","So as we look forward to the backend of the fiscal year, so if you look forward to FQ3 the May quarter then we should see a much -- we should see some of this cost decline finally happened, I think that's probably fair to assume and can we assume that the previous guidance for the cost decline from 20-nanometer that you've guided as earlier is still intact but just more backend of the fiscal year and rather than the front-end?","Mark Durcan","Yes, I think we said for quite awhile Mark that fiscal Q3 is when you should really start to see the impact from 20-nanometer ramp and all the guidance we've given over previous quarters I think it is still on-track and intact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your question please.","Ian Ing","Yes, thanks, could you talk about your assumptions on keeping mobile DRAM in supply demand balance this next year, I mean, there is a lot of unit variability at the big OEMs that given how that plays out, would you ever consider not to trying to over shift the industry?","Mark Durcan","Well certainly look at that dynamic, our view of the world is that even with that variability that you're projecting, there is a content increase for device that we feel comfortable mutes that out and so we think over the long run mobile is pretty solid. And again we're taking a look at all the market segments and there is networking we think will continue to be a good market for us hyper-scale servers as well as there is some balancing will do in general, but all-in-all we think mobile is a good place over the long run.","Ian Ing","Okay thanks and then in the DRAM server market, I mean, you talked about some pricing pressure, could you talk more about the sources of demand and the server side the next few quarters, there are some mixed signals out there you've got some suppliers talking about enterprise being stronger than cloud customer, I mean, any workloads that you're excited about the next few quarters?","Mark Durcan","All-in-all, I would say the enterprise market of the two appears to be more favorable for us. Datacenter is a little bit more commoditized I think. Some of the datacenters materials sometimes could be consumed with high-end PC grade material. But overall we think that the projection of the market in servers gets us in a new pretty good growth environment and as we look at that server again like mobile, we have a good market for us we're not -- we don\u2019t think it's a challenge for us as far as adding growth in the bits to that segment.","Operator","Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company. Your question please.","Rajvindra Gill","There have been some recent reports that a major competitor of yours could have 18-nanometer DRAM by the second quarter, calendar second quarter of next year, given the transition to 20-nanometer this year and next year, how do you think this impacts your competitive position in the overall market from a supply demand perspective?","Mark Durcan","That's a relatively muted step from 20 to 18 and relative to that particular competitor we think there are also some architectural changes that will cost them some rate efficiency, so we believe that notwithstanding the fact that other competitors will continue to migrate their technology at a more muted pace on a go forward basis we will continue to narrow the gap.","Rajvindra Gill","And just switching gears to the Inotera, how does the Inotera buyout affect your CapEx plans and will the Company plan to utilize Inotera's cash flow for non-DRAM products such as 3D XPoint, is that the also one of the purposes a little bit as well?","Mark Durcan","What we touched on the announcement that was on average, you'd expect to see Inotera add somewhere around $800 million a year to our CapEx that we have previously discussed and the reality is cash fungible, so it will add cash flow into the Company and the Company will direct that cash flow where it sees best so the idea of specifically saying that cash flow would be used for 3D XPoint is sort of a mute issue.","Ivan Donaldson","And unfortunately we are out of time today, so we'd like to end the call now and thank you everyone for your participation and please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

Mark?","Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. We had another outstanding quarter benefiting from strong market demand as well as solid operational execution. Our revenue was just under $4 billion while gross margins were stable at 34%. We had very strong free cash flow at $880 million based on operating cash flow of $1.46 billion less CapEx of $576 million.","I\u2019d like to spend some time touching on a few key areas of focus as we wrap up fiscal 2014 and continue preparing for fiscal 2015 and our brief industry update. Ron Foster will follow with a financial summary. And before turning to Q&A, we will close our prepared comments with Mark Adams covering additional details of our operational performance and market conditions.","Key focus areas for the management of the remainder of this year and for 2015 include completion of the planned 25-nanometer DRAM conversion, beginning the 20-nanometer DRAM ramp, this is critical to improving our relative cost position, active management of our DRAM product mix as we balanced servicing demand growth in categories such as server or mobile while also maximizing our margin profile across other long-term strategically important segments, continued execution of our ongoing and capital efficient 16-nanometer planar NAND conversion, investment in tools and engineering resources to support the initial deployment and ramp of our innovative 3D NAND technology, increased sales of 16-nanometer TLC NAND-based products, growth of a robust enterprise SSD product portfolio, continued development of our capability to deliver higher value system level solutions, including investments in advanced packaging and controllers and investment in newly emerging memory technologies to ensure we remain at the cutting edge of innovation. As you can tell, we do not plan to rest on our laurels.","For 2015, as well as for the longer term, we will continue to be measured and prudent in our capital spending and we will also maintain flexibility to regulate capital expenditures based on the return profile of the investment, including of course the impact of any change in market conditions. And we will provide more detail on our specific CapEx plans at a later date, but as we work through finalizing our plans for 2015, it is notable that an increasing amount of our spend will be targeted towards non-supply related investments. These include investments for tooling and alternative memories, advanced test and packaging capability and additional system level product capabilities, including those for controllers and SSDs.","We will also be aligning our Micron Memory Japan and Micron Memory Taiwan toolsets with other fabs around the world in support of enhanced operational efficiency. We have no plans to expand wafer production and we expect the big growth we generate from technology in calendar 2015 will be in line with growth for the market for DRAM, which we are forecasting in the low to mid 20% range and in line with growth for the market for NAND, which we are forecasting in the low 40% range.","Our long-term outlook for memory industry conditions also remains favorable. The supplier base is consolidated in DRAM and stabilized in NAND and we believe that in both markets, the industry is in a stage of maturity such that each supplier has sufficient scale to compete. Driven by a slowing rate of technology migration, supply bit growth trends have stabilized at a level below historical average. There appear to be only limited additions of new wafer capacity on the horizon. Applications requiring memory continue to grow and our customer base continues to diversify. We remain committed to delivering differentiated and system level products to meet the needs of this increasingly interesting and valuable market. We continue to forecast long-term demand in line with or above supply for DRAM.","Similarly for NAND, beyond 2014, we expect the industry\u2019s supply growth to remain in a similar range. Although as 3D production becomes more predominant heading into 2016, we may see a slowdown in supply growth given the technology complexity and additional clean room space required. We expect long-term NAND demand to be in balance relative to the supply going forward.","I will stop here and turn over to Ron and Mark before turning for Q&A.","Ron Foster - Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Finance","Thanks Mark. Our third quarter of fiscal 2014 ended on May 29, we posted to our website a file containing the financial information I will cover, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the third quarter, as well as guidance for the fourth quarter.","For the third quarter, we reported net income of $806 million or $0.68 per diluted share on net sales just under $4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter was $913 million or $0.79 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments netted to $107 million or $0.11 per share in the third quarter and included the following: restructure charges in the quarter of $9 million were primarily related to idle charges associated with shutting down operations in Israel and Italy. Amortization of debt discount and other costs of $36 million in the third quarter include imputed interest on our convertible notes and the discount on the Elpida installment debt. The $16 million loss on restructure of debt arose from the conversion and repurchase of convertible notes in the third quarter. I will touch on this further in a few minutes. Non-cash taxes from the legacy Elpida operations were $49 million in the third quarter. Cash taxes for the year are in the low single-digit percent of pre-tax income range as previously indicated. Finally, there is a $38 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the third quarter of $24.89.","In the fourth quarter, we expect the following non-GAAP adjustments. We anticipate incurring restructure costs in the fourth quarter for employee termination benefits in the range of $15 million to $25 million primarily in Italy, approximately $40 million amortization of debt discounts on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt during the fourth quarter. We expect the fourth quarter results to include an approximately $90 million gain associated with Inotera\u2019s GDR offering last month since it was executed at a price above the carrying value of our investment. As of the end of Q3, the carrying value of our 33% equity interest in the total value of Inotera was approximately $700 million compared to the market value at today\u2019s trading price of approximately $3.8 billion. In addition, ON Semiconductor recently announced its pending acquisition of Aptina Imaging, of which we own an approximate 27% interest on a diluted basis. The transaction is expected to close either late in our fiscal fourth quarter or in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.","We expect proceeds from the transaction of approximately $100 million. The carrying value of our interest in Aptina has been written down to essentially zero through the recognition of our share of Aptina\u2019s losses over time. Accordingly, virtually all of the proceeds we received from the sale to ON Semiconductor will be recognized as a gain at the time of the closing. Non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition of between $65 million and $75 million in the fourth quarter and also the anti-dilutive effect of our cap calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Assuming a $32 share price, this would equate to a reduction in diluted shares of 27 million. Please refer to our convertible debt dilution table, which is included in the earnings call data file posted on our website.","Let\u2019s turn now to our results by technology and guidance. DRAM revenue decreased slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Both average selling prices and cost per bit decreased in the low single-digit range resulting in relatively stable margins comparing the past two quarters. Like-for-like product prices were generally stable, but we did see a mix shift from mobile and computing into server products as we balance supply in line with customer demand.","Our reported income from equity method investments for the third quarter was $135 million, substantially all of which is attributable to Inotera. If our share of Inotera\u2019s income were recorded in our DRAM gross margin in the third quarter, DRAM margin would be approximately 5 percentage points higher. DRAM gross margin for Q4 using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter should be flat to up slightly compared to Q3 based on bit production up low single-digits ASPs are flat and cost per bits down low single-digits. The key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the fourth quarter are continued favorable market conditions in DRAM, overall stable DRAM volumes, however with higher volumes of mobile in anticipation of customer demand, stable server volumes and decreased volume in PC, and stable to slightly increasing costs of products coming from Inotera.","Turning to NAND, on the trade NAND side, sales volume decreased in the third quarter with our shift toward SSD sales, which have a longer back end manufacturing cycle time. This also contributed to a slight increase in NAND work-in-process inventories. Trade NAND gross margins in the third quarter were stable quarter-over-quarter with generally flat mix adjusted prices and costs. Trade NAND gross margins for Q4 using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter are expected to be down a couple of points compared to Q3 based on bit production expected to be up low to mid-teens, ASP down low to mid single-digits and cost per bit flat compared to Q3.","Key trends for Q4 affecting this guidance are stable NAND market conditions. We expect an increasing mix of high-density NAND sales at generally lower ASPs, but still reasonable margins and we get more bits, continued growth in client SSD volumes with some initially higher BOM costs that impact margins, and the effect of a legacy pricing arrangement with a customer that\u2019s trending lower through the first quarter of 2015. On a consolidated basis, we are guiding total revenue for the fourth quarter in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. Fourth quarter gross margins are expected to be adversely affected in the $30 million range by a last time sale of end-of-life legacy architecture products, not included in our DRAM and NAND guidance that I just went through.","Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, the company generated $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in the third quarter and ended the quarter with $4.8 billion in cash and marketable investments, including $2.6 billion held by Elpida and its subsidiaries. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment in the third quarter were $576 million and we are on track to be within our guided range for the fiscal year now estimated to be between $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion, with over $1 billion of expenditures planned for Q4. Actual spending may vary based on the timing of payments and our tool receipts.","Since the beginning of our fiscal year, we have utilized approximately $2.1 billion of cash to convert or repurchase $1 billion of face amount of convertible notes and to reduce the share dilution associated with our convertible notes. This represents approximately 83% of our year-to-date free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx. Our dilution management strategy has year-to-date eliminated approximately 89 million shares associated with our convertible notes assuming the stock price of $32.","Specifically, in the third quarter, we used approximately $1 billion to convert or repurchase our 2014 convertible notes and a portion of our Series C and D convertible notes. In addition, the company unwound a portion of the cap calls to retire another 3 million shares. Collectively, these transactions in Q3 reduced fully diluted shares associated with our convertible notes by approximately 26 million shares at a $32 stock price. We intend to continue to opportunistically migrate our debt mix over time towards more straight debt with investment grade like covenants and rates and reduce our convertible debt.","Now, with that, I will turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.","Mark Adams - President","Thanks, Ron. On our last call, I introduced our new organization structure highlighted by the formation of four market-facing business units: computing and networking, otherwise CNBU; storage referred to as SBU; mobile, MBU; and embedded, EBU. I will review our performance in first quarter under the new structure and then end with some technology and operating highlights from our third quarter before handing it back over to Kipp. For comparative basis, we will use restated numbers for prior periods as if we operated under the new structure in the past.","Our computing and networking business had a strong third quarter characterized by improving demand and favorable pricing. The PC market appears to be more favorable compared to prior industry forecast and supply remains constrained. Pent-up demand for corporate refresh on desktop and notebooks seems to be leading to better-than-expected sector performance. PC DRAM pricing is improving both at major OEMs and in the channel as current forecast remains strong for Q4 and through the holiday season. Demand for server DRAM is also increasing. Server bits were up 30% quarter-on-quarter driven by data center and enterprise growth in density per unit memory content leading to enhanced system level performance. Demand for our networking products remained healthy as well driven by LTE build-out in China and other emerging markets. Networking DRAM pricing improved quarter-over-quarter driven by richer mix of products and continued strong demand.","Finally, our graphics business had record shipments and revenue in the quarter with strong sales of GDDR5 products driven by key OEM penetration both PC and console gaming. On the technology front, we continue to drive innovation with products such as DDR4 for servers and high-performance desktop applications; GDDR5 into high-performance gaming PCs and workstation graphics; and Hybrid Memory Cube for high-performance solutions in networking and computing. For example, DDR4 is in qualification at Tier 1 OEMs for both server and computing customers. We see initial DDR4 shipments in fiscal Q4 2014 and forecast that DDR4 will represent approximately 20% of CNBU DRAM output and close to 10% of our overall DRAM output in the second half of fiscal year 2015.","As we projected on our second quarter call in April, Q3 represented a turnaround quarter for our storage business unit in overall SSD volume. We were able to drive customer qualification of our NAND flash capacity from our Fab 7 conversion, as well as launch our first 16-nanometer based products for key channels and customers. Revenues for client and enterprise SSDs each increased by well over 50% compared to our second quarter.","We launched our first 16-nanometer client SSD drive, the MX100, at Computech and have received strong customer commitments out of the gate for a performance leader in the SSD value segment. We also see OEM growth with the M510 and M550 client drives and have a strong customer interest in terabyte-class client SSDs for immediate workflow, cloud and other applications, where a high reliability and performance coupled terabyte-class capacity and competitive pricing are critical. We launched the M500 DC SATA enterprise drive for data center applications and received a large volume commitment from a major search company to address their storage needs.","We are aggressively working on our development of our 16-nanometer TLC roadmap in an effort to drive our overall NAND cost competitiveness. We expect to see component samples of our 16-nanometer TLC by the end of calendar year with client-based TLC SSD by spring of 2015. We continue to grow our controller and firmware organizations to help align our PCIe and SaaS roadmap to enterprise customer requirements. We believe our innovative 3D NAND technology will enable a highly cost-effective solution and a competitive advantage in high-performance applications. We remain bullish on the long-term market in NAND. We see opportunity for progress and feel the organization changes we have made, coupled with technology investments will enable us to drive improved results to the course of fiscal year 2015.","Our mobile business had an outstanding quarter highlighted by an 18% operating margin in a business that just 12 months ago was underwater. We continue to focus our mobile business on generating maximum returns as opposed to simply market share growth. The team has done a nice job in balancing out the demand from our Tier 1 OEMs, while taking advantage of the more segmented opportunities in the Tier 2 China market. The low-power DRAM category remains favorable demand supply balance and our known good die business is constrained due to the growth in mid and high-end phones related to LTE builds for China.","The mobile team has qualified eMCP products at key OEM customers and we are beginning volume shipments in our fourth quarter. We expect that eMCP and eMMC mobile products will scale significantly to approximately 25% of the overall mobile revenue in fiscal year 2015 compared to less than 10% today. We have also commenced sampling low-power DDR4 to our partners and chipset vendors and expect to see shipments towards the end of fiscal year 2015.","Our embedded business had another strong quarter with revenues of $467 million and an operating profit of 21% driven by growth in DRAM, NAND and NOR product sales in the quarter. Revenue was up 34% year-over-year in the new embedded business classification. The automotive segment continues to benefit from memory content growth fueled by both infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems. Our commitment to the unique needs of this market in areas such as quality, reliability, product longevity and service has enabled us to grow our number one position in the market.","The broad category of industrial and multi-market, otherwise referred as IMM, showed strong double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter in part fueled by the integration of connectivity and emerging machine-to-machine usage with industrial applications. We also saw strong performance in the connected home segment across all of our product categories. We continue to see strong sales growth in eMMC for embedded applications as well. With the sale of our NOR fab in Israel, our idle fab charges will wind down over the next couple of quarters and thus we anticipate improving gross margins for NOR going forward. It is worthy of note that when you factor in products such as SSD, mobile eMCP and eMMC as well as eMMC for the embedded market, a significant portion of our business is now packaged with a controller and in some cases with a NAND DRAM combination.","We think this is a good example of how our business is evolving to more systems and subsystem-level solutions. We anticipate this dynamic to continue to be an increasing part of the new memory paradigm. Our manufacturing team had a tremendous progress in improving our overall operational competitiveness. Front end cycle time, across all products, have improved over 30% since the beginning of our fiscal year. In addition, we set a record of 15 days for time to mature (indiscernible) on our 16-nanometer to NAND technology. As our business continues to expand into diversified end markets such as enterprise, networking, mobile, automotive and gaming, we continue to invest in our test assembly and supply chain capabilities to support an expanding set of customer requirements.","We have seen strong improvements in the throughput volume of an increasingly differentiated set of products in test and assembly in setting a record for assembly yields over 99% during Q3 as well as improved our online \u2013 on-time delivery performance despite a constrained memory market. Overall, the memory \u2013 the pricing environment for our products remains favorable. PC demand is better than expected in our mobile supply is constrained. In both cases, we have large customers looking to lock in long-term pricing and supply commitment from us.","On the NAND front, pricing is relatively stable on a like-for-like basis despite moving our portfolio to higher density storage products in some cases with lower average ASPs. We feel this positions us better for the future in these critical growth markets for NAND. We also project dramatic improvements in our mobile NAND business with eMMC and coupled with DRAM and eMCP products for fiscal year 2015. In this segment, we can leverage our portfolio brand breadth of NAND and DRAM to drive the profitable growth.","In closing, I want to congratulate our team for a strong third quarter performance. We remained bullish on the health of the overall memory market. Our product mix continues to evolve to solutions optimized to specific end-market needs and we continue to drive higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness. We look forward to a strong Q4.","With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.","Kipp Bedard - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks Mark. We would now like to take questions from callers. Just a quick reminder, if you are using a speaker phone, please pickup the handset when asking a question so that we can hear you clearly. And with that, please open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead sir.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yes, good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay?","Mark Durcan","Yes.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Guys, a quick question here first on the DRAM front. I am just kind of curious when you look at the pricing in the fiscal third quarter and the guidance in the fiscal fourth quarter, I would have thought just given pricing trends in the industry, and more importantly, some of the mix drivers for you like DDR4, that you would perhaps have seen better pricing on the DRAM side of the business. Can you just help me understand a little bit about what\u2019s happening on the mix side that\u2019s driving the guidance for sort of flat pricing for the fiscal fourth quarter? Thanks.","Mark Adams","Well, I think as you have identified, it really is obviously all mix-driven for us. Some of which is related to some of the specialty markets lagging in the pricing catch-up relative to the PC segment. One of the things we have stated on prior calls is that each of these businesses is obviously very unique with a unique set of customers and we are committed to all the markets. We have seen tremendous server growth and we expect that to continue to improve over time, but in general what we are just seeing is a mix effect drive, basically a stable pricing relative to where we are today.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Thanks Mark. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, guys, just on the ramp of the 16-nanometer TLC and NAND, as that happens over the next couple of quarters, can you help us or help me get a better understanding of the magnitude of the cost savings? And maybe you can talk about, if you had an optimal mix of TLC today, how much better would the profitability be in the business at the operating or gross margin level?","Mark Adams","Yes. I mean, a range to expect on TLC at a bit level somewhere between a 15% to 20% improvement. And as we are not specifying the actual table, we look to be in the market not just with components in the early part of the calendar year, but we should have a strong SSD play in the later part of the first half.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","Thanks for taking my questions. You have mentioned long-term commitments, can you say how long those \u2013 the long-term is, is it six months, is it a year?","Mark Adams","Right now, the commitments we are looking at somewhere between 90 days and six months. And mind you, we are pretty careful about this, because these agreements have to be favorable for us over the long-term and so we have to lock in both the capacity supply piece of it as well as the pricing. And so we do these where we have confidence that the long-term relationship will drive the right behavior between both parties.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","Okay, great. And maybe on the follow-up, you had mentioned that DDR4 was going to become 20% of the CNBU\u2019s shipments in the second half of 2015. Is that at the cost of PCs or I guess is it just the mix shift you are making?","Mark Adams","It\u2019s really going to start out more in server upfront. And we will only do this and our current plan has us generating higher margins in this DDR4 category and we will \u2013 we certainly won\u2019t do it, if it\u2019s margin adverse. And we feel pretty confident we are going to drive differentiation with our customers and allow them to drive performance. And so right now that\u2019s where our plan has and we feel pretty confident we are going to drive to that result.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one clarification first on the potential long-term agreement, so are you saying that you have locked some in or are planning to and what kind of commitment would that be relative to your overhaul capacity?","Mark Adams","We have locked some but not a majority. And we have looked at each of them on their own merit in terms of the value of the relationship that we are able to drive in terms of portfolio of our products as well as market access.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Okay. And then just a little bit more color on maybe the mix trends that play out beyond this quarter, can you just sort of talk about how you think maybe between now and year end some of the mix relates to specifically on the enterprise side? So server DRAM and enterprise SSDs, what is your outlook for demand from those areas for say through December 31?","Mark Adams","We still are very bullish on enterprise DRAM opportunities for us. And if you look at the server bit growth, I mean, I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me, but within the last two years, we were somewhere on the 150 million gigabit equivalents per quarter. I just stated that we were up 30% quarter-over-quarter, that was slightly below 500 million gigabit equivalents and that continues to grow in the server DRAM business and we think it\u2019s going to continue to grow. Really, the density per box is a big differentiator in terms of performance. And we also think the hyper scale cloud and data center growth is just going to continue for the foreseeable future. And the enterprise business, we obviously continue to see growth there as well in the end markets. We also see that we feel it\u2019s early. And there is different formats. There is hybrid drives, there is obviously SaaS and PCIe and we think we are at the beginning of a long game there with a lot of exciting opportunities and we continue to invest that way.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","So, is it fair to say that the mix in those two areas that you just pointed out should be higher by the end of the year versus where it is midyear?","Mark Adams","Let me jump in a little bit on the server piece. Clearly, there is very strong demand there and we have been \u2013 we have had more than our fair share of that segment in the market for long time based on service levels and quality levels etcetera. As we look at each of these segments though, as Mark has commented, we are going to be careful to make sure that we are looking at the long-term ramifications of the relationship with all those customers as well as optimizing our margins going forward. So, it\u2019s not just a matter of growing share in the fastest growing segments, it\u2019s a matter of balancing that with the return for the company as well.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Great. I appreciate the color. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Starting with NAND, I am a little bit surprised that the cost is tracking flat for two consecutive quarters can you please provide an update? Is it just the matter of timing before 16-nanometer kicks in or how should we think about this progress?","Mark Adams","Well, thanks for the question. I think you identified one element to the equation. The primary driver, as I mentioned in my comments earlier was that we started to get back into the SSD game in scale and as that BOM cost includes all of the SSD build material, so that impacts cost that we classify under NAND as well as what you mentioned is that the \u2013 while going very well, we don\u2019t set to get the full cost benefit until future quarter.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","So, how should we think about or how do you differentiate between the debt cost versus non-debt costs? Which one is having more of an impact?","Mark Adams","We tend to not want to give that data from a competitive perspective. It is just with the best way to take a look at it is to take a look at quarter-by-quarter the volume on SSD and how that might trend relative to cost per gigabit.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Got it. And then one question for Ron, thanks for providing guide. I just needed clarification on gross margin. Did you say that gross margin would be down by $70 million and if so can you explain again what the reason is?","Ron Foster","Mehdi, what I broke was that I gave you the DRAM outlook including the margin trend and the NAND outlook including margin trend. In fact just to comment on that for a minute and then I gave you another piece which I will elaborate on. On the NAND margin trend, we actually indicated we were going to probably be down a couple of points Q2 to Q3 and we are actually flat. We are now thinking we will be down a couple of quarters predominantly mix driven, just so you know where that tie-in comes. But as you look at the total Q4 trend, we gave you the DRAM pieces, the NAND pieces where we think will be down a couple of points. And then there is a $30 million effect related to some expected sell-through of legacy technology inventory in the fourth quarter. And that will be basically \u2013 float out in the third quarters, but I wanted to call that out, because it\u2019s a somewhat unique effect. It\u2019s a technology required from our Numonyx acquisition and we will be replacing that with new emerging technology over time, but we did have some legacy inventory that we are selling off and that\u2019s related to a specific approach to phase change that we are no longer pursuing in favor of other variance of the technology. So that $30 million is in addition to the guidance on NAND and DRAM I gave you.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","Yes, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on solid results. Just a question on the SSD strategy, given some of the recent consolidation or acquisitions that you have seen from your competitors, wondering what\u2019s your response to that and how do you intend to kind of compete on the enterprise SSD space, given this recent acquisition and consolidation by your competitor?","Mark Durcan","Yes, so this is Mark. There has been ongoing activity in this area over a number of quarters, including as you know the most recent one. We continue to grow our businesses methodically and organically as well as look at a number of inorganic opportunities over time. When we see one that we think is a good fit for Micron, we will execute on it, but we are not going to comment in advance on which ones those might or might not be and we are certainly not going to comment on acquisitions by any of our competitors.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","And it was pushed a little bit on the previous question, but can you talk a little bit about some of the tangible tailwinds you see on the NAND gross margins over the long-term? And how do you expect to get those NAND margins up, whether perhaps closer to some of your competitors?","Mark Adams","Yes, sure. So, firstly, as I commented on, we think the enterprise market is a very attractive market for the enterprise storage devices and continue to make investments in building out capabilities around our controller team, our firmware team. We have had a very good entry in the PCIe enterprise storage class products and great performance there and we continue to grow and continue to invest in SaaS as well. So, we believe that we will grow that business accordingly and be successful in that business. Secondly, as I commented on my earlier comments, we are continuing to drive and accelerate to a TLC roadmap that takes advantage, the cost advantages there. And I would say finally, we believe that beyond SSDs, the mobile market for NAND will be a good contributor for overall margins over the long-term and that\u2019s really how we collectively look at this business. We are in this business for long-term. We are going to make these investments and drive overall, our capacity strategy and end-market product roadmaps that way.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks for taking my questions. First is on the CapEx, CapEx has almost doubled quarter-over-quarter, so could you kind of give a split between NAND, DRAM or is it more be weighted towards 3D NAND?","Mark Durcan","For the year of fiscal \u201814, the number that I gave you was 2.8 to 3.2, that\u2019s over $1 billion of capital fourth quarter as you have observed. It\u2019s just timing of payment schedules, but within the range that we have been guiding for a number of quarters now. And in terms of the breakdown, it\u2019s heavier to DRAM. It\u2019s probably 40% DRAM, 30% NAND and the remainder in a bunch of other areas, including R&D.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks. Just then a question on the 3D NAND, could you maybe talk about when you expect to have samples of 3D NAND? And when do you think you will ramp 3D NAND basically conversion from 2D NAND to 3D NAND? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Yes, Monika, we are not \u2013 we have commented on previous call that we would have more to say about that later in the year and we are not planning to make any announcements as to explicitly when we might sample or announce any products in that area. We have said that we believe that this is going to be a material impact on the industry in the second half of 2015 and we wouldn\u2019t change that guidance today.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse from ISI Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","C.J. Muse - ISI Group","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question is a follow-up. On the 3D NAND side, curious as you think about some of the well-known I guess issues there at one of your competitors, curious how you think about supply demand heading into next year and whether or not the industry will need to add incremental planar capacity to meet expected demand if the issues around 3D persist?","Mark Adams","It\u2019s probably hard to speak for our competitors in that way, but I would say that our intent is to keep going down the path we are. We have stated in Mark\u2019s comment we have got a plan in place that we are not making any changes to that plan today and as we look at industry demand over that period, we will consider matching up our customer requirements, but in general, we are on a plan with the current 3D strategy is not going to really affect our planar output.","Mark Durcan","Yes. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 let me add a little bit to that, Mark, it\u2019s really hard to look at the NAND business today and the changes coming with 3D NAND technology and say makes a lot of sense to make large investments in planar NAND. So, I think to the extent some of our competitors have issues with 3D NAND technology. I wouldn\u2019t expect to see anybody go in and backfill out with incremental planar NAND, I would just expect the market to be a little tighter as competitors work through that situation.","C.J. Muse - ISI Group","That\u2019s helpful. And I guess as a follow-up to your prepared remarks regarding system-level investments, curious, I guess first, if you can opine on I guess where on the technology side, whether controller, firmware, etcetera that where you think you might need incremental technology as well as whether you would pursue partnerships or whether it would be pure organic or acquisition driven?","Mark Durcan","This is just a big, big space to cover. When you start think about stores and all the places it goes and all the end applications and interfaces you have got, you got mobile applications, you got client, you got data center, you got hardened enterprise, you got UFS, you got PCIe, you got SaaS, you got SATA, it\u2019s a lot of engineering resources across a broad spectrum to service all those system-level solutions. And so the answer is yes, all of the above. Micron needs incremental controller resources in all those areas, firmware and software resources to support those incremental controller resources and we are working at all of those areas both organically and inorganically and will continue to do that. So, stay tuned, but we are not going to broadcast in advance exactly what we may or may not do.","C.J. Muse - ISI Group","Sure. If I could sneak in one last one, can you provide an update on where you are in terms of shrink on the DRAM side, 25-nanometer and 20-nanometer, in terms of I guess this year or next year?","Mark Adams","Sure. So, today, as you know, we have got 25-nanometer product, about roughly 30% of our mobile DRAM is on 25-nanometer. Today, very little is in the PC DDR3 space on 25-nanometer. Going forward, obviously that will shift and improve in terms of the mix on the 25-nanometer node. And remember, as Inotera has probably stated, they are going to bypass 25-nanometer and go directly to 20-nanometer and we expect \u2013 and we can\u2019t speak to them, but we expect them to be out in the early part of 2015 with early volumes and customer qualification and meaningful volumes in the back half of 2015. And then over time, we will begin the migration of our capacity that way as well.","C.J. Muse - ISI Group","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital","Great. Thanks for taking my question guys and congrats on the strong results. If I could dig into the CapEx increase just a little bit more on the quarterly spend rate, Ron, you did say it had to do with the timing of payments. How should we think about that equipment getting turned on? And is there an inflection at all in the bit growth that we should see in maybe the Q1 quarter as that equipment gets put in place?","Ron Foster","Yes. So, it\u2019s just mainly timing quarter-to-quarter and variation, but the way we normally recognize CapEx is when we pay it. So, when we actually pay it per vendor agreements. And typically, those vendor agreements have qualification process just to enable them to be available for production. So, it\u2019s a function of when they are available for production and we pay according to our vendor agreements. So, yes as we go forward, that will certainly contribute to what Mark and Mark have been commenting about with bit growth trends over time as well as migrating some of the new product technology areas, but it can vary based upon the qualification scheduling of the technologies and the individual machines. Keep in mind as Mark also mentioned, we have got a number of investment going on in other areas such as 3D NAND technology and it has a little bit different timeline etcetera. So, there is a lot going on inside, Micron. The timing, quarter-to-quarter, tends to vary around, but I gave you the full year view and that was about where we thought we would be for the year, just some slipped out of the third quarter into the fourth, a little bit more than planned.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital","Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And it\u2019s a great segue into my next question. There is a lot going on between all the different technology transitions you guys are doing. When we merged Micron and Elpida, we really did not see much in the way of any R&D synergies. Is there a point in time at which maybe the R&D roadmaps start to come together and joint development efforts might increase, such that we should see maybe some synergies be realized on the R&D lines? Is there anything that we should be thinking about there?","Mark Durcan","Well, I don\u2019t want to forecast too far in the future, but Doug, I think you have identified a potential benefit downstream as we remember, Elpida was on a roadmap to 25-nanometer upon the acquisition. And we have obviously continued in parallel with the 20-nanometer investment on the R&D line. I think out in the future as the market warrants and dictates from a financial return perspective, you can envision us getting to a single architecture out beyond 20-nanometer.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital","Okay. And with that would that \u2013 and that could lead to some sort of an R&D synergies?","Mark Adams","Potentially.","Mark Durcan","Yes, it could, Doug, but keep in mind we are also making investments in storage-class memories and advanced system-level solutions etcetera. So, I think the nature of R&D is going to change. We are not as focused on driving that R&D line down as we are making sure that we are deploying whatever capital we do spend or whatever corporate resources we do allocate to R&D that we use them effectively and efficiently.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital","Alright. And if I could sneak one more in, can you talk a little bit about the wafer output that you are going to see in the back half of the year, maybe in a percentage Q3 over Q4 and then going forward and whether those are internally or purchased from Inotera?","Mark Durcan","I think the best way to characterize that, we see that as generally flat quarter-over-quarter.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital","Great, thank you. Congrats on the strong results.","Mark Durcan","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Newman from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Hi, thanks and congrats for the good results again. Question is more on the NAND side, it seems like, if you talk about \u2013 you are talking about a few things going on there, it seems like you are having some success on the SSD side. But from what I understand, it seems like the TLC part of the equation seems to be getting pushed out a little bit. So, I just wanted to check with you in terms of those two things, the movement towards more SSD solutions, what has worked and what are the kind of stumbling blocks for moving further, in terms of getting more SSDs, enterprise, end-computing PC SSDs out of the door to improve your mix? And similarly, on the TLC side, what is it that is delaying TLC adoption? Did you foresee those things being fixed? And if you could talk specifically through if those are more controller-related or silicon-related on the TLC?","Mark Adams","Well, maybe I could start with the question on market access and what we think is working. Remember, there are two dynamics that were going on over the last two quarters. So, when I commented on in the April call about this, one of which is we were obviously converting new capacity to NAND in our Singapore Fab 7 and that material need to get qualified with our major customers. In addition, we were also shifting from 20-nanometer and 25-nanometer drives to new product development on 15-nanometer and 20-nanometer high end drives. That transition at the time of the Singapore fab slowed our growth not necessarily driven by market growth, but driven by our ability to get customers quals and our products ramped at the right time. You saw the improvement in Q3 and that\u2019s really \u2013 it should highlight that our access to the market is pretty strong. Our customers are relying and we drove pretty good results, but so it wasn\u2019t something that I would say that we change behaviorally, it was just some transition in both technology and where the capacity was coming from. And we feel pretty confident we will continue to grow.","On the TLC side, I would say that we are now confident with our internal testing that we can drive high capacity TLC into solid-state market. We were also positioned as a performance even on the client side, a high-end performance high-quality drive with our OEM customers and we want to make sure we were able to drive the right volume and the investments in TLC. And we think with our 16-nanometer roadmap we can do so, and as I said, as I commented earlier, we will get there probably by \u2013 from a drive format by spring of 2015.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","So, on the TLC side, are those more things or improvements on the controller side or is that also a combination to the NAND silicon itself?","Mark Adams","I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. The controller piece has to handle obviously the error correction element of TLC and that\u2019s a little bit different, but I think the reliability of the TLC and the actual testing of it internally in our development, early stage modeling has got us to higher comfort level.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","And then just a follow-up on the SSD portion of the question, have you shared or maybe I missed the percentage mix of your NAND that is going into SSDs? And then if that\u2019s also broken out into enterprise versus PC as well by any chance?","Mark Adams","Yes. I am happy to do that. And let me just clarify, in the past we have actually included in our SSD revenue capacity we have sold to third-party SSD companies. And we are no longer going to do that. The best way to think about our SSD share today is that of overall NAND, SSD is roughly about 20% and that\u2019s up from 12% last quarter. And again for competitive reasons, I just don\u2019t want \u2013 I don\u2019t feel comfortable breaking out the enterprise client mix.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Okay, great. So, it\u2019s from 12% to 20% and\u2026.","Mark Adams","Of our overall NAND revenue.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Overall NAND revenue got it. And that\u2019s purely your own SSDs, not accounting going to third-parties?","Mark Adams","That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Great. And is that \u2013 any idea where that may go to fiscal Q4 and into next year in terms of percentage of mix?","Mark Adams","Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it will continue to grow. We don\u2019t want to set any numbers on the call, but it will be an upward growth from here.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Yes, I guess, all of this sounds good. I am just still a little bit curious why based on the guidance the next quarter\u2019s gross margin looks like it\u2019s going to come down, even with your mix improving SSDs. It seems like the ASP part of the line would be a little bit better, is there anything I am missing as to why that ASP wouldn\u2019t be better?","Mark Adams","It\u2019s really a function of our growth and our scale on getting big in some OEM sockets in terms of the SSD qualification and future business commitment. And the second piece on the margin question, as I mentioned, we are now getting 16-nanometer in volume obviously and that ramp is on the front end of the cost benefit curve that we would see in future quarters.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Got it, okay. Much appreciated. Thanks very much.","Mark Adams","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Sterne. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne","Yes, hi guys. Just going back on the same NAND question here, when you look at the SSD mix going from 12% to 20%, you mentioned some of the frontloading of the costs. As those costs flow through the August quarter, do you see NAND margins kind of bouncing back towards the end of the year into the November quarter?","Mark Adams","Well, it\u2019s again we try to avoid forecasting going into that kind of out in the future. We will continue \u2013 guys, we are going to continue to drive performance in this business. And we think we have got line of sight on the key fixes to drive better performance over the long-term.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne","And when you look at the 16-nanometer mix on the NAND side, where are you now and how much of the SSD goes to 16-nanometer, as you look out towards the end of the year?","Mark Adams","Okay. So, in terms of where we are in terms of leading-edge production for NAND, we are relatively light relative to we were 3% in the prior quarter and roughly of more or less, less than 20% in the \u2013 in Q4 we are projecting on 16-nanometer. So, we are still ramping the technology in this product and SSD is probably behind that as an overall mix.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne","Got it. Last question, I mean, when do you see those cost improvements on the 16-nanometer start to flow through? When do you start to see that manifest on the margin side?","Mark Adams","Yes. Probably, the best comment I would say is that out in the early calendar \u201815.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Kipp Bedard","I think we have time for one more caller.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Now that the transition in Singapore from DRAM to NAND is mostly behind you, can you talk about how you feel about the DRAM NAND mix today and what would drive you in the next few years to make further changes to change that mix?","Mark Durcan","Well, we feel pretty good about where we are at. We certainly are long-term believers in the growth of NAND demand. And as we learn more about what the elasticity of demand there is, I would think that it\u2019s more likely that market is going to outgrow the ability to service it with existing capacity than it is in DRAM. And so while we are pretty happy with our mix today we don\u2019t think in terms of flipping capacity back and forth on a go forward basis. I think we are kind of at least under today\u2019s conditions happy with the mix we have got and we will look at dialing our mix between different segments within NAND and DRAM and we will look over time at having the right capacity. More likely, that\u2019s going to be in NAND and DRAM as we move through time.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thank you. And then separately, you talked about the potential benefits in moving to more straight debt at investment grade, what would be the change that would gauge the timing of that? And what, it seems like your bonds are trading pretty well now like how do you think about that potential opportunity?","Ron Foster","Sure, Joe. Obviously, the market is pretty favorable right now with regard to straight debt. We did one of the early offerings in our rating class for high-yield debt and it turned out extremely well. We basically got an investment grade covenants and very close to investment grade pricing. Since that time, the market has got even better. We never know how long that will hold, but it\u2019s a very good environment today especially for Micron. So, we will be watching it closely and making moves as we think they are prudent over time in terms of our overall mix. But as I mentioned in general, we will be trending towards more high-yield given the current condition in rates and pricing and less in convert. We will continue to move on those over time as well to reduce them.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Joe.","Kipp Bedard - Vice President, Investor Relations","With that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

Mark?","Mark Durcan","Thanks Kipp. I\u2019d like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter and follow up with a few strategic and industry updates. Then I\u2019ll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary and we\u2019ll close with Mark Adams discussing key developments in our business units, operations and market conditions.","Our second fiscal quarter was highlighted by improving market fundamentals in memory, along with solid execution from an operations and financial perspective. We had significant growth in key segments, including SOCs and server DRAM. Personal Systems, a segment which has been a drag on our financial performance for some time, has rebounded significantly due mostly to structural supply shifts in the market.","As we suggested in the last earnings call, we took a significant step forward with the successful restructuring of our supply agreement with Inotera, effectively doubling the wafer output we receive from them. We\u2019re pleased with the increased scale and profit opportunity this restructuring process provided.","As you will have noted in the release, revenue in the quarter was up about 13%, with strong growth in DRAM and NAND. Gross margins were up significantly from 12% to 18%, again with improvements in both DRAM and NAND. Ron will get into more of the detail for the quarter from a financial perspective. We\u2019re building a very large and diversified memory business and remain focused on making capital and segmentation decisions to optimize margin and free cash flow over time.","The Elpida acquisition process remains on track. Creditors voted in favor of the reorganization plan and the Tokyo District Court approved the plan at the end of February. In addition, all of the country and regulatory approvals have been completed. Closing the transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of waiver and waiver of certain conditions, including finalization of the Tokyo District Court\u2019s approval order under Japanese bankruptcy rules and recognition of Elpida\u2019s reorganization plan by the U.S Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.","We believe Elpida\u2019s financial performance is consistent with current market industry trends. A successful close will increase our overall trade memory capacity by about 45% from today\u2019s level without impacting industry supply. This capacity initially will be all DRAM. However, our 300 millimeter capacity is fungible and can support other advanced memory manufacturing technology. We\u2019re taking steps to enable flexibility to transition a portion of our capacity demand should market demand and returns on our investment warrant.","I mentioned last quarter that we would continue to look for ways to streamline all of our manufacturing operations, including the 8-inch front-end capacity. With that in mind, we made the decision to sell our 200 millimeter image sensor fab in Avezzano, Italy in Q2. We believe this is a positive step to keep us focused on memory market and optimize our overall margin structure. We don\u2019t have any other plans to announce today, but we will continue to look for opportunities to streamline our operations.","In terms of the memory market, supply dynamics in particular appear to be healthy looking forward. We believe the DRAM industry wafer capacity will be down in both 2013 and 2014 and process technology upgrades are being stressed out, thereby reducing supply growth compared to historical trends. In the NAND market, we see a favorable supply and demand balance. We have the benefit of significant demand growth in several applications such as SSDs and smartphones, coupled with generally stable supply conditions due to slowing process technology changes.","I\u2019ll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.","Ronald Foster","Thanks Mark. The end of our second quarter fiscal 2013 was on February 28. On our website you\u2019ll find the schedule containing certain key results for the quarter as well as guidance for the third quarter. That information is also presented on the following slides.","For the second quarter we reported a net loss of $286 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion. These results, compared to the previous quarter\u2019s net loss of $275 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. We made a reporting change in the second quarter to reclassify gains in losses on foreign currency from other operating income and expense to other non-operating income and expense. This non-operating classification provides better comparability with the results of our semiconductor peers.","The historical periods have been reclassified to match the current period presentation. Accordingly, operating income for the second quarter, although a loss of $23 million, improved when compared to the operating loss in the first quarter of $97 million. Included in the $23 million operating loss for the quarter is $62 million charge in other operating expense for the projected loss on the pending sale of our Avezzano Italy facility which we announced on February 25. Included in this transaction which is expected to close in the third quarter, is the assignment of our wafer supply agreement with Aptina. This sale will the second spin off of 200 mm production capacity following the sale of our Japan fabrication facility in 2011.","Going forward we may restructure and dispose of other assets as we continue to optimize our manufacturing operations and focus on our expanding core business opportunities as Mark mentioned. In the non-operating category, we recognized losses on currency hedges relating to the Elpida Rexchip purchase amounting to $120 million in the second quarter. This is a result of the yen significantly weakening in the quarter. The hedge program we entered into at the signing of the sponsor agreement provided protection from a strengthening yen, while allowing for partial participation in any purchase price reduction if the yen weakened.","With the weakening of the yen, approximately one half of the savings from the lower purchase price for Elpida is reflected as a loss on the hedge and has been included in our income statement for the quarter. Any reduction in purchase price will not be recognized on our balance sheet until the transaction is closed using the exchange value at that time. We do not provide any guidance on hedging gains or losses given the extreme volatility of the yen at this time.","Non-operating expense in the second quarter also includes a $31 million charge associated with the repurchase of $464 million of face amount of 2014 convertible bonds. I will touch on this in more detail in a few minutes. Also in the results for the second quarter are favorable non-recurring adjustments to income taxes of $19 million relating to two non-U.S. jurisdictions.","Turning now to operating results and outlook. Trade NAND bit sales in the second quarter increased compared to the prior quarter primarily as a result of production increases from higher output of 20-nanometer devices. Trade NAND average selling prices were relatively flat quarter-to-quarter. We continue to see growth in SSD sales which increased just over 40% in the second quarter compared to Q1. Mark will provide more detail on these trends in a few minutes. Guidance for Q3 trade NAND is as follows. Estimated trade NAND selling prices will be down mid-single digits quarter-to-date including the projected effect of mix for the quarter.","Bit costs are expected to be down mid-single digits while bit production is expected to be up mid to high single digits. Key trends for Q3 affecting this guidance are, we expect a higher density product mix in both the NAND solutions group and the embedded solutions group, lowering both ASP and cost per gigabyte while increasing volumes, resulting in similar margins overall. In ESG the density increase is coming mainly from automotive and consumer applications. In NSG we expect to  sell an increasing number of SSD drivers with greater capacity per drive which slightly lowers the average ASP  and cost per gigabyte.","And we continue the migration to 20-nanometer process technology resulting in lower costs and increasing bit output. We expect to bit crossover this quarter. DRAM revenue in the second quarter increased 24% compared to the previous quarter primarily as a result of a 38% increase in bit sales, partially offset by 10% decrease in average selling price. The higher DRAM production was achieved in the second quarter due to strong operational performance and higher volumes from Inotera. The DRAM average selling price decrease in the second quarter is primarily caused by a higher concentration of sales into the PC market as a result of increased production taken from Inotera. These sales have lower per bit selling prices as well as lower per bit costs compared to other DRAM  products in our portfolio.","Wafers acquired from Inotera in the second quarter increased 26% as the new supply agreement took effect January 1. DRAM bit costs decreased 18% quarter to quarter, driven primarily by the higher concentration of lower cost products from Inotera. Overall, gross margin across all our DRAM products increased quarter to quarter by about six points. Note that our cost of wafers from Inotera will vary under the new supply agreement as market prices for DRAM products increase or decrease. The new Inotera structure is expected to be a net positive to our income and cash flow in Q3 as it was in Q2.","Guidance for Q3 DRAM is as follows. Quarter to date selling prices for DRAM products, included the projected mix effects for the quarter are up mid-single digits compared to the Q2 average. Projected bit costs are down mid to high single digits and projected production volume is up a couple of percent.","Key themes endpoints in this guidance are, 4 gigabit DDR3 volumes continues ramping with the effective improving margins while muting 30 nanometer bit growth and comprised over one half of DRAM bit sales in the second quarter. We expect an increase in mix of our 30 nanometer DRAM moving into the server and networking segments. We\u2019re seeing a somewhat higher percentage of our total bit production from Inotera, with improving product mix and costs that move directionally with prices in the market minus model. And output in the third quarter is muted as we plan to reconfigure a portion of our current DRAM capacity to enable NAND flexibility as Mark previously mentioned.","NOR sales decreased 14% in the second quarter, in line with our seasonal expectation. NOR revenue and costs in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat compared to Q2.","SG&A expense in the second quarter was below our guided range as a result of lower costs associated with pending legal matters. We expect SG&A expense in the third quarter to be between $135 million and $145 million.","R&D expense was $214 million in the second quarter and is expected to be between $225 million and $235 million in the third quarter. With the termination of the DRAM joint development program with Nanya virtually no DRAM development costs were shared with Nanya during the second quarter. The level of R&D expense in any given quarter could vary based on the timing of product qualifications and the volume of development wafers process.","The company generated $234 million in cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter, roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter includes a negative shift in working capital accounts within the normal scope of fluctuations that we see quarter to quarter.","Total inventories decreased slightly in the second quarter compared to Q1. The second quarter ended with cash and investments, including non-current investments of just under $2.8 billion.","Expenditures for property plant and equipment in the second quarter were $353 million, and we still expect total expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion. Note however that quarterly expenditures can vary depending on the timing of equipment receipts.","We successfully completed an offering of $600 million in convertible notes the first week of February. We also entered into caps calls to effectively minimize the dilution of these convertible notes. The bulk of the proceeds were used to repurchase $464 million base amount of our 2014 convertible notes that are coming due, effectively refinancing them out to 2018 and 2020. We paid holders a price very close to the market price for the notes. However, the accounting for the early redemption resulted in a non-cash charge of $31 million I mentioned earlier. Depending on market conditions, we may repurchase additional 2014 notes prior to their maturity.","Concurrent with the convertible note offerings, we published some recent financial information on Elpida, including pro forma financial summaries. These pro formas present historical financial information for Micron and Elpida as if the acquisition of Elpida Rexchip had already occurred, including the effect of purchase accounting. Elpida\u2019s U.S GAAP financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 reflects an impairment charge of $2.8 billion to write down property plant and equipment to its estimated share value as of that date.","As part of the pro forma adjustments PP&E is assumed to be further written down in purchase accounting by an additional approximate $2 billion to a new value just over $1 billion, resulting in the fair value of the net assets acquired equally in the purchase price. As a result the Elpida Rexchip acquisition represents an approximate 45% increase in Micron's wafer capacity with only a 15% increase in depreciation expense.","Now I will turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. Mark?","Mark Adams","Thanks, Ron. I am going to provide some more detail on our second quarter operating performance as well as share some observations about the overall market environment in the memory industry. Our NAND Solutions group recorded a 15% quarter-on-quarter revenue increase. Coming out of the holiday season, we were watching for potential dollar pressure in market pricing. However, NAND pricing was favorable in our Q2 as end markets for SSDs, smartphones and tablets remained strong demand drivers for increased NAND bits.","Micron's trade NAND was basically flat even while somewhat limited by growth in the high density solid state drives that has a decreasing effect on the ASP per gigabyte calculation. Margins improved in the quarter benefiting by increased shipments of our industry-leading 20-nanometer node improving our cost per gigabyte quarter-on-quarter. We shipped 1.1 billion gigabytes in our trade NAND in the quarter. We continue to grow our presence in the storage category with products aimed in segments such as personal storage, cloud and data center storage, and I\/O accelerators for the data center.","We shipped roughly 1.3 million solid state drives in our second quarter, up over 40% when compared to our first quarter. In Q2, SSDs represented 20% of our trade NAND business. If you include NAND component sales to SSD providers, around 40% of our trade NAND bits go into solid state drives. Our development of enterprise class SSDs is progressing well. Revenue roughly doubled last quarter, albeit off of a low base and continues to be an area of investment going forward. We began customer shipments of our P320H SLC based PCIe SSD and continuous strength in our SATA and [SAS] product roadmaps, positioning Micron as a broad provider of enterprise storage class products.","On the technology and operations front, we are making steady technical advancements with both our planar and 3D NAND technologies. We began shipping our 20-nanometer TLC NAND flash and continued to increase our 20-nanometer MLC production as well. Our 20-nanometer ramp is on track and we expect production crossover in the current quarter. Keep in mind, some of  our more value-added segments like SSDs often require additional time before utilizing the most leading edge process. This quarter, we will commence volume sales of our 20-nanometer based SSDs, including our recently announced M500, which ships in terabyte class entities with very competitive price points.","MLC represented about 80% to 85% of our wafer production in Q2 with SLC and TLC essentially splitting the remainder. Sales for our DRAM solutions group in the second quarter reflect the improving ASCs Ron referenced, combined with strong growth in bit sales [led] by increased volumes resulting from our new arrangement with Inotera. We are very pleased with the additional scale, stable gross margin percentage and operating margin leverage and strong market which this new structure provides. Revenue for DST was up 26% and our gross margins for DRAM overall improved by close to 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter.","We were pleased with the direction of several of our [DSC] segments. On the service side, we increased shares significantly at key OEMs and cloud service providers. Q2 was a record quarter in this segment with shipments of over 200 million gigabit equivalents. DRAM bit shipments in networking were up 20% compared to our first quarter and now represents roughly 17% of our overall DRAM revenue. We had another strong quarter and made progress to expand beyond the traditional large OEM business to smaller customers and distributors in the sales of our networking portfolio. DDR3 volumes eclipsed DDR2 volume for the first time and we are now sampling DDR4. RLDRAM continued to gain momentum and we had a strong design activity with enablers and OEM\u2019s for HMC, Hybrid Memory Cube. From a market standpoint, U.S carrier CapEx for LTE deployment is strong and data center networking remains a bright spot for investment by key OEM\u2019s.","On the operations front, we hit big crossover facility nanometer in Q2. We anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to ship 25 nanometer technology and volume during our second half 2013 calendar year. in addition, our team continues to make progress on the development of our 20 nanometer product as we look to start sampling that project technology by the end of the calendar year.","DRAM pricing has strengthened from the bottom and is up mid-single digits from the Q2 average quarter to date. Obviously, as with any recovering pricing environment, the channel or spot market starts out in front of our OEM contract pricing. While there remains a gap between spot and contract pricing, it is narrowing and we see that as a continuing dynamic in Q3.","Channel inventory is very tight and we are currently in allocations to several channel and OEM customers. the DRAM supply and demand balance appears to be favorable and we are well positioned to capitalize that going forward.","Sales by the Wireless Solutions Group were down 19% quarter over quarter, with a slowdown in the sale of feature phone driven products, including wireless NOR and SOC NAND.","As mentioned in our last call, we\u2019re growing our presence in the mobile DRAM space in particular, with low power DDR2 design for two of the top five smartphone makers. We\u2019re also now sampling low power DDR3 with major system on-a-chip suppliers which will enable end customers\u2019 design activities.","In anticipation of the Elpida close, we continue to work on rationalizing our product lines from a margin perspective as we seek to blend the best of the Elpida portfolio with our Micron product and technology. Our focus will continue to shift from feature phones to smartphone and tablets going forward, with a product portfolio focused on low power DDR2 and DDR3 as well as a growing portfolio around EMCP and e-MMC.","From a market perspective, improving pricing trends in PC DRAM and NAND is starting to positively impact the mobile market. We expect smartphone units to be at close to be up close to 40% in 2013, which is better than our initial forecast coming into the year driven by improved growth for entry level smartphones. In addition higher end smartphones continue to be significantly growing memory content, in particular for DRAM which is expected to increase roughly 30% to 40% year over year.","Our Embedded Solutions Group had a record revenue quarter in Q2 of roughly $282 million, with strong continued operating margins of 23% in what has traditionally been a slower seasonal quarter. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. We benefited from strong retail demand in Japan and the Americas. DRAM was a particular highlight driven by automotive and industrial, medical, military segments. We\u2019re ramping 45 nanometer NOR which now represents over 60% of our high density shipments and we\u2019re growing our presence in EMMC for the embedded segment with that revenue up 50% quarter over quarter.","Excluding these extraordinary charges that Ron alluded to, we were encouraged with the improvement in our operating performance in the second quarter. In addition, we continued to make progress on our overall cost structure. SG&A and R&D were in line with our guidance. We continue to drive our inventory lower. In fact, inventory was down $110 million quarter over quarter, which represents a decrease of over $350 million year over year over the past 12 months.","The sale of our Avezzano imaging fab is a good example of the steps we\u2019re taking to improve our long term operating efficiency. Our management team continues to work on integration plans as we prepare for the close of our Elpida transaction. As we\u2019ve interacted with the Elpida team members in planning the new Micron, we have grown more impressed with the people and resulting product and technology capabilities. Our customers have been extremely supportive of the acquisition and Micron\u2019s overall strategy. They clearly understand how memory is evolving to new applications and form factors as part of a solutions orientation away from the standard commodity module.","We are optimistic that end markets such as mobile, server, networking enterprise and embedded will continue to drive strong demand for our products and thus feel that both DRAM and NAND  will stay in good supply and demand balance in Q3. With that I will hand it back over to Kip.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks, Mark. We would now like to take questions from callers. (Operator Instructions) With that we would like to open up the phone lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","First question is, given that Inotera has spent pretty low CapEx in the past two years and they also guided to low CapEx for 2013. Could you maybe comment on where do you think Inotera is in its NOR transition roadmap and especially in comparison them to Micron's NOR transition?","Mark Durcan","So this is Mark. The Inotera fab is really just in the last phases of completing the 30-nanometer ramp. That CapEx is really pretty much completely funded at this point. So the forward-looking CapEx for them will occur late in 2013 and into the first half of 2014 to drive a 20-nanometer transition. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be overly steep but it could occur throughout the totality of 2014 with most of the CapEx coming in the front half of that year.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Okay. And then the, last question, Elpida, could you kind of give us any idea on what will be the spend on CapEx last year or do you see that CapEx to need to ramp up since Elpida was not able to spend enough money due to bankruptcy?","Mark Durcan","We are not going to comment on what Elpida has been doing on their internal operations. What we have told you before relative to forward-looking CapEx for Elpida, is that on average it just looks similar to our own technology migrations and capital intensity which we don\u2019t believe is overly burdensome.","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","First of all, you mentioned or alluded to the fact that you will be shifting some DRAM capacity to NAND over the coming quarters. Can you maybe give us anymore  color on what the magnitude of that shift might be and in what facilities?","Mark Durcan","We are not going to comment on particular facilities. And really what I intended to convey to you is that we were making steps to provide ourselves with flexibility to make those moves, but not necessarily a commitment to any particular timeline or magnitude of those changes. So I think what you will see is activity going on at Micron fabs in order to lay the ground work so that we have the flexibility to do that. In the short-term what that means is more engineering activity and a small amount of incremental tool installations and minor disruptions in ongoing operations, but no significant capacity decisions are made at this point.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Fair enough, thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe update for us your assumptions about what the NAND industry will do in terms of big growth for the year overall? And then where Micron expects to come in within that, given what you just talked about in the last question. Thanks.","Mark Adams","Jim, this is Mark Adams. I think the numbers, we kind of based our planning around in the 30% to 40% range of the NAND bit growth and I would expect Micron to be to the upper end of that range but basically right around there.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","So that\u2019s an incremental tick-down for the industry relative to what you talked about before, is that correct?","Mark Durcan","Just slightly, Jim, yeah.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","Can I just clarify a point, because when I hear your forecast -- not forecast but your statements about ASPs for the quarter in DRAM. Is it right to say that what's really happening is as you take on more Inotera wafers, it actually impacts the ASP increase because of mix but it actually is still contributing solidly to the profitability.","Mark Durcan","Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. There's really two things driving the cumulative impact on ASPs for us. One is the relative [lag] contract spot and the other is the change in our mix that has occurred with the addition of the Inotera increment. Now over time obviously we\u2019ll start moving more of that capacity into value-added segments. But the initial slug of capacity came in the PC area.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","That\u2019s an important point. Second thing Mark, actually just to clarify, you made a statement about channel inventory being very lean. I just wanted to clarify, when you look into distributors, you don\u2019t feel like those guys are trying to build inventory as they sometimes do when pricing is rising and related to that, are you also on allocation for NAND? You suggested you were selling DRAM.","Mark Durcan","The answer to the first question is we don\u2019t think that the distributors are in a good inventory position at this point relative to six, 12 months ago. We think it\u2019s a pretty lean there as well. Quite honestly there is just not that much capacity available for those channels for them to take that position. As it relates to the NAND piece of the equation, there are certainly pockets of NAND that are in tight constraint as well. A lot of that is driven by the production mismatch sometimes what the requirements are on higher density SSDs. So we\u2019re seeing real tough pockets on the [limits] of available supply for some of the SSD categories.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","Just one last quick question. Thinking about the pull that you\u2019re seeing for DRAM from now a variety of end markets, not just normal PC, I wonder if you could rank the end markets now in terms of what areas are pulling DRAM at the greatest or fastest growth rate be it server, networking, mobile or PC.","Mark Durcan","So what we\u2019re seeing in terms of overall raw capacity, it would be -- mobile certainly would be at the top of that list. PCs are probably second when you factor in tablets and it depends where you put tablets in the overall ranking. Server is actually pretty significant. You\u2019ve got single digit growth, but pretty significant server DRAM content growth and that\u2019s becoming more and more of a growth category in terms of bit consumption. And of course you\u2019ve got the automotive and networking as you go down that list.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","Is it fair to say that PC demand, ex tablets, is not so good right now?","Mark Durcan","Yeah, but in balance remember now it\u2019s kind of a science as you just highlighted. When you\u2019re a manufacturer of DRAM you\u2019ve got to make those calls on production based on where those products are going. You can\u2019t just take a mobile bit and make it available a PC guy or vice versa in a given production period. So the unit growth in PC might not be super high, but the balance of PC bits and PC demand is pretty healthy right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Congratulations. Mark, I\u2019m just curious on the NAND pricing environment. So typically this time of year is a seasonally weak period. In addition you\u2019ve got the largest NAND buyer in the world going through a well-publicized weaker than expected demand cycle, inventory work down ahead of perhaps a new product launch in a few months. I guess I\u2019m curious, your expectation for NAND pricing for the balance of the year and at what point independent of getting the Elpida asset do you think about raising the core CapEx of Micron from that 1.6,1.9 to maybe something higher?","Mark Adams","This is Mark Adams. I\u2019ll take the first part of the question. The NAND business is kind of funny when you think about where it was and where it is today. It used to be a very seasonal business. You had memory card and USB and MP3 players all over driven by either back to school or the holiday sales. Today where you see NAND bits going, that\u2019s more diversified and less seasonal. So you referenced some changing customer dynamics around NAND, but in general the demand driver is still really solid coming out of the holiday period as I mentioned in my opening comment. And we think it looks pretty good balanced when you think about 30% to 40% bit growth and when you still think about strong demand across a growing SSD environment, smartphones now we\u2019re growing the unit. We\u2019re taking on some more content. We think overall when you couple that with tablets it\u2019s a real healthy outlook for us in the remainder of 2013 calendar.","Ronald Foster","Let me take the CapEx piece. Let me take the CapEx piece. We're going to be very disciplined on CapEx here moving forward, and there is a lot of good reasons for that. First of all, of course, I already mentioned, we've got options relative to the capacity we have in terms of how we move that around between the various technologies and market segments to optimize margin. that can all be done relatively cost effectively. So I think in terms of, that\u2019s our most desirable way to adjust our capacity to match any imbalances we see. But beyond that there is a couple of reasons why it -- I think you will see that Micron in particular maybe others be somewhat reticent as they think about putting new fabs online and that\u2019s this whole technology environment that we see today relative to -- we have 20-nanometer in volume production.","I think most of the folks are working on technologies down as low as maybe be 14-nanometer for planar. But beyond that most of the competitors are working on 3D and you know there is just a big mismatch in the type of capacity you put in place for 3D versus what you put in place for those end of life planar technologies. And so I think people are going to be pretty circumspect about how much capital they go spend on their capacity over the next couple of years while their prepping for a 3D transition sometime out in 2015-2016.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Mark, that\u2019s helpful. Would you guys ever think about putting NAND inside of Inotera or will that stay predominantly a DRAM facility?","Mark Durcan","We are not going to talk about which fabs we would or wouldn\u2019t consider. We will consider, actually all our fab, all our 300-mm fabs I think are candidates and we are not going to be forecasting which ones we may or may not do.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Guys, one last quick one for Ron. Ron, when you look at the OpEx growth that you guys are kind of guiding to this quarter, how much of that is just improved revenue outlook versus maybe some one-offs. Are they on the legal front or some R&D stuff that you have to get done that\u2019s driving that? I am just trying to get a  sense of what's variable growth versus maybe some stuff that just had to get done?","Ronald Foster","Yeah, John, in terms of the OpEx risk last quarter, we had a couple of favorable [effects] I called out in the SG&A side regarding legal expenses, and they just happen to be lighter related to some of those legal activities that are hard to predict and they have lumpiness in accruals. On the R&D side, it varies, as I commented related to wafer calls and timings of releases of products to production. So some of that\u2019s shifting between COGS and R&D, so it's a question of which bucket we put it in. So you need to understand that where in many cases it's just moving dollars around. But the guidance I gave you for the third quarter is roughly in line with where we have been historically and I would see it as a more normal trend line.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Steven Chin with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Steven Chin - UBS","First question is on the conversion of DRAM capacity to NAND. I think a couple of years back when some of your peers were doing that every so often, I think it took them about a month or so, maybe a little more than that to get the full yields on the asset conversion. Can you talk about how long it would take for you guys to achieve the same improved yields after converting to NAND capacity given to be fully utilized premium space in most of your fabs.","Mark Durcan","I can't vouch for your timeframe on what the competitors have done previously [lost] at mature yields. However, I would say that anything that we would consider would be on a much lower frequency than switching back and forth to take advantage of short market cycles. It would be much more along the lines of permanent transitions as opposed to high-frequency change to capture small changes in temporary market conditions.","Steven Chin - UBS","Thanks, Mark. My other question is just in terms of memory content, can you guys talk about what the current NAND content is in SSDs in terms of sweet spot and where you expect to be in the year. And similarly, can you also run through the same for mobile DRAM and PC DRAM.","Mark Adams","Sure. I am assuming you are referring to the volume segment to client business. On average it's kind of in the 127-128 gigabyte on the client side. When you look at the enterprise part of the business, obviously a little bit higher, towards the, somewhere in the mid-240 on the enterprise side and we think that will continue to go up. As I mentioned earlier, it's interesting that we had a little bit of a negative impact on the ASP per gigabyte calculation as you go to higher density drives. But we think that will continue to go, as far as the density consumption, that will continue to go up throughout the year both in the client SSDs.","Steven Chin - UBS","And how about for mobile DRAM products going to smartphones and also PC DRAM?","Mark Adams","Well, I think what we're seeing in general on that side is continuing increase in content albeit at a much lower amount or quantity if you will. If you look at gigabytes and gigabits -- DRAM's based on the gigabyte per your handset. In the smartphone business we\u2019re projecting it's up about 37% year-on-year. If you look at NAND in the premium segment, which is up double digits as well, we\u2019re seeing some of the tail off in some of the feature phone environments. But we think DRAM and NAND will continue to get pretty solid growth in content. Again it's nowhere near in comparisons to what SSD\u2019s volume is in terms of storage content, but again increasing content nonetheless.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","If you could talk a little bit about helping us understand how much of the business is presently exposed to contract based pricing versus pricing that we're able to see in the marketplace on spot?","Mark Durcan","Well Doug, as you know, we've increased our capacity a lot in terms of the NAND business with our restructure of the Intel relationship. On the DRAM side, this is the first quarter that we're seeing some of the effects of the Inotera volume and obviously Intel \u2013 the Elpida deal hasn't closed. So we're still more heavily weighted to OEM contract pricing in the volume markets, specifically and it's obviously true in specialty. So our model today is pretty heavily focused on contract and that's why as I mentioned in my earlier comments that that lag effects shows up in our ASP and Micron relative to what you see in the DRAM exchange. But we see that gap closing in Q3, like it normally does in a recovery market.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Is there any chance that we\u2019d get to a point in the industry that you guys feel comfortable enough with how much business is being done and the visibility that you have on that business such that you\u2019ll offer revenue gross margin and EPS guidance?","Ronald Foster","Doug, this is Ron. One of the \u2013 that's a good question about stability. One of the challenges we have in trying to give hard guidance if you will is just the variability in our pricing. Historically it's been related to wild variability and volatility in ASPs and PC DRAM pricing for example. Going forward, we have the added challenge of a very nice mix of products that we've been able to develop in the recent years and it continues to expand and as you've seen us call out in conference calls, we have a lot of mix adjustments we have to do in our messaging. With that combination of ASP volatility, which at least is still with us to-date and variation and mix, it's pretty challenging to try to call it. But we do try to point you as you know on the direction of where we think things are headed as best we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners","Real quick on the sale of the Avezzano fab. Does that mean your \u2013 when does that close and does that mean that the imaging category will finally just go to zero for you guys?","Mark Durcan","It will be very close to zero post-close which should happen sometime in the May timeframe.","Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners","So from August on and that, I assume is going to be accretive to your overall results. Can you talk how much \u2013 how accretive would that be to gross margin and how much OpEx comes out?","Mark Adams","Daniel, so first of all, it's a May close. So after May we wouldn't have any volume that would shift over. That's when the close actually occurs. In terms of impact on our financials, the Imaging business is a piece of our other non-segment category in our financial statement if you look at our 10-Ks and 10-Qs and it's a predominant share of it, but it's not everything that's in there. If I look at the recent quarters, we have been running relatively negative on margin, not large amounts. It's zeros to tens of millions of dollars kind of range per quarter and often around zero because that\u2019s the target in structuring. So you think about it, in recent history, it's probably a slight improvement, marginally a few million dollars per quarter.","Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners","Okay, thanks. And then going back to DRAM, Mark, you had mentioned that you saw DRAM wafer capacity was going down, if I heard that correctly. So in the industry, what gives you confidence that industry wafer capacity goes down and then what industry supply growth do you think we can get from technology shrinks alone.","Mark Durcan","You know the technology nodes are becoming increasingly complicated to drive the shift below 25-nanometer. So if you look at your -- depending on exactly what your process technology node is, you look at anywhere from 10% to 30% increase in complexity, moving to a 20-nanometer node in terms of overall floor space loading and total number of wafer moves. So the big range that people are moving from different places with different tool sets etcetera, but the trend is the same for all of us which is we need more lithography, we need more drives equipment etcetera, to facilitate filling. And although somebody is going to go out and build a new fab which, as I mentioned a little while ago, relative to NAND you have got some impediments with 3D on the DRAM side. You have got EUV technology over the horizon that you are going to build a bunch of bit doubling DRAM capacity in advance of a potential technology shift to EUV.","I think there is a lot of reasons why people may look at just living within their existing four walls and not tend to drive wafer capacity down while still driving an increase in bits. Was there a second part to your question?","Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners","Well that makes a sense. And just related to that is, so if people live within their own four walls now, as we go through change, what kind of bit growth do you think the industry is on? What kind of path do you think the industry is on purely from shrinks with no additional equipment.","Mark Adams","I think it's in the 20% to 30% range that most people are prognosticating and that looks about right to me.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Just two questions from me. First of all on server DRAM, you guys mentioned that you were gaining share during the quarter. I was just curious what you would attribute that to? And then secondly just back on SSDs. Referring to the growth rate that you talked about, the unit growth rate. How does that compare to the market and what would you consider your expectations for unit growth on enterprise and client going forward? I know you talked about average capacities but if you could sort of flush that out a little bit more that would be helpful.","Mark Durcan","On the first question as it relates to server, our growth has really been limited to our own capacity which is now increasing and as you look, we have actually had record quarters -- the last four quarters I believe in server, this is the first time we were over 200 million gigabit equivalent. And a lot of it has to do with the amount of server grade quality we have been getting out of our factories which again has been going up dramatically. Micron has been a leader in terms of the server DRAM business for some time and our customers are asking to continue to see out there. So we continue to see growth opportunities and as we ramp more server products we are getting out to the market. As it relates to the -- can you repeat the second part of your question on the SSD side?","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Yeah, I am just trying to understand the unit growth that you gave on SSDs, a little bit better and in terms of perspective on how you think the market is growing? And then what is the sort of outlook for SSDs going forward from a unit standpoint. You talked about average capacity, I am just trying to....","Mark Durcan","Yeah, so I think the overall SSDs we see year-on-year unit growth '13 over '12 in the 60% to 70% range. Of course ours is growing much faster than that. I think part of that is, you know any time you have a new technology like SSDs they were a lot of competitors in the market. Some were just weren\u2019t able to compete long term and that opens up market share for people who are in it for the long term, such as Micron. We have always said that we believe people with access to the NAND, manufacturing the NAND are going to have an advantage and we think it's driven by our growth in the SSD market that\u2019s playing out pretty well. And we are optimistic we are going to continue to outgrow the market in the short term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Goodman with CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities","Congratulations on the quarter. Question on the capacity. If you were to shift or convert some of the DRAM capacity to NAND, I know in the past you talked about this being able to happen at a discounted price, but how should we be thinking about incremental cash requirements to get that new NAND volume through a competitive geometry?","Mark Adams","I think the easiest way to think of it is there is a spend for 1,000 wafers per week or 1,000 wafers per month that we would typically make the move DRAM fab 4, the technology node or NAND fab 4 to technology node. It's about the same. So if we want to take a leading edge DRAM fab and move it forward, move it to a leading edge NAND node, it's about same spending that it would be to take the same path and move it forward to the next node in DRAM. It\u2019s that same capital intensity. It's just choosing a slightly different node to transition to.","Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities","I guess as a follow-up to that then just a little bit, so if you were to mix shift from DRAM to NAND, it\u2019s a positive for margins at face value that you\u2019re shifting into a sector where you probably have one or two shrinks to catch up if you are going just from where you are in DRAM to NAND. Costs are already getting a bit higher in NAND. There is some major transitions around the corner that are still unknown with vertical 3D, whatever it turns into. So I guess how are you thinking about the long term return potential on these conversion costs just between the conversion and the shrink versus -- especially now with DRAM it's looking pretty profitable. So I guess how are thinking about balancing those two opportunities?","Mark Durcan","Well, we\u2019re all about margins. So we\u2019re going to take a look at where we think the margin's going to be for us on a relative basis and it's got to be sustainable. But that\u2019s what I meant when I talked about low frequency and short frequency changes here. We\u2019re not going to be jerking our manufacturing capacity around to take advantage of short perturbations in the market, but we are going to try and align our capacity with the long-term demand and where we think we can drive higher margin business. So we identify an unfulfilled segment of the SSD market. We may want to go after capacity in place to service that. Likewise, if we see something particularly attractive in package-on-package DRAM or something of that nature, we want to make sure we're there too. So we're going to identify those high margin opportunities and move our capacity there to intercept them. Hope that\u2019s not too fuzzy for you, but that's really all I can tell you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","I was wondering, could you clarify, did your exposure to commodity PC DRAM actually go up on the quarter? Can you give us a sense of may be what that exposure is percentage wise for DRAM? And then also how you feel about that exposure. I know you mentioned that there's a favorable supply demand dynamic going on, but if you could punch through that and talk a little about what you see for PCM market trend? Thanks.","Ronald Foster","If I can help you a little bit with that, it did increase our exposure to personal systems memory, which is what you\u2019re referencing with from around 13% of total revenues in Q1 to around 18% or high-teens in Q2. I think I'll let Mark talk more around the pricing dynamics and the demand dynamics, but those are the favorable points for us.","Mark Adams","Yeah. I'd like to just reinforce the point I touched on a little earlier, which is a mobile DRAM part is not necessarily perishable to a PC DRAM part and vice versa. So as we look at the overall market, both mobile DRAM and PC DRAM are pretty healthy right now. But having said that, as you think about the market conditions, even though the PC unit growth is not -- has been projected to be low single digit to flat year-over-year, it's in pretty good balance right now. The PC market is not oversupplied as we sit here today in March. And so and the mobile market is pretty hot. But we're watching that balance because as manufacturers we have to call it right to keep the balance in good favor and that's what I think helping us both in the PC space. It\u2019s not that end user demand for PCs are up, it's just the economics of supply and demand are providing a pretty favorable business for us in PC.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","And if you could help me understand with Haswell coming up, is there another SKU thing (avenue) in terms of maybe DDR3 to DDR4? Or how should we look at the timing of Haswell and what that means for you in terms of picking the right SKU?","Mark Adams","I think we will just continue to work with our customers to work on adoption. We get a little concerned when we try to think too much about what's out in the press and the marketing of these types of technologies. It's really about customer adoptions and manufacturing output aligned to overall demand there. We have got qualified DDR4 product out there to Intel and others (inaudible).","Kipp Bedard","With that, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question for today's event will come from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus","Hello, this is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. Thank you for taking may call. What are your expectations for gross margin between the various segments of specialty DRAM? Do you expect these will equalize in the longer term or remain stratified in some way?","Mark Durcan","Well good question. I guess to Ron's earlier comments, we generally have a difficult time ultimately predicting ASPs which obviously are 50% of the impact to gross margin. So, maybe I'll just end the call or give you one more chance with questions without trying to lead you to gross margins particularly. We do have a few views but maybe I'll just let that for market speculation for now.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus","Okay. And regarding Inotera, do you have the flexibility to run different types of specialty DRAM within that agreement or is there any reason this stays tied to the PC area?","Mark Adams","No, we can use that capacity as we see fit.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus","Okay. One final thought if I could squeeze it in, does the new Inotera agreement change the equity method treatment in the income statement or does that remain the same?","Ronald Foster","Dean, this is Ron. It remains the same. We're about a 40% owner and we take 40% of it on our equity line.","Kipp Bedard","Thank you, Dean. Really appreciate it.

For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. Top line results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC segment and the mobile qualifications we discussed last quarter. With recent data points indicating some improvement in channel pricing, an expectation of finalizing our mobile qualifications and continued progress on our technology and operational milestones, we remain confident about our opportunities. Today, I would like to provide a brief overview of our progress in each of the businesses and Ernie will cover other business unit performance details.","In our Compute and Networking business unit, we returned to revenue growth despite pricing pressure in the client segment. This was driven by the ongoing ramp of our 20-nanometer products, which exceeded 25-nanometer shipments on a bit basis for the first time. We enjoyed continued 20-nanometer qualifications across all CMB market segments led by our 8-gigabit DDR4 product in enterprise, cloud and client. In May, NVIDIA launched the world\u2019s fastest consumer graphics card designed with Micron\u2019s GDDR5 X. We are excited about the prospects for this high-performance memory product. In enterprise and cloud, we saw initial customer announcements based on our NVDIMM product offering with high-performance persistent memory.","Turning to our Mobile business unit, our results continue to be impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. We are ramping the output of these products throughout the quarter and into fiscal Q1 2017. We anticipate continued demand growth in mobile market in the fourth quarter in terms of both NAND and LP DRAM.","In our Embedded business unit, the automotive segment delivered record revenue, driven by volume increases in DDR3 and increasing density mix in the eMMC. Density activity remains strong with recent qualifications of automotive consumer and connected home applications. In the consumer MCP business, we saw some recovery, but we expect to continue into fiscal Q4 aligning with seasonal demand.","And finally, our Storage business unit is in the midst of refreshing its SSD portfolio with a higher capacity 3D NAND memory technology. We also introduced Micron Accelerated Solutions, which are enabled by our enterprise SSDs and advanced DRAM, integrating compute and storage to improve efficiency and performance in a variety of storage applications. And we announced our new 110 SATA client SSDs, leveraging triple levels cell 3D NAND for class leading performance and power efficiency.","To summarize, our leading edge technology deployment continues to progress throughout manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND and we are on track with our bit growth and cost reduction targets. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive improvement in our competitive position in the rest of 2016 and beyond.","Turning to the memory industry more generally, we believe that the DRAM industry supply growth will be in the low to mid 20% range in 2016, which is consistent with our prior commentary. If wafer output declines in the latter half of the year as some parties have forecast, we would expect to exit the year on a slower run-rate and 2017 bit supply growth could be in the mid to high-teens. This compares to our long-term bit demand forecast in the low to mid-20% range. The significant improvements we are seeing in channel pricing are not currently impacting other segments. And as a result, we continue to take a conservative view of the market environment.","For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid 30% to low 40% range with a similar range in 2017 as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. Over the last several quarters, we have experienced strong demand coupled with aggressive pricing as suppliers have been driving to increased penetration rates and densities. Similar to DRAM, the current channel pricing environment appears to be improving, but has not yet significantly impacted across other segments. Our long-term bit demand forecast is in the low 40% range as lower cost and higher performance 3D NAND solutions enter the market.","From an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key priorities. For DRAM, we successfully achieved our targeted 20-nanometer crossover during fiscal Q3 and also enabled our 1X node in manufacturing. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer DRAM in volume starting in 2017. We are forecasting \u2013 we are still forecasting Micron\u2019s fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth in the 28% to 30% range, which is likely above the market. We achieved 22% bit growth in fiscal Q3 and expect even stronger bit growth in Q4. In light of current market conditions, we had no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity. As noted above, we are migrating to advanced technology nodes in order to achieve cost reductions and adjust higher density designs for mobile, cloud and enterprise segments.","For NAND, we continue to make great progress on our Gen 1 3D NAND and are reaching maturity yields ahead of expectations. We still expect to achieve 3D bit crossover by this fall, which will allow us to take advantage of the cost benefits that this technology provides. Our second generation 3D product is also on track with initial production this quarter. Equally exciting is that we expect TLC to be the majority of our 3D bit output within the next few quarters. In aggregate, we are forecasting Micron\u2019s fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be somewhat below the market in 2016 and somewhat above the market in 2017.","TLC enabled 3D NAND technology is a big step forward and a significant driver relative to the progress we expect to make in our NAND business. This technology progress must be complemented by enabling product solutions for key storage and mobile segments. We have outlined the storage product roadmap, which includes our recently announced client SSDs, followed by cloud drives later this year and enterprise solutions early next year. We are also evaluating a number of mobile product opportunities for 3D NAND in 2017.","Relative to 3D XPoint, we are working with market enablers across a number of market segments and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron\u2019s future success with revenue in 2017 and beyond. Micron has a committed focus on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products for our customers. While we haven\u2019t finalized our fiscal year 2017 business plan, we are approaching that plan with prudence and conservatism and carefully reviewing our capital investments and projected operating cash flows to ensure the appropriate balance.","Now, I would like to turn it over to Ernie.","Ernie Maddock","Thanks Mark. I will start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter.","DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile was in the mid 20% range. The PC segment represented about 25%. The server business was in the low 20% range. And specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high 20% range.","In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation; Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 55%. Mobile and SSDs each represented approximately 13%. And as a reminder, eMCPs are accounted for in the Mobile segment. The automotive, industrial, multi market and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range.","Moving on, I will share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. Micron\u2019s compute and networking business unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.09 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter, primarily driven by our 20-nanometer shipment growth across all segments and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $63 million or 6% of revenue. In the Enterprise segment, demand for our 20-nanometer 32 gigabit DDR4 RDAM was driven by the launch of Intel\u2019s latest server platform. We also saw solid growth in the Cloud segment with continued transition to DDR4. In graphics, we saw strong growth driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products and are approaching a seasonally strong period for graphics applications, including virtual reality and expect good performance from this segment for the next quarter. In networking our business was somewhat flat, however we made significant progress enabling our 20-nanometer products and also announced our eUSB 3.0 solution.","Finally, within the client segment, we continued enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer, 4 gigabit DDR3 and 8 gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs. In Micron\u2019s mobile business unit, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $561 million, up 12% from the prior quarter, as we continue to ramp 20-nanometer LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. While the low density eMCP market is still under pressure, a move to higher density designs in FQ 4 and early FY \u201817 should help stabilize and improve this segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $17 million or 3% of revenue.","We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. This work will allow us to more fully ramp our 20-nanometer mobile products in fiscal Q4 and into next year. Both LPDRAM and NAND content continued to increase in mobile devices, which when combined with even modest unit growth, will result in very solid bit consumption. In our embedded business, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $487 million, up 6% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating income of $107 million or 22% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by continued strength in the automotive and consumer segments, offset by softness in the industrial multi-market segment.","In our Automotive segment, we achieved record revenue increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-on-year. We continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC applications that include infotainment, instrument cluster and advanced driver assist systems and continued to see strong demand from our EMEA customers which was more recently complemented by growth in Korea and demand recovery in North America. Our portfolio of leading edge solutions is enabling major 2018 platform automotive design wins. Our industrial multi-market business declined 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to global market softness in the manufacturing infrastructure segment. However, we continue to see healthy demand for our NOR and NAND based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules.","Our consumer and connected home revenue was up 3% quarter-over-quarter with some softness in the set-top box business, offset by strong demand for NAND and LPDRAM MCPs to support action camera and home automation applications. As we enter into a seasonally strong period, we expect demand continue to grow. Customers are also beginning to design and ramp our 20-nanometer DDR4 products into set-top box applications. Micron storage business unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $719 million, down 20% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $62 million or 9% of revenue.","As we transition to lower cost 3D NAND products, we continue to optimize our product mix. In clients and consumer SSD, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 20% as we reduced production of planar NAND based SSDs while ramping volume production of 3D NAND based SATA and PCIE clients and consumer SSDs. These new products will enable the company to enhance its competitive position. In the Enterprise and Data Center SSD segments consecutive quarter bits sold were down 10%. As we have previously noted, our 3D NAND solutions will improve our product portfolio in this segment, enabling us to participate more significantly in this important growth business for the company.","Now looking at the company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, which was near the midpoint of our guided range and roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by decreases in selling prices while trade NAND shipments declined as we are in the middle of a significant conversion from planar to the 3D NAND. Gross margin for the quarter was 17% within our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $79 million or $0.08 per share, slightly better than the midpoints of our guided range. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Taken together, these two items represent $0.05 per share for the recently completed quarter.","Now let\u2019s look at results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the second quarter as a result of the 22% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by lower selling prices. As the results of our 20-nanometer ramp and ongoing mobile qualification timeline, DRAM finished goods inventory increased during the quarter. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter decreased approximately two percentage points to 18%, as decreases in ASPs outpaced significant cost reductions. Our non-volatile trade revenue decreased 15% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a 10% decrease in bit shipments combined with a 6% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 17% as ASP reductions outpaced cost per bit reductions. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $523 million below our guided range due to the reversal of accrued cost for variable compensation plans, which were suspended in the third quarter.","The company generated operating cash flow of $389 million and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.7 billion. Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.7 billion and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion net of partner contributions. During the quarter, we received approximately $2 billion from the issuance of secured notes and an additional $114 million in equipment financing. Also, we resolved the long outstanding tax matter, which resulted in a $52 million benefit to the tax line. This benefit was offset by the write-off of a related $30 million receivable that was reflected as non-operating expense. In the third quarter, we also acquired Photronics interest in our captive mass operations for $93 million resulting in 100% ownership of the mask operations.","Moving on to our guidance for the fourth quarter, on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 15.5% to 18%, operating expenses between $580 million and $630 million and operating loss ranging between $135 million and $55 million and an EPS loss ranging between $0.24 and $0.16 per share based on 1.036 billion diluted shares. Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction that we previously shared as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND production. In recognition of the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on the company\u2019s key priorities, we plan to implement the cost saving program, which we expect will save the company approximately $80 million per quarter in fiscal 2017. The savings will result from a combination of our more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a material number of open headcount requisition and a workforce reduction in certain areas of the business, as well as other non-headcount related spending reductions. About half of these savings will appear in the gross margin line of the company while the remainder will be reflected in operating expenses. These savings are baseline against our previously planned 2017 fiscal spend levels.","We expect to take reserves approximating $70 million for the cost of this program, the majority of which will occur in fiscal Q4 with the remainder in the early part of fiscal 2017. As we complete our fiscal 2017 planning process, we are mindful of the need to effectively balance period spending, CapEx and free cash flow and we continue to explore other opportunities to improve the company\u2019s financial performance. Finally, at this time, we don\u2019t have any new information to share relative to Inotera. As we stated in our press release, the transaction will not be closing in mid July and we expect to provide an update during the latter part of the calendar year.","With that, I will turn it back to Mark.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we continue to navigate challenging market conditions, but remain confident in the long-term health of the industry and the company\u2019s strategy to improve our relative competitive position. The decision to implement cost reduction initiatives is always difficult and is never made without thoughtful consideration about the short-term and the long-term impacts. However, to ensure that we can continue to place emphasis on our most important company priorities, we believe the steps Ernie outlined are prudent and will help deliver the best long-term results for the company.","I would like to take a moment to thank our customers, partners, shareholders and team members for their continued support. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Yes, hi guys. Just a couple of questions here on the DRAM side, obviously, good bit growth there. But how do you \u2013 what\u2019s the mix of 20-nanometer that you are shipping now and how do you see that as you progress through the August quarter? Do you see further cost reductions there? Thanks. I have one follow-up.","Mark Durcan","Yes. 20-nanometer is the majority of the bits that we are shipping now. And when we talked in our prepared remarks about the strong bit growth above Q3 levels, you saw what the relative growth was in Q3 and you can assume it will be a little bit north of that as we look at fiscal Q4.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And on the 3D NAND side, obviously, it looks like bit growth was a little light obviously because of the transition. What\u2019s your mix of 3D NAND that you are shipping now? And when do you see the transition and the bit growth start to open up for you on the NAND side?","Mark Durcan","Yes. I would say low double-digits today. As we commented \u2013 as we get into the back half of the calendar year, we expect a crossover. So, that\u2019s coming pretty soon. So, it\u2019s a pretty significant ramp from here over the next couple of quarters.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And obviously, you guys are giving a blind estimate on the gross margin now, which is great. As you look at your mix with 20-nanometer costs coming down and 3D NAND PNC starting to ship, any thoughts on where do you see those margins start to bottom out? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","We typically don\u2019t comment on margins, because it\u2019s a function of our pricing environment just moving around on us everyday. And so really what we have said is that the cost curves that we articulated in our Analyst Day are still legitimate. As you can imagine, when we do 3D crossover and NAND in the fall, that\u2019s when you expect to see the accelerated cost reductions begin to occur there. And on the DRAM side, with the kind of bit growth that we delivered in fiscal Q3 as well as what we are forecasting for fiscal Q4, you can get some idea of what the cost reductions would be there.","Vijay Rakesh","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Ernie, maybe just a follow-on to that margin question and I appreciate that margins are a function of pricing, which is hard to predict. But you have got a lot of elements moving in the right direction. Revenue is growing sequentially into the fiscal fourth quarter. You have got 20-nanometer mix. You have got more mobile. NAND has started to turn your way and yet you have got gross margins that are likely going to be down sequentially. Can you help me understand just kind of some of the factors around mix that are in play and kind of the narrative that we were hoping for is that this quarter, the May quarter and the August quarter would start to show some tangible evidence of you kind of closing the relative cost gap to some of your peers? And just given the gross margin guidance, it looks like that\u2019s not happening and I am trying to figure out why?","Mark Durcan","Maybe, John, maybe I can take that one instead of Ernie. Again, on the pricing environment as you noted, we are seeing there is obviously encouraging things going on in the channel. Before we start making that into any sort of guidance we would give, we want to actually see that as it moves through other end market segments and out in the contract pricing etcetera, etcetera. So, really this was a question about the tailwinds we have and I think you did a nice job articulating for us. We have got \u2013 I think we have done a good job on the 20-nanometer ramp and we will continue to see some improvement for that as we move through the next quarter. We articulated pretty strong bit growth moving forward in both DRAM and in particular maybe a couple of quarters out in NAND as we really see that transition kick in and the 3D TLC part of that transition kick in. So, we have got a lot of good tailwinds. We also articulated we are making lot of good progress on qualifying and re-segmenting those more advanced technology nodes in the right market segments. And we do believe that you will see progress relative to our competition in terms of how our margins move. We never know exactly what they are going to do and it\u2019s tough for us to predict what their results are going to look like given the pricing environment.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, Mark. I appreciate it. And then Ernie, maybe if I follow on just on the OpEx guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, a little bit higher than we thought. Can you help us understand are there some period expenses that are coming in? And then as you talk about the restructuring and the cost savings given that you kind of have that cost gap and you had a lot of initiatives on your plate for investing, how do we get comfortable that you are kind of taking cost out of the right areas and yet still investing in areas you need to invest?","Ernie Maddock","Sure. So, to the first part of your question, there are some very significant pre-qual expenses that we expect to incur in Q4 that are influencing the guidance that we have provided for the quarter\u2019s OpEx. And then relative to the cost reduction, the only comfort perhaps I would offer you, which I hope is very strong comfort is that we actually think very carefully about what we are doing here and the decisions that we made with respect to the cost savings program were deliberated, very thoughtfully debated. And at the end, we believe we are the right balance to both help improve the financial performance of the company while at the same time not jeopardizing any of the company\u2019s potential in terms of revenue opportunities.","Mark Durcan","John, maybe I can add one point there, just so everyone on the call is clear, I know you are. The preproduction R&D class Ernie is referencing are really associated with a lot of new products in qual with these technology nodes that are now ramped. And some of those are sort of costs that flow through the R&D now as opposed to directly on the cost flow and inventory.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities.","Romit Shah","Yes. Thanks Mark. You mentioned that channel pricing has improved. At what point would you start to see that show up in contract and in some of your other businesses, because it looks like just based on the guidance for August that you are not expecting the overall pricing environment better relative to May?","Mark Durcan","Well, it\u2019s a very dynamic environment. So, again, we want to make sure we are giving you what we believe is realistic guidance and guidance that is achievable. And we are going to have to see what plays out in the markets over time. When contract \u2013 when spot pricing starts moving, that\u2019s a great indicator of where the markets might go, but what has to happen obviously is there has to be enough liquidity in the market that can carry through into larger volume quarters associated with contract market. And inventory has to burn off. And we are seeing good indications of those types of things, but we need to make sure the pudding is fully baked before we serve it.","Romit Shah","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the pre-call expenses that are boosting OpEx this quarter, is that sort of more one-time in nature or do you expect expenses to sort of remain elevated through the course of the year as you ramp these new products?","Ernie Maddock","Well, certainly, they will occur as there is a concentration of new products. So you shouldn\u2019t expect that they are going to occur each quarter. And I would tell you then in Q4, they are particularly high relative to what we have seen over the recent history as a reflection of what Mark said. But it is likely that some time during the course of 2017, you are also going to see these occur as we release new products. But again, we see a particularly high concentration in FQ4 \u201816.","Romit Shah","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from Cowen and Company.","Tim Arcuri","Thanks a lot. I guess I had two questions, first of all, the NAND bits are really moving around a lot, obviously given the planar to the 3D move, so maybe you can hold our hand a little bit and on the 3D transition because it does sort of look like there has been some issues in the 3D transition looking at the bits and maybe also talk about what the bit outlook is for August in NAND to just sort give us some comfort that you are sort of getting through this transition?","Ernie Maddock","So Tim relative to \u2013 I will take the second part of your question first and then we will circle back around to the first. The stake in the ground is we have said a few things, which were actually we reiterated today that would kind of be in the opposite direction of thinking there were problems with our 3D NAND transition, right. We are seeing mature yields occurring at rates that are slightly faster than we anticipated. We had originally probably six months ago talked about big crossover for 3D at the end of the year. Today, we reiterated again that that was going to occur in the fall. So a pull forward of a couple of months. And so we are not going to give you a bit guidance for the August quarter, but we do think that these data points will hopefully give you comfort that in fact, the transition really is occurring slightly more rapidly than we have expected it to occur.","Mark Durcan","The thing I would add to that Tim, is keep in mind we have also talked about the fact that we want to deliver more of our NAND bits in actual solutions to the customer. And as we do that, there is a natural tendency to stretch out the supply chain in aggregate and some lengthening of the total manufacturing cycle time as we move through that transition. So part of this I think is also reflective of the fact that we are making some fairly significant progress relative to like getting these bits into the types of end products that we want to deliver to the customer.","Ernie Maddock","I think one final point that may be also contributing to the overall impression is we do see planar bits coming down fairly significantly as you move away from that planar SSD markets that we have sold into in the past. So there are many dynamics sort of at play here relative to what comes out as an aggregate bit number.","Tim Arcuri","Got it. And then just as the follow-up to that. Ernie, you talked at the Analyst Day, I think you said that $800 million of the CapEx this year would be for fab shell spending. So that sort of net of the partner contribution you would be sort of in the 4 to 4.5 range. And so \u2013 I am sorry, net of the partner contribution and also net of the fab shell spend would be in the sort of 4 to 4.5 range and so I am just kind of wondering, as you look to next year and I don\u2019t \u2013 and I am not asking for guidance, but I am just wondering how you think about the maintenance CapEx level of the company given some of these initiatives you have in DRAM and also in 3D NAND, how do you sort of think about how to balance that? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Well, you really asked kind of two different questions, right, how do we balance and obviously, the balance has come in as we think about the aggregate business for the company and the cash flow that we are planning to generate and a number of other factors. As we look at maintenance CapEx, we sort of said that we were normalized in that low $4 billion range ex-Inotera and we wouldn\u2019t move away from that in a very substantial way as we are thinking about things today, bearing in mind that we are still in the midst of a ramp of 3D in the Singapore fab. So it isn\u2019t exactly a normalized environment for us. Even taking out the shell, we are still outfitting that shell with productive capacity.","Tim Arcuri","Got it, okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Thank you very much. For the second generation 3D NAND, when you hit crossover in the fall for 3D NAND, will this all be on second generation technology or will it be first generation and what\u2019s the difference in layer count between first and second generation, please?","Mark Durcan","So David, it will be primarily significant majority of that. In fact, almost all of it will still be Gen 1. Gen 2 we start to see significant output in the second calendar quarter into the summer of 2017. And we haven\u2019t said what the layer count does, but we have indicated that it\u2019s roughly a 30% cost reduction moving from Gen 1 to Gen 2 and it is roughly double the bit.","David Wong","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes in the line of Chris Hemmelgarn from Barclays.","Chris Hemmelgarn","Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess first of all, building on David\u2019s question, as you are seeing 3D ramp across the industry, how do you view your competitive position and at your Analyst Day, you laid out some beliefs that you are going to have cost leadership, is that holding as you are seeing the competition ramp?","Mark Durcan","This is Mark. Yes, absolutely. We are very happy with the way the ramp is going. We are very happy with the technology we are delivering and its ability to scale going forward. We think it\u2019s the best solution in the industry for almost every end market application.","Chris Hemmelgarn","Okay. And I guess to the harder question, what needs to happen for you guys to get back to sustain profitability, I mean I applaud the restructuring efforts, but I look at the savings you have announced and that fall short of the wash as you put up for the last two quarters and what you guided to the next quarter, are you confident these changes are going to be enough to get you back to profitability next year?","Mark Durcan","Well, we think we are doing all the right things. And we think we were making a lot of good progress on a relative competitive position on technology. But the products are all coming along nicely now and the qualifications are progressing well. So there is always the wildcard around ASPs, but we think we are making very significant progress and we think we will see that every quarter as we move forward, you will be able measure us versus our competition. And hopefully confirm that we are doing all the right things and exactly when that results in profitability, we can\u2019t tell you, but we think its coming.","Chris Hemmelgarn","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my question. On the mobile side, as you start getting more qualification on the LPDDR3 and DDR4, are you expecting that \u2013 I guess what percentage of your revenue will be those products versus eMCP and what is it today?","Mark Durcan","Let me see it if I can find those numbers. I don\u2019t have them right in front of me. For the mobile DRAM portfolio generally, eMCP probably represents...","Ernie Maddock","Well, I will jump in real quick, Mark. So, the way we break it out Kevin, is mobile DRAM discrete is reported in our DRAM business. And that\u2019s about mid-20% of our total DRAM. Our eMCPs are reported in our NAND reporting segment. And we said mobile was in the mid-teens percent of the NAND business, mid to low \u2013 low to mid teens.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay. Maybe as you ship more of the LPDDR3 and 4s, are you expecting that your average selling price would increase?","Ernest Maddock","Again, it\u2019s really challenging to give you a forecast of what\u2019s going to happen with the pricing environment. But in terms of aggregate revenues, we would expect it, as we move through these qualifications, that you are going to see the mobile business maintain or slightly improve in terms of a percentage of its overall revenue to the business. And as we noted in our comments, right, as we see eMCP market moving to higher density, we think that, that will be sort of a starting point for an improvement in that aggregate market, which has been weak actually in the last couple of quarters and that\u2019s a quarter or so off as we roll into calendar 2017.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question on the mobility qualifications side, how much I guess is the uncertainty around timing there whether it\u2019s the month of August or September, October impacting your gross margin guide? And then as part of that, how should we think about the incremental gross margins as you start selling down your inventory going forward once we do get to qualified?","Ernest Maddock","So, C.J., it\u2019s Ernie. We are pretty clear on the qualification timeline. There is more uncertainty around the timing of shipments, because at the end of the day that is going to be a function of each of those customers sort of current inventory dynamics with respect to the inventories they have on hand, their success in the marketplace and how they want to position their inventory. And in addition to that, we are going to have as we already talked about significant quarter-on-quarter growth in production, some of which is directed toward that mobile market, because we believe that it\u2019s fairly strong. So, mobile in general has a better gross margin profile than the aggregate business. So, as that product flows through, although there will be some early pressure as a result of that inventory having been built at a time when costs weren\u2019t fully baked as a result of the volume ramp eventually it will flow through into the margin profile of the company.","C.J. Muse","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess as a follow-up when you think about your 3D NAND cost structure, curious how you would compare that today versus the price leader in planar NAND and when you think you will crossover? Is that Gen 1 when you are fully ramped at high volume or is that more Gen 2 in the summertime next year?","Mark Durcan","Yes, I think it\u2019s probably most closely timed to an increase in our TLC mix, which is probably a couple of quarters out and then we will get a second surge sort of in calendar Q2 and Q3 of next year as the Gen 2 kicks in, in a significant way. But again, we think we will be the leader as we fully implement Gen 2 and TLC.","C.J. Muse","Great. Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Yes, hi. Thank you. I wonder I just wanted to clarify when you talk about Q4 DRAM bit growth being better than Q3, that\u2019s sequential bit growth north of 20%. And I guess that then implies when you look at revenue not growing very much that ASPs are down similarly. I know you don\u2019t want to give a pricing forecast, but I just want to make sure I understand I am planning it hard to get to your revenue number with my pricing assumptions?","Mark Durcan","So, the first part of your assumption process, Joe, is correct. And again, we are not going to comment on ASPs.","Joe Moore","Okay. And then separately, can you talk about how the Inotera, the new pricing agreement factors into this? Is that a positive or a negative at this point relative to the old pricing agreement? And maybe if you could compare that versus a wholly owned situation if that deal in fact moves through? Just as any context you can give us around that dynamic?","Ernest Maddock","Sure. So, in the current pricing environment what we have contemplated as we look toward the Q4 is pretty much a wash to be honest with you, either way that the results to Micron would be roughly the same.","Joe Moore","Alright. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I am still a little bit unclear as to the gross margin decline or the slight gross margin decline in the August quarter given that we have seen some stabilization in DRAM and NAND prices starting kind of in the month of June, your 20-nanometer mix and your 3D NAND mix is moving higher. So, I would assume that your blended costs are coming down nicely. You mentioned other parts of the market that may not be participating on the pricing stabilization that we are seeing in the PC market. But if I look at the end market demand parameters, data center, networking fundamentals seem to be improving into the second half. Embedded fundamentals seem to be seasonally up. Can you guys just articulate like what segments are still showing aggressive pricing declines?","Mark Durcan","Yes. So, let me try to characterize that a little bit for you. So, it is important to recognize that these data points are really happening in real time. And as we look at how we actually entered this quarter, we were actually starting the quarter below the average of the prior quarter and we are now seeing some upward trends that are causing everyone to have the enthusiasm that we are talking about, but it is important to understand that what we have been reading about in the last two weeks has a) not impacted the entirety of the quarter and b) hasn\u2019t reflected itself yet as we look at forward pricing. And as Mark mentioned a couple of times, we really are wanting to provide prudent guidance in the context of an environment that\u2019s moving around very, very significantly. The other point I would make is it is absolutely true that we are seeing strong bit growth and cost reductions on the DRAM side. Remember that we said the majority of the NAND cost reductions occur as we achieve that big crossover, which is later in the fall of this year. So, we are getting quarter-on-quarter cost productions in NAND, but I think you might be perhaps pulling towards that bit crossover comment into the full quarter that we are coming up on and that\u2019s just not going to be the case.","Harlan Sur","Okay, appreciate the insights there. Maybe more of a product question for me next. I mean, if we include 2 in 1s, I think SSD and embedded NAND attach rates in notebook PCs are at or slightly above 50% now and continuing to climb. I think you guys had a target of having your 3D NAND base client SSD in the market in calendar Q3. Maybe if you can just give us an update there? And I think you guys also had a target to have your 3D NAND-based SATA solution, your high capacity drives for hyperscale drives starting in calendar Q4, if you could give us an update there as well? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Well, they are both in the market. And we are going to just have to see what the demand looks like, but so far we like the reaction we are seeing.","Harlan Sur","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Yes, thanks for taking my question. On the whole 3D NAND conversion, I just wanted to get a better understanding of in your estimation what would be more cost effective that the 3D on 32-layer versus the 20-nanometer that\u2019s currently on 2D NAND?","Mark Durcan","Definitely. The 3D 32-layer is cost advantaged relative to 20-nanometer, even 16-nanometer planar NAND. And we believe that as we move through time, the market is going to appreciate incremental value in 3D NAND bits as well.","Rajvindra Gill","But can you give us an idea in terms of if your 3D NAND is actually fitted for some of the applications as it will be available for applications such as mobile or embedded or cars?","Mark Durcan","Yes. We have a full product portfolio coming for 3D NAND that will address. And I think I mentioned this in my commentary we have 3D NAND products for consumer client datacenter and enterprise as well as evaluating mobile applications on a go forward basis.","Rajvindra Gill","Okay. And just last question on the mobile DRAM qualification issues, what specifically can you talk about it? Has there been quality issues with respect to your mobile DRAM, which is preventing you from getting qualified at certain customers and as a result losing market share to Samsung and\u2026.","Mark Durcan","You know I think we have gone through a very significant transition here, in some cases from 30-nanometer to 20-nanometer, in some cases from 25-nanometer to 20-nanometer. And from a timing perspective, in some cases, we were later with a particular either density or iode or interface that the customer is wanting. And so it\u2019s just a matter of working through that process and qualifying both products in the various fabs that we are ramping. So I don\u2019t think there is anything untoward or unusual in that process. It\u2019s just a matter of a fairly significant ramp across two high volume fabs and taking the time to qualify a full suite of products across all those technologies.","Rajvindra Gill","And if I could just squeeze one more, in terms of kind of competitively as it relates to your other major competitors moving to a smaller process node and you guys perhaps perpetually plan to catch-up in terms of process node transition, kind of what are some of the lessons you think you guys have kind of understood from the 20-nanometer transition and trying to rectify that when you go to the other process node transition, just in general any comments there would be helpful? Thank you very much.","Mark Durcan","Yes. So certainly, we think 3D NAND has gone very, very well for that. For us, that has been really a model, where we take technology, we have developed in fab 4 and move it into a consistent equipment set in a historically Micron environment, where the equipment all matches and things go very, very well. What we had experienced in 20-nanometer is we are matching at this set of equipment, given the Elpida acquisition. So we have got one full set in Hiroshima, one full set in the MMT fab in Taichung and a separate tool set in the Inotera fab. And that\u2019s just more complicated. And every time we make this transition, we get more and more of those tools aligned. And we feel like actually we are in pretty good shape now. And as we move to the 1X node beyond that, it\u2019s going to be a lot more seamless and a lot easier to execute on a go forward basis. So we are \u2013 we think we are the leader in 3D and we think we are getting closer in DRAM and 1X is coming along now running at sort of pre-production levels in both Hiroshima and Taichung.","Rajvindra Gill","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Mark I am just looking at your NAND gross margin, it\u2019s been below corporate average since mid-2013 and you have all of these new product qualification coming up, I am just wondering is there a strategic alternative here to make more it dramatic or to take a more dramatic action because it has been more than 2 years that NAND has been underperforming compared to the corporate average and in case these product qualifications don\u2019t go well is there alternative strategy here? And I have a follow-up.","Mark Durcan","We are always open to looking at lots of different ways to optimize the business for the shareholders. Having said that, we like our NAND position, we like the technology. The early feedback from the customers is they like what we are doing, they like not only the 3D technology, but the product portfolio. And we think we are making progress. So we are kind of encouraged with the progress we have been making. Yes, we completely \u2013 we have admitted for 18 months now that we completely missed the boat on planar TLC. We think we have taken significant steps to remedy that on a go forward basis. And we intend to do so. So we are going to play it out. And as we do that, we will look at lots of different strategic options for the DRAM business, just like we do for the \u2013 sorry, for the NAND business, just like we do for the DRAM business and 3D cost plans and all the other interesting new technologies we are developing.","Mehdi Hosseini","Anyway you could share with us qualitatively or big picture what some of those options are?","Mark Durcan","Well, I think we will just keep those to ourselves, Mehdi. But I think the main point I would want to make to you is we think it\u2019s important to have a diversified set of products or technologies to support memory system solutions for our customers. We think were in a strong position there. We like the growth profile associated with the non-volatile memory business generally and that includes not only NAND, not only 3D cross point business that we are currently developing, but also other advanced storage class memories we are working in. And we will look at lots of different ways of optimizing the value in all those different technologies. And we way may find different solutions in different segments, but we are always looking for those opportunities to create value added partnerships or new relationships.","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. And then quickly for Ernie, how should we think about working capital inventory and accounts receivable, it seems like at least on the inventory side, it may not come down significantly until February quarter, is that a fair assumption or not?","Ernie Maddock","I think it\u2019s reasonable to think about inventory being within a pretty narrow band for a couple of quarters. So I think that\u2019s a reasonable thing to think about. And obviously, we pay a lot of attention to working capital and tend to do so on a going forward basis and my statement about inventories was on a dollar basis. So obviously bits are going to move around as costs move around.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay. Thank you.","Ivan Donaldson","And operator I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird.","Tristan Gerra","Hi, good afternoon. You have mentioned on the call today that the 3D NAND cost structure is laying to the TLC mix and you have mentioned a two quarter out timeframe for that mix ramp, is that in line with the Q4, fiscal Q4 target in terms of cost improvement in your NAND business that you provided last quarter or was there a little bit of a change in terms of where you expect an inflection point in your cost structure in NAND flash?","Mark Durcan","No, there is no change. We are \u2013 I think we are pretty consistent. The fiscal Q1 is our crossover, is aligned with our crossover in the fall, what we talked about today, which is a little earlier than we had originally talked about. The 3D crossover comes a little bit later. And that drives a surge in the cost improvement, but not necessarily to drive the improvements that we have kind of outlined relative to our guidance.","Tristan Gerra","Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, any steps that you can talk about that you are taking to accelerate the node migration notably at Eldida?","Mark Durcan","The migration of DRAM from 20-nanometer to 1X?","Tristan Gerra","That\u2019s right.","Mark Durcan","We are not completely done with 20-nanometer there yet. But as I mentioned a minute ago, we have 1X running there. It\u2019s kind of where we have been doing our pilot line activity and we have transitioned, where we have transferred that technology into the Taichung fab and they are progressing with that. We wouldn\u2019t expect to see volume starts in either Eldida or Taichung until later this year.","Tristan Gerra","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of \u2013 I am sorry that does conclude our conference for today. And we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","Mark Durcan","Thank you everyone."],"15499":["Micron Technology, Inc.

Mark?","Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. We had another strong quarter benefiting from robust market demand as well as solid operational execution. We set a new record for revenue of over $4.2 billion for the quarter. Net income was $1.15 billion or $0.96 per diluted share. For the fiscal year 2014, we generated record revenue of $16.4 billion, record net income over $3 billion, and record free cash flow of $2.6 billion based on record operating cash flow of $5.7 billion less CapEx of $3.1 billion.","As we enter fiscal 2015, I'd like to touch on a few key areas of focus as well as provide a brief industry update. Ron Foster will follow with a financial summary and before turning to Q&A, we'll close our prepared comments with Mark Adams covering additional details of our operational performance and market conditions.","Beyond ongoing advanced component and technology development, we have three main operational focus areas for fiscal 2015. The first is technology deployment and includes continued 25-nanometer DRAM conversion and 20-nanometer DRAM ramp, completion of 16-nanometer planar NAND conversion and introduction of 3D NAND, TLC NAND deployment for cost sensitive applications and building out our capability to deliver advanced packaging solutions and controllers.","The second is optimizing manufacturing capacity, which includes improving our manufacturing efficiency through line balancing, cycle time, yield, and metrology initiatives, and managing our product mix in order to generate the best possible long-term margins and returns for our business.","And finally in 2015, we will focus on growing our memory systems and subsystem solutions, including expanding the market penetration and our offering breadth of our advanced bit addressable memory solutions, building additional storage solutions such as enterprise SSDs, and designing new and innovative mobile memory systems solutions.","As we outlined at our Analyst Day last month, fiscal 2015 CapEx is expected to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion. Roughly 30% of this CapEx will go towards non-supply expanding investments, including manufacturing efficiency improvements, emerging memories, backend capability and additional system manufacturing and engineering tooling to support system and subsystem level products. This compares to about 25% of our $3.1 billion CapEx bill in fiscal 2014, and highlights our belief that these investments, which are designed among other things to enhance our value-added product portfolio will generate some of the highest returns going forward.","In terms of the more traditional investments in memory process technology, DRAM will represent about 50% and NAND will represent about 20% of our total CapEx in 2015. This compares to roughly 45% and 30% to 35% respectively in 2014. We expect the bit growth we generated from technology in calendar 2015 to be in line or below the market for both DRAM and NAND. Our big growth profile is reflective of the strategy to grow the mix of premium and value added products while maintaining and improving operational efficiency and costs. While this will lead to less pure supply growth, we expect we will generate more attractive and sustainable margins over time with this approach.","Our long-term outlook for the memory industry remains favorable. For DRAM, we are forecasting 2014 industry supply growth of around 30%. In 2015, we expect DRAM industry bit growth in the low to mid 20% range, and beyond 2015 we expect industry supply growth to slow somewhat ranging from the high teens to mid-20s. Part of this encouraging supply trend is due to the fact that 20-nanometer and sub 20-nanometer process technology ramps significantly reduce the wafer production for existing clean room space.","We believe the DRAM industry; supply demand balance will continue to be favorable for the foreseeable future. Demand elasticity has declined from historical levels, and cost per bit is no longer the major factor driving demand growth. For NAND, we are projecting industry supply growth in the high 30% to low 40% range for 2014. This includes an increase in industry wafer production of just over 10%, with the remaining supply growth coming from technology.","We expect 2015 industry supply growth to be in the high 30% to 40% -- to mid-40% range, beyond 2015 when 3D becomes more prevalent in the market, supply growth will depend on new capacity investment. Although 3D technology drives a significant increase in bits per wafer, without capacity investment, this is offset by substantial decreases in wafer output per square foot of clean room space.","The demand profile matches up well with the existing supply growth rate and we also believe that due to elasticity of demand for NAND and client enterprise storage applications, the demand growth could be significantly higher over time. At Micron, we will continue to manage our NAND business, focused on long-term returns.","I want to congratulate the whole Micron team for a tremendous year. We look forward to building on the success in 2015. The memory industry continues to look very attractive. We've never been better positioned to deliver differentiated value for our customers and shareholders.","I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before turning for Q&A. Ron?","Ron Foster","Thanks Mark. Our fourth quarter 2014 and fiscal year ended on August 28. We posted to our Web site a file containing the financial information I will cover including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for fiscal 2014, the fourth quarter, as well as guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2015.","For fiscal 2014, we posted record revenue and net income, as Mark mentioned, with net income of $3 billion or $2.54 per diluted share on net sales of $16.4 billion. This compares to the fiscal 2013 results of net income of $1.2 billion on net sales of $9.1 billion. Recall that the 2013 results include the $1.5 billion non-cash gain in the fourth quarter from the purchase accounting for Elpida and Rexchip, which we now refer to as Micron Memory Japan or MMJ and Micron Memory Taiwan or MMT.","The results for fiscal 2014 reflect continued healthy market conditions, particularly for DRAM products and our focus on maximizing long-term returns in the business. Non-GAAP net income increased significantly comparing 2014 to 2013.","Now focusing on the fourth-quarter results, we posted net income of $1.150 billion or $0.96 per diluted share on net sales of $4.2 billion. The fourth quarter gross margin of 33% includes a $66 million charge associated with a patent license with Tessera. The go-forward license will have cost of goods sold charges that are not anticipated to have a material impact to any future quarterly period.","In addition, gross margin in the fourth quarter was adversely affected by $38 million from a last time sale of legacy architecture mobile PCM or phase change memory products which was mentioned last quarter as part of our guidance. Without these two items, gross margin for the fourth quarter would have been higher by approximately 2.5 percentage points.","On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter was $961 million, or $0.82 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments netted to a reduction of income of $189 million or $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter and included the following. The charge related to the Tessera license mentioned previously, restructured charges in the quarter of $22 million which were primarily related to employee termination benefits from a workforce reduction in Italy.","Amortization of debt discounts and other costs of $37 million in the fourth quarter includes imputed interest on our convertible notes and the discount on the MMJ installment debt. The loss on restructure of debt of $17 million related to primarily to the repurchase and conversion of convertible notes in the fourth quarter including mark-to-market adjustments of the 2031 B-notes to be settled in the first quarter of this year.","Non-cash taxes from the MMJ operations were $118 million benefit in the fourth quarter, which includes a benefit from a change in the estimated utilization of net operating loss carryforwards for MMJ and MMT. A couple of significant gains recognized in the fourth quarter also adjusted out of the non-GAAP results as follows. A $93 million gain was recognized as a result of Inotera's equity GDR offering in May that was executed at a price above the carrying value of our investment.","This gain was recognized in the fourth quarter, since we account for our equity method results from Inotera with a two-month lag. And $190 million gain was recognized from the sale of our remaining interest in Aptina to ON Semiconductor. The transaction closed just shortly before the end of the fiscal year. And finally, there is a 27 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the fourth quarter of $31.91.","In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect the following non-GAAP adjustments. Between $40 million and $45 million for amortization of debt discounts on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt, we are anticipating a Q1 net loss on restructure of debt of approximately $25 million as the conversions of the 2031 B-notes are completed.","Non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million in the first quarter. Also, the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Please refer to the convertible debt dilution table included in the earnings call data file posted on our Web site.","Let's turn now to our results by technology and other guidance for the first quarter. On a consolidated basis we are guiding total revenue for the first quarter in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.7 billion. Recalling our first quarter of fiscal 2015, we will include an extra week due to the periodic adjustment of our weekly fiscal calendar to coincide with the end of August year-end, which will have a direct impact on operating expenses; however, revenue may vary differently.","Turning now to DRAM, DRAM revenue increased nearly 5% compared to the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in bit sales volume and stable ASPs. DRAM gross margin remained in the high 30% range, with flat cost per bit. Cost per bit would have been down 2%, absent the effect of the Tessera license. Our reported income from equity method investments for the fourth quarter was $119 million substantially all of which is attributable to Inotera.","DRAM gross margins for the first quarter using quarter to date ASP and projected mix for the quarter should be up a couple of points compared to Q4 based on bit production up mid to high single digits, ASPs up low single-digits, and cost per bit down low single-digits which includes the effect from the Tessera license in Q4. Key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the first quarter are continued favorable market conditions, like for like pricing, generally flat to up for PC and server DRAM and trending up for mobile DRAM, which Mark will comment on in a few minutes.","On the Trade NAND side revenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter with a 13% increase in bit sales volume partially offset by 6% decrease in the average selling price. Trade NAND gross margin was in the mid-20% range down approximately 3 percentage points with ASP declines outpacing cost per bit reductions of 2%. However, absent the effect of the Tessera license agreement, cost per bit would have been down approximately 5%.","Trade NAND gross margins for first quarter using quarter to date ASP and projected mix for the quarter, are expected to be down 1 to 2 percentage points compared to Q4, based on bit production is expected to be up high teens, ASPs down low to mid-single digits, and cost per bit down low single digits compared to Q4, which includes the effect of the Tessera license.","Key trends for Q1 affecting this guidance are generally stable NAND market conditions, and also, strong growth in client and enterprise SSD volumes with more pronounced price competition and initially higher BOM costs that impact margins.","Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, SG&A expense in Q1 is expected to be up slightly from the normalized weekly run rate from the fourth quarter. R&D expense in the first quarter and fiscal 2015 is expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter, even when normalized for the 14th week in Q1, due to higher volumes of development wafers processed for new technologies and new solutions development.","The company generated $1.35 billion in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter and ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and marketable investments approximately $1.8 billion increase over the fiscal year. Expenditures of property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year were $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion respectively.","Our cash tax rate continues to be in the low single-digit range at current profit levels. While GAAP taxes are expected to run in mid-single digits this year. Throughout this past fiscal year we've been in the market in each open trading window revamping the capital structure of the company with the focus on reducing dilution associated with our convertible notes. We've been repurchasing or converting convertible notes with cash and replacing them with high-yield notes including the fourth quarter repurchase of the 2032 notes and issuance of $1.15 billion and 5.5% notes. Approximately 90% of the free cash flow generated during the year was used for these dilution management activities.","In addition, in the fourth quarter, we used $339 million of cash to prepay certain foreign loans and leases. We have indicated the pending conversion of the remaining 2031 B-notes will be for cash, resulting in an outflow in Q1 of approximately $390 million of cash.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.","Mark Adams","Thanks, Ron. I will begin, as usual, with a review of our Q4 operating performance by business units, as well as share commentary on market insights, key segment trends and memory industry dynamics.","Our Computing and Networking Business Unit referred to as CNBU, had another strong quarter, achieving $1.9 billion in revenues in Q4. DRAM pricing in CNBU was up quarter-on-quarter, highlighting a continued healthy demand supply balance in computing, server networking and enterprise market segments. On the client side, we continued to receive strong demand signals from our PC customer base. We locked our pricing through the end of our calendar Q3 and with our three largest OEM customers, and have received interest in locking prices again for Q4. We achieved record revenue and bit shipments in our server segment.","Server DRAM growth is being driven by customers adding more memory per system. In fiscal year 2014, we saw a 40% year-on-year growth in DRAM per server, while ASPs in the segment had strengthened over the same period. This growth in server based memory is based on increasing server workloads, continuing to require DRAM performance and density and is a great example of a high-growth segment with a demand profile that is not sensitive to price.","Networking revenues in DRAM were up 19%, quarter-over-quarter. Demand for our networking products remained strong driven by LTE build-out in China and other emerging markets. Next year, we expect to see significantly more 4G handset sold utilizing this capacity, which continues to drive higher memory content per phone. I will address this more in the mobile section. The U.S. will fully be engaged in a 4G LTE build-out throughout calendar 2015 and as a result, we anticipate seeing continued strong demand in this area.","Lastly, our Graphics business continues to flourish and increasingly contributes to an uplift in ASPs and margin. We're starting to see strong gaming consoles demand ahead of the holidays and remain optimistic for a good quarter and graphics. We are pleased with the progress on the technology innovation front in DRAM. We commenced early DDR4 shipments in Q4 as Intel officially launched DDR4 enabled platforms in early September, and Micron is validated with their entire 4 gigabit based portfolio.","I want to recognize our R&D organization, our engineering teams and BU product development organization for positioning Micron as first to market and what we feel could be a strong value-added business. We are in qualification at major OEMs for both server and client opportunities for DDR4. We anticipate a significant price for those customers looking to differentiate their solutions.","We have also launched into the non-volatile DIMM category providing for DRAM content back-up with dramatically improved reliability. Our NVDIMM product launch initially based on DDR3 is going well as we've received production orders from Tier 1 customers. We've also signed a lead major OEM customer for the launch of our DDR4 based NVDIMM targeting shipments in calendar Q2.","Micron's hybrid memory cube continues to gain significant traction at leading network and server customers. In addition, similar technology for Micron will be used in Intel's Knights Landing platform for a high performance in low latency benefits in high-performance computing. Finally, our DDR5 product continues to gain wide adoption in gaming consoles and is also being sampled in high-performance networking applications.","Our Storage Business Unit or SBU, recorded $907 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make progress in both the client and enterprise SSD market. We set records for total SSD revenue gigabyte shipped and overall units in our fourth quarter, while also achieving record revenue for both client and enterprise SSD's individually. We increased client SSD shipments to Tier 1 OEMs by 23% quarter-on-quarter.","For our fiscal 2014, SBU revenue was up 23% when compared to 2013, coming in at $3.5 billion. Gross margin dollars were up 17% year-on-year reflecting the overall health of the NAND market. We remain focused on improving the fundamentals of our NAND business as we believe there is upside to our performance relative to our competition in the coming quarters.","I would like to discuss some of the elements which we feel can bolster our NAND business. First, we continue to invest in process innovation. We executed the fastest ramp in our company's history for our 256 gigabit, 16-nanometer planar product. TechInsights recognized Micron with a semiconductor product of the year award and most innovative memory device award for this technology. We're making progress in our 16-nanometer TLC product with engineering samples still on track for the end of this calendar year. We are targeting late spring shipments of TLC components to consumer applications and expect to be shipping a TLC client SSD drive into the market during our fiscal fourth quarter.","Micron will continue to increase our leadership in overall NAND scaling with our 256-gigabit, 3D NAND device, which we believe will have the highest density per square inch of silicon in the industry. We remain on track for calendar Q4 samples and currently forecasting volume production by the second half of calendar 2015. Beyond innovation at the technology level, we continued to add controller and firmware resources that are helping to accelerate product development, enhance the quality of our PCIe SaaS and SATA-based SSD products led by the launch of our M500 DC enterprise product, which targets data center applications, our enterprise SSD revenue was up 79% quarter-on-quarter. This investment in system-level solutions has led new customer wins in server, network security, cloud and video streaming segments in Q4.","In addition to chip and system-level investments, we continue to recruit strong level sales and marketing personnel to position our go-to-market engine for future success. We are investing and expanding our customer engagement support, it is increasingly becoming more of a design and custom solution type relationship with key accounts.","Finally, we are continuing to diversify our NAND business and do more attractive end market applications. As an example, revenue for NAND sold in the mobile segment was up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Coupling NAND with DRAM in the form of eMCPs is a high-growth opportunity. eMCPs are essentially low power DRAM packaged with a managed NAND product all behind the controller. We believe this is solution, is a great example of the value of Micron's portfolio.","We continue to grow share in our consumer products segments with Lexar-branded memory cards and USB products, gaining share in the U.S. and international markets. We remain bullish on the long-term market opportunity in NAND both in terms of the market outlook, and our ability to improve our operating performance. Upside potential in our NAND business will be driven by the chip level innovation including TLC and 3D NAND, investment in system-level capabilities, additional organization capabilities and focused execution on growth and diversifying markets.","We are very pleased with the performance of our mobile business unit. MBU revenue came in at $909 million with a 22% operating margin. We continue to see strong demand in mobile. The iPhone 6 launch appears to be going quite well and reflective of consumer appetite for improving smartphone application features and performance. On the high-end, the Samsung Note 4 is now shipping with 3 gigabytes of low-power DRAM's is the Xiaomi MI4 product line as well.","In NAND, the higher-end configurations have shifted from 32 gigabytes and 64 gigabytes now to 64 gigabytes and 128 gigabytes. We are currently forecasting NAND growth in the mobile segment of greater than 3X year-over-year for fiscal year 2015. The low to mid range price smartphone market is driven additional memory content as well, meeting the entry-level segment is evolving from phones with virtually no DRAM to new products such as the Android 1, which is 1 gigabyte of low-power DRAM. This is $100 smartphone targeting 5 billion users in emerging markets. We are focused on our diversified set of mobile customers and continue to balance our PC DRAM and mobile DRAM capacity to optimize for long-term profitability.","On the product front, we are growing our managed NAND business with increased shipments of eMCPs as I mentioned earlier. The rapid adoption of eMCPs for the low to mid end smartphones, which is the fastest-growing segment today represents a unique opportunity for Micron. Our known good die flow from our MMJ fab formerly Elpida, coupled with Micron's industry-leading 16-nanometer NAND technology enables us to capture share due to the accelerating market shift from eMCP from eMMC.","Over the next year, we are forecasting that roughly 25% of our overall mobile revenue will come from memory combined with the controller. We believe that companies like Micron, who have the portfolio of NAND and DRAM will have a distinct advantage in the long run in the mobile segment.","In addition to managed NAND, we're currently working with our chip partners to enable low-power DDR4 for future qualification in high-performance applications for mobile. I want to congratulate the mobile team for their successful turnaround of the business that within last two years was losing money on the bottom line. We feel that the combination of increasing memory content and mobile devices and the declining rate of mobile industry supply growth due to the attractiveness of other relatively higher margin segments, lead to a healthy overall supply and demand outlook for mobile. We look forward to the teams continued strong execution.","Our Embedded Business Unit or EBU set a record of $1.74 billion in fiscal year 2014 which represent 39% year-over-year growth. Our fourth quarter revenue of $476 million reflected a seventh straight quarter of record shipments for embedded.","Automotive revenues were 40% increase year-on-year. The automotive segment continues to benefit from memory content growth fueled by both infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems. Our commitment to the unique needs of this market in areas such as quality, reliability, longevity and service has enabled us to strengthen our market leadership in Q4.","The broad category of industrial and multi-market, otherwise referred to as IMM, achieved record revenue for both the quarter and the year. Year-on-year revenue growth was 10% to 20% driven by continued growth in factory automation, machine-to-machine systems and aerospace and defense. As we see strong demand growth in areas such as automotive entertainment consumer electronics, connected home devices and machine-to-machine systems, we remain bullish on our EBU performance for fiscal 2015.","Operationally, we had a tremendous year. In a year where we shift to more diversified set of products with more complex packaging and custom configurations to a broader set of end customers, we were able to reduce overall inventory and drive our churns 18% higher compared to the end of fiscal year 2013. This is all the more impressive given the significantly larger revenue scale of our business than which we left 2013.","Our DRAM and NAND front-end cycle times improved 25% and 18%, respectively, year-over-year. And our backend test and assembly facilities reduced their cycle times 33% and 34% for NAND and DRAM. We see additional room for improvement in our operations during fiscal year 2015. The pricing environment for our portfolio of products remains favorable. DC pricing has remained strong with more than 90% of our computing capacity tied to OEM contract pricing most of which with quarterly pricing agreements in place. This has been a positive effect on mobile pricing, as well, having balanced our production to take advantage of PC DRAM ASPs in margins which are currently above the mobile business.","On the NAND front, pricing dynamics are relatively stable heading into the holiday build season. We remain bullish on the long-term outlook for NAND with increasing attach rates in both client and enterprise drives with a strong content move from 128 gigabytes systems trending upwards to 512 gigabytes systems, as well, seeing a big increase in phones.","As the industry converged to 3D NAND, we think performance and cost will continue to improve driving accelerated adoption of NAND and client mobile and enterprise market segments. We see a bright future in NAND another emerging non-volatile memory technologies.","In closing, I also want to congratulate our team for a great quarter and an outstanding fiscal year 2014. We look forward to a strong Q1 and we feel there is opportunity for improved performance in fiscal year 2015 as we continue to drive our memory solutions to higher value-added customers and segments.","With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks Mark. We will now take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone please do pick up the handset when asking a question, so we can hear you clearly and please open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of CJ Muse with ISI Group. Your line is open.","CJ Muse - ISI Group","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question is around DRAM pricing. You talked about greater share in terms of contract and increased duration. We'd love to get an update on what percentage is out two, three months and what kind of visibility you have into the new calendar year from where we are today?","Mark Adams","Well, I'm going to be careful about speculating too far out into the calendar year. My commentary earlier tried to address that we have our top three PC OEM customers on a three-month price increment that ends at the end of September, and the current indication is that we are going to have another discussion around and probably end on a three-month price increment for the calendar Q4 period, and as current market suggests we think those conversations will be in line with stable or slightly improved pricing.","CJ Muse - ISI Group","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the cost side, can you provide an update on where you are on the DRAM 25-nanometer ramp, in terms of percentage output as you move into the November quarter and how we should think about that ramp beyond and the cost savings achieved?","Mark Adams","Okay. Yes. So, just for review purposes, we currently have 25-nanometer product coming out of Hiroshima, which is targeted primarily at mobile. And then we also have our Rexchip facility in production with mobile, 25-nanometer, as well aimed at mobile. Today, as we sit going into the quarter, 25% -- sorry, 25-nanometer product of DDR3 will be roughly about 25% in the quarter out of Hiroshima and in the mobile -- sorry, 50% in Hiroshima and out of Rexchip it will be roughly 25%.","CJ Muse - ISI Group","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush. Your line is open.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush","Good afternoon and congratulations on another great quarter and guidance. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the DRAM business and what percentage is PC DRAM, server DRAM, and mobile DRAM, and then maybe within that we could talk about what's 25-nanometer and how that is shaping up?","Mark Adams","Sure. When you look at our DRAM business, today, the best way to think about it is mobile is roughly about 25% of overall DRAM. And, compute is roughly around 30% of DRAM. And then if you look at the specialty business, you asked about servers. Server is roughly just below 20%. Those are kind of the three areas you asked about.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush","Okay. Great. And thanks so much. That's very helpful. And as we look at the percentage of your DRAM mix today, how does that compare to last year at this time? And as you guys are looking for, you've been talking a lot about optimizing your mix, are we going to see a shift more to PC DRAM, which seems to be the better cost, lower-cost for you and better pricing advantage?","Mark Adams","Well, I don't think we are going \u2013 Betsy, I can tell you where we were last year. So, I said that compute was in the kind of mid to high 30%. It was slightly higher last year but still under 40%. Mobile was lower last year coming out of fiscal year 2013, but increasing as we left the year, and the server business it was slightly higher.","By the way, the question on PC capacity and how we are optimizing, it is not just the mobile to PC dynamic, it's also some of the low-end of the server business that we shifted the capacity back to meet the demand of the PC business.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush","Thanks Mark. That's really helpful. And then my last question and I will jump out. It\u2019s on DDR4, you talked about a very nice pricing premium. And I was wondering if you could give us kind of a range of what type of percentage pricing premium we are going to see? And then, as we are looking at DDR3 and the conversion to DDR4, how are you guys thinking that's going to play out over the next couple of years?","Mark Adams","It\u2019s okay. We are not going to comment on the actual pricing premium. But suffice to say, our production decisions will be driven around our way and margin, not any market share build, necessarily.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush","Okay. Great. Thanks again and congratulations on a great quarter and guidance.","Mark Adams","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities","Thanks and a great quarter. I just wanted to get your perspective on DRAM content in mobile. We are seeing the iPhone 6 use \u2013 one gigabyte of DRAM. Some people were expecting DRAM content to be higher. Just your perspective on that, is that just sort of specific to the Apple ecosystem because we are seeing in android DRAM content go up? Or, is it because DRAM pricing has gone up so much that key OEMs are now trying to minimize the amount of memory in the phone?","Mark Adams","I think it's a little bit of both, to tell you the truth. If you look at the overall category for the mobile segment, DRAM content per unit is up pretty dramatically. Yes, the Apple ecosystem is more efficient, but I also would suggest that given how tight the memory business is, there probably wasn't a lot of room for them to be able to address higher-end configurations.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just back to your outlook for 20% to 25% on bit growth, what is your assumption for mobile within that?","Mark Adams","As we mentioned on prior calls, we think that mobile will be about mid-40s next year in terms of percent bit growth. But, you also have to remember that we stated and will say again today, we are going to manage this from a balanced portfolio perspective and really look at the return piece of the business. In mobile as we said, we don't necessarily need to be the biggest supplier of memory. We want to be the most profitable supplier of memory in helping our customers innovate. And so it's going to be roughly in that area, but we will see over time how it plays out.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities","And then just last question. Is there any revenue impact from the extra weeks?","Ron Foster","This is Ron. There should be and we contemplated that in our revenue guidance of $4.45 billion to $4.7 billion. Theoretically, you get about one seventh additional cost on OpEx and one seventh additional revenue and the COGS moves with the revenue. All I just add, is that at -- one 14th, excuse me 7%. All I'd add is that when it's on the revenue side, you don't necessarily get linear effect from adding one week to the quarter, where you have some customers who are polling from stock, et cetera, on a monthly basis, for example. But, in general, you can think of it that way, about a 7% lift.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping you could help us think a little bit about the free cash flow dynamics in our business. You talked about some of the CapEx increases that you are contemplating into your fiscal year 2015. Maybe you could up us think about your ability to also grow your operating cash flows and if you could talk to where the free cash flow margins are between your DRAM and NAND businesses?","Ron Foster","Sure. Mark, we don't specifically go through detail in terms of what our view in projecting the operating cash flow and free cash flow. We are giving you a view out one quarter. But, if you look at our current trajectories and the stability we are seeing right now on the marketplace, you can extrapolate that going forward and potentially see trend lines in the similar range. But, we don't give guidance beyond one quarter out.","We have also given you the CapEx guidance and so, you have a view of that. It's up some from last year, $3.6 billion to $4 billion. But given current trajectories, we certainly have that \u2013 would have that well covered with operating cash flow. If you look at the DRAM versus NAND breakdown, we don't break out operating cash flow and free cash flow by technology. So, I don't have a view for you on that.","Mark Durcan","Mark, let me add just from a business perspective, clearly, we got a lot of margin opportunities to run our business. Mark talked about some of the pricing trends, I talked about kind of where we see supply going. Internally, relative to the execution, we talk about what we can do on the NAND side relative to adjusting our mix on TLC and eMMC, the mobile space, SSDs, et cetera. So we think we've got a lot of leverage in our business here and we are just very focused on executing what's a pretty good market environment.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","I appreciate the perspective. For a follow-up, are you going to talk on the NAND business, specifically I know at the Analyst Day, you guys \u2013 in information conference you guys have talked about some improvements that you are expecting in NAND over the next two to six quarters. And I understand TLC for example is part of that.","Can you just talk a little bit more depth about how you are progressing with that and maybe you could tie in to some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks on SSDs and how SSDs are impacting both pricing and cost and then the overall profitability levels of your NAND business as we think out over the next few quarters?","Mark Durcan","Let me turn it over to Mark Adams here in a second. Let me just -- on NAND, we will have 16-nanometer samples out in calendar Q4 for TLC. We will have TLC SSD in the marketplace in the summer, maybe slightly before that. And we continue to have pretty good growth in our penetration of planar SSD market as well as the mobile segment generally. Mark, do you want add any color beyond that?","Mark Adams","Well, I think it's important to know that in the cost curves in our NAND business, as SSDs continue to grow as a percentage of our overall NAND business. That will add cost of goods impact because we can get things like controllers and PCBs and rest of the building materials of SSD that go into our COGS calculation. Secondly, I'd like to emphasize that as you can see by the growth quarter-over-quarter, the last two quarters, market access is not a problem. Micron people are leaning on Micron to drive their planar SSD and enterprise opportunities. And we continue to invest in \u2013 these businesses are high-value businesses, they're not ones that you necessarily can develop overnight. We're very happy about the progress in the quarter, especially, as I mentioned, enterprise sales up 79% quarter-over-quarter, well ahead of market growth.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Because the first question I want to talk to a little bit about is the relationship with Inotera. Is that clearly providing a lot of CapEx and this moved to 20-nanometer, but you are providing a lot of the IP to help them get there.","And I'm just kind of curious, as I think about the pricing arrangement of market minus, they're going to get pretty good cost savings with the move to 20 over the next year or so and probably grow bits at a much faster rate than the overall Micron DRAM business. How do I think about kind of your benefit on the gross margin line as they bring down their cost curve?","Mark Durcan","Obviously, it's a complicated relationship. By way of background, you're right. We provide a lot of advanced process technology products, customer access, customer service, a lot of things to the relationship. What we get back is the full output of Inotera the market minus transfer price. But we also get back equity gains on the bottom line.","Without going into too much detail, John, the supply agreement it's a three-year agreement. It calls for annual renegotiation. And any changes to the agreement will be negotiated with the company between Micron and Inotera. And it's other major shareholders. We greatly value the strategic relationship with Inotera and Formosa and we intend to work closely with them to make sure that it's a long-term, sustainable relationship where each party gets a reasonable return, given what they are bringing to the relationship. And not much to add to that.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Got it. And then guys as my follow-up maybe for Ron. Ron, can you remind me again on the currency front, the yen dollar relationship? I think you've historically said every one point move is about a $5 million to $7 million hit to operating margins or benefit to operating profit, sorry. Is that still the correct way to think about it?","Ron Foster","Yes, John. In terms of the yen, which is moving a lot just very recently as we all know, and the comment was on operating spending or general spending -- yen-based spending. Today, our calculus is that our operating spend is impacted about \u2013 which is not just OpEx, but all of our yen-based cost of sales activities, too. Our impact is about $3 million to $4 million per one yen per quarter. Most of the yen-based spending is in COGS, actually, so the impact is delayed about a quarter based on their inventory flow through. So, you need to keep that in mind.","We have a lower level of yen denominated costs today, especially now that we have converted MMJ to U.S. functional currency. And we also have a yen neutral balance sheet. So the metric used now is $3 million to $4 million per one yen change per quarter in our overall cost structure and we contemplated current levels of the yen in our guidance.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","And then Ron, if I could sneak a quick one in, the 30% of CapEx that's non-capacity related, how do we think about the depreciation schedule on that CapEx? Is it similar to the capacity related to CapEx, or is it different?","Ron Foster","The CapEx does not \u2013 you mean the infrastructure in our front-end backend? Yes, it's the same structure.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Congratulations on the good results.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","Yes. Thanks. And just echoing the congrats on good results and guidance. With respect to your outlook for DRAM supply growth next year, fairly favorable. Could you, perhaps maybe elaborate on what you are seeing with your competitors, or if you have a view on what your competitors are doing with their respective capacity? And kind of what your thoughts on their overall projection of supply and how they're managing DRAM supply, as well?","Mark Durcan","We don't have any better insight into what the competitors are doing than you do. We read what they say in their earnings announcements and then in the press, et cetera, et cetera. But what we understand, is that Samsung's had a relatively effective 20-nanometer ramp and pull forward some of the gains that otherwise we are going to have a little bit later in terms of bit production. And we have a sense as to what they're doing to replace wafers loss to the 20-nanometer conversion based on what we've read in analyst and market reports. And so we continue to believe that the supply growth is in that range, given those reported incremental wafers coming from all the various parties in the marketplace.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","And in terms of your overall gross margins, the DRAM margins continue to kind of drift higher and the pricing commentary in DRAM is very positive. When do think we are going to start to hit an inflection point on the NAND gross margin? I know you talked about TLC kind of moving forward. What percentage you think of the output exiting next year will be on TLC, given the fact that there's a big cost delta between MLC and TLC? More specifically, on the NAND gross margins, what's your long-term view?","Mark Durcan","We are still very early in the ramp and deployment. I just mentioned, we'll have a component in the marketplace next calendar quarter, calendar Q4. So kind of depends on how successful we are with market adoption and what goes on in relative pricing in all the various markets we serve. We're still going to be looking at margins and long-term sustainability of that margin. But at least we'll be in a position to address those markets as we move through the year and we think we'll see some continued deployment.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Hi, guys congratulations on a solid guide. Looks like your earnings are approaching $1 a quarter year pretty soon. I had two questions. On the DRAM side, how do you see the 20-nanometer mix ramp through 2015? And I will have the next question after you answer that. Thanks.","Mark Adams","So our DRAM ramp in 2015 won't be significant volume until the second half calendar year. So you should see some volume show up in Q4 of our fiscal year.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Got it. Okay. And on the NAND side, obviously, you are going to TLC and 16-nanometer. Can you look at the mix between client and enterprise on the SSD side, especially? How do you see that mix playing out? What's the mix today and how do you see that playing out next year, exiting next year? ","Mark Adams","Today, our mix is roughly two thirds to 75% client and another one thirds, 25% of the third enterprise. And we think, proportionally, that's in the ballpark a lot of it depends on market conditions and it would be tougher to forecast out that far and how much that would change from where it is today.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Thanks and nice quarter. I was wondering if you could give us an add idea of about how much of your DRAM capacity is moving through the spot market right now and considering these contracts for the next quarter in the PC market, how you feel about leaving some flex capacity for price changes? Thanks.","Mark Adams","Well, I mentioned in my script earlier, less than 10% of our capacity goes to the spot market in DRAM. And so the other way to think about is, greater than 90% go to OEM customers. That being said, as it relates to kind of how we see pricing in our willingness to hold tight, we feel pretty confident where pricing is going in the quarter. We see stabled out pricing and holding inventory and a lot of stuff, we have gotten it before. We are in this business to make money, it's a return decision. We are not looking to liquidate anything. We are in good shape and that's where we're going to act.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Okay. I'm wondering, you made some comments on the strength you are seeing in the server market. And I'm wondering your thoughts on how and during that is, how much might be just the near-term benefit from upgrade the Romley upgrade cycle, are there legs to this going forward that you can see? Thanks.","Mark Adams","Yes. I think we think it's not \u2013 the argument that you just posed is that there's more server units being sold and our proposition is that there is more density, more memory bits going into every server. So if in fact, you are right, you will see even faster memory growth in the server segment. But, we're talking about people wanting to put more capacity in a relatively modest single digit growth server business today.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","All right. One more, if I could. I'm wondering when we get into the back part of next year and you've got your 16-nanometer TLC, where do you expect the competition to be and how do you expect your products to stack up versus that?","Mark Adams","It's hard for us to speculate because we are not inside those companies and their product discussions. But remember something, we have made significant investments and we are very excited about our 3D offering we talked about seeing some 3D production out towards the end of our fiscal year, calendar Q3 next year.","And so, we think there's a good combination in our product portfolio in the second half of the calendar year, next year for consumer and mobile applications requiring 50-nanometer TLC as well as entry-level client devices. And we also are pretty bullish about our 3D development and efforts and we think we will have differentiated solution there on the high-end for -- high performance NAND solutions.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Okay, great. Congratulations again.","Mark Adams","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So actually, I had a question on little bit relating to mix and how that impacts gross margin. So it looks like enterprise NAND seems to be the biggest area, enterprise SSD seems to be the biggest area of growth right now. You said 79% quarter-on-quarter growth. Could you talk about how the \u2013 how much the gross margin is for enterprise SSD versus the rest of the business? And so, and how that might be impacting the gross margin going forward?","And then, I have a follow-up question on your overall SSD business, both client side and enterprise side what percentage of that uses your own control versus some kind of external controller solution?","Mark Adams","So let me talk to the first question around enterprise and the effect on the overall business. Without giving too much away for competitive reasons, just to suffice to say that the enterprise SSD business is an above averaged gross margin business for Micron and we're continuing to develop products and try to maximize their opportunity there. So as we grow that business, it should have a positive impact, all things being equal.","As relates to your second question about internal controllers, we continue to invest internally and resources for both the clients and enterprise market. Today, we have a hybrid development approach, which is primarily around in-house development for value-added controller systems and for the more commodity type products, we look and work with third parties.","Now remember, that doesn't mean we don't add value, because we got firmware development test and all that that goes on in the background with these partners. If you are looking for a rough proxy, I'll ask, I will have Kipp to follow-up. But, my suspicion is, we are somewhere in the 70%, 75% of internal, external controllers, maybe closer to 80% and about 20% internal controller development. And we will follow-up, Mark with the exact numbers.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","That's great. Thanks for that Mark. And then on DRAM, any \u2013 considering the strong pricing guidance you gave for this current quarter we are going into right now, where is pricing strongest and how do think mix might be changing? I'm just wondering because PC DRAM pricing seems to be pretty strong and it seems to have higher margin than average, I understand, for DRAM. I wonder if that percentage of mix might change going forward and so how to think about that?","Mark Adams","But there is two components to that. There is the supply element, right, Mark? And then, the overall end market behavior in terms of demand. As it sits today, and we talked about this in prior calls, we have a certain amount of flex capacity to move between PC and mobile. And we probably haven't emphasized enough, we also have discretion to move some of that PC capacity and server capacity back and forth. Given the strength of the PC market, we've optimized around the PC market on a relative basis, remember we want to be in all three businesses for the long-term.","As it relates to going forward, it's a tougher call in terms of trying to predict that. But PC strength clearly today is helping lift mobile pricing and server pricing and which led to pretty favorable results in the quarter.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","And so then just to follow-up, so why you do think pricing is strongest now. Do you think \u2013 we haven't really seen a huge increase in mobile DRAM prices, yet, like we have for PC DRAM prices. And I just wonder if you might see some further strength in mobile DRAM prices going forward.","Mark Adams","Well, I think that given how we've looked at our \u2013 what I say variable capacity \u2013 I think that's a distinct possibility, assuming demand plays out the way we think it will. We think \u2013 I think that mobile price is likely to trend stable to upwards in the quarter, given some of the new launches and some of the configuration density improvements.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","All right. Thanks very much and great quarter.","Mark Adams","Thanks Mark.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks Mark. Appreciate it.

The DRAM business has significant revenue on margin expansion in the personal systems segment, which achieved the highest revenue in almost three years.","In NAND, we had another quarter of strong unit growth in the SSD segment and took advantage of improved market ASPs generally. We remain focused on making capital and segmentation decisions to optimize margin and free cash flow over time. As you have noticed in the release, revenue in the quarter was up about 12% with strong growth in both DRAM and NAND. Gross margins were also up significantly from 18% to 24% highlighted by DRAM, which was up over 16 percentage points for the quarter. Trade NAND margins improved by about five percentage points and still represent our highest margin product category followed by DRAMs and NOR.","Operating cash flow of $624 million exceeded our disciplined and measured capital expenditures of $235 million. I previously mentioned that we were taking steps to enable some capacity fungibility between different memory technologies. We\u2019re moving forward with plan to convert a significant majority of our DRAM capacity in Singapore to NAND.","We believe the customer demand and margin opportunity in NAND over the next 12 months coupled with a highly attenuated capital investment relative to Greenfield capacity make this a sound financial decision. A measured transition will likely occur over the course of the next year or so depending on market conditions as we continue to monitor the demand and margin profile of our various products and segments. The impact of this conversion will be included in the guidance we provide.","During the quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of our 200 millimeter image sensor fab in Avezzano, and took another step to streamline our operations through restructuring our R&D relationship with STMicro in Agrate, Italy and also discontinued operations of our LED pilot line in Boise. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve our operational structure and performance including the wind down of some remaining 200 millimeter capacity as we migrate more products to 300 millimeter.","We made good progress towards closing the acquisition of Elpida and believe the principal hurdles to closing are mostly resolved. We\u2019ve obtained regulatory clearances, bondholder challenges of a planned reorganization in Japan have been denied, and the waiting period for challenges for the recognition motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court has expired. As a result, we are optimistic the closing will occur during our fiscal Q4.","Elpida financial performance has been strong in recent periods and continues to improve reflecting a strengthening DRAM market, as well as Elpida strong mobile DRAM presence and operational improvements.","During last quarter, Micron and Elpida entered into a joint development agreement that has enabled more seamless integration of our technology roadmaps, and we are encouraged by the early productivity of the cooperation.","Following the close, our overall trade memory wafer capacity will increase by about 45% from today\u2019s level without impacting industry supply. This deal will provide significant revenue and margin leverage for Micron as we are positioned to benefit from low-cost scale, enhanced product and customer breadth, and improved operational efficiency.","We believe conditions remain positive to continue the improvement in the memory industry. We\u2019re forecasting DRAM industry supply up in the mid 20% range this year and lows to mid 20s in calendar 2014. For NAND, we are forecasting supply up in the mid 30% range this year followed by the low 40s in 2014.","We believe this historically slow supply growth coupled with memory demand growth in mobile and infrastructure related markets such as smartphones, storage, and servers, creates a favorable balance. We\u2019re well positioned to capitalize and look forward to driving possible growth in coming quarters.","I\u2019ll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.","Ronald C. Foster","Thanks, Mark. Our third quarter of fiscal 2013 ended on May 30. Our website has a schedule containing certain key results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for the fourth quarter. That information is also presented on the following slides.","For the third quarter, we reported net income of $43 million or $0.04 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. These results compared to the previous quarter\u2019s net loss of $286 million or $0.28 per diluted share on net sales of $2.1 billion. The consolidated revenue growth and improved operating results reflect the significant improvement in the memory markets, particularly for DRAM products. The effect of this improvement can also be seen on the equity and net income of equity method investments line shown on the slide, which largely reflects our share of the net loss from Inotera with a two-month lag. In their two most recent monthly reports, Inotera has reported positive net income, which will be reflected in the next quarter\u2019s results for Micron.","Related to Mark\u2019s earlier comments on our continuing efforts to optimize our operational footprint, these actions have resulted in restructuring charges. This quarter we separately presented those charges as a restructure and asset impairment expense on the face of the income statement. Expenses and asset impairment charges associated with restructure activities from prior quarters have been reclassified to present the operating results on a consistent basis.","In addition, to simplify the presentation of noteworthy items and those items that are not representative of the company\u2019s trended economic performance, we are presenting a schedule of net income for the period as reported, reconciled to net income excluding these certain items. Note that the amounts in the reconciliation do not include all the related income tax effect as the amounts are generally de minimis due to our net operating loss carry forwards and our global tax structure.","The restructure activities over the past two quarters include the following: Approximately [$60] [ph] million charge that we accrued in the second quarter associated with the estimated loss on the sale of our 200 millimeter imaging fabrication facility in Avezzano, Italy to LFoundry. This transaction closed in the third quarter.","For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, the Imaging business reported approximately $60 million of operating loss in our Micron results on sales of approximately $220 million in addition to the restructure charge.","Going forward there will be no future revenue or losses from sales of imaging products. Approximately $26 million in the third quarter for the loss on the transfer of certain assets and approximately 500 employees in Agrate, Italy to STMicroelectronics is also included in the schedule. And approximately $25 million in the third quarter to write down certain production assets used in the LED technology development, which was terminated in the third quarter.","Other recurring items presented in the reconciliation include the amortization of debt discount and other costs. This adjustment which flows into interest expense on our financial statement is substantially comprised of the imputed interest to value the debt component of our convertible notes at fair value. This item will be on-going as long as we have these convertible notes and discounted debt such as the Elpida installment payments.","Foreign currency activity including the impact from our hedging programs is also included. The largest impact in this area is from the hedge of the Elpida Rexchip acquisition, which has been heavily impacted by volatility in the yen exchange rate. Other items called out in the second quarter include a non-cash loss of $31 million from the early redemption of a portion of our outstanding 2014 convertible notes, and two favorable items in the tax provision resulting from the resolution of an uncertainty and a tax rate change both occurring outside the U.S.","So, adjusting for these items, non-GAAP EPS improved from $0.06 loss in our GAAP results in the second quarter to an income of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. As we have mentioned previously, we may undertake additional restructure activities as we continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations.","Let\u2019s turn now to operating results and outlook. Note that none of the guidance we are providing today includes any direct effects from the Elpida\/Rexchip acquisition.","DRAM revenue in the third quarter increased 23% compared to the previous quarter, as a result of a 16% increase in bit average selling prices and a 6% increase in bit sales. The increased selling prices for DRAM products was favorably affected by more Inotera volume sold into higher value segments along with general improvements in the market.","DRAM bit costs decreased 5% quarter-to-quarter driven primarily by the higher concentration of lower cost products from Inotera. The cost of DRAM products purchased from Inotera increased in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, but was still slightly lower than the cost of the rest of the Company\u2019s DRAM production on a per bit basis.","So guidance for Q4 DRAM is as follows; using quarter-to-date selling prices and projected product mix for the quarter, ASPs would be up mid-to-high single-digits compared to the Q3 average. Projected bit costs are expected to be flat relative to Q3, projected production volume is up high single-digits. Key themes influencing this guidance for DRAM are, first four-gig DDR3 volume continues to ramp in our system, comprising over one half of the DRAM bit sales in the third quarter and increasing into the fourth quarter.","This transition from two gigabit to four gigabit has \u2013 have the effect of lowering ASPs and costs with some margin improvement. We\u2019re seeing the somewhat higher percentage of our total bit production from Inotera with improving product mix and costs have moved directionally with prices.","As a reminder, the cost of products purchased from Inotera is based on a moving average market minus model with a one-month lag, while we account for the change in our equity investment with a two-month lag.","The higher output in the fourth quarter is a result of higher output from Inotera partially offset by lower output from our Singapore DRAM fab as we transition existing DRAM capacity there to NAND. This transition will continue through the next year or so based also on market conditions.","Turning now to Trade NAND, bit sales in the third quarter increased 8% compared to the prior quarter, primarily as a result of a higher per bit average selling prices. We continue to see growth in SSD sales, and we built some bit inventory to support strong demand over the coming quarters.","Trade NAND bit costs in the third quarter were relatively flat compared to the second quarter due to a higher SSD production, and some costs related to the start of NAND production in the Singapore DRAM fab. So guidance for Q4 Trade NAND is as follows. Using quarter-to-date selling prices, and the projected mix for the quarter, Trade NAND ASPs would be down mid single-digits.","Bit costs are expected to be down high single-digits, while bit production is expected to be up high single-digits. Key trends affecting for Q4 guidance are, we expect a higher density product mix in NAND, lowering both the ASP and cost per gigabyte while increasing volumes.","We\u2019d expect also to sell more NAND and SSDs with greater capacity per drive, which slightly lower to the average ASP and cost per gigabyte. We continue the migration to 20-nanometer process technology, resulting in lower costs and increasing bit output into both component discrete sales and SSDs.","NOR sales were relatively flat comparing the third quarter to the second quarter in line with our prior guidance. NOR revenue, which has been fairly stable over the past few quarters is expected to decrease by about a third in the fourth quarter as the wireless business accelerates its transition to more NAND-based solutions.","With positive net income, certain stock options and convertible note start to become dilutive in our financials. These diluted items added approximately 23 million shares to the denominator in the EPS calculation for the quarter.","Going forward because of the dilutive effect of the convertible notes and employee stock options has determined using the treasury stock method, the amount of dilution will vary primarily based on the average traded share price for the period.","For example, the average traded share price for the third quarter was approximately $9.85, which resulted in 23 million shares being added to the denominator of our diluted shares. Has the share price been $14 average for this last quarter, approximately 105 million shares would have been added to the denominator.","SG&A expense in third quarter was just below our guided range. We expect SG&A expense in the fourth quarter to be between $135 million to $145 million. R&D expense was $226 million in the third quarter and is expected to be between $230 million and $240 million in the fourth quarter. There was no DRAM development costs sharing with Nanya in the third quarter as the joint development program with Nanya was discontinued earlier in the year. The level of R&D expense in any given quarter can vary based on the timing of product qualifications in the volume of development wafers processed.","The company generated $624 million in cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter as Mark mentioned reflecting improvement in the operating results compared to the prior quarter, the third quarter ended with cash and investments, including non-current investments of just over $2.9 billion.","As Mark summarized, expenses for property, plant and equipment in the third quarter was $235 million and we expect expenditures for the fourth quarter to be between $300 million and $500 million, which will result in fiscal 2013 total spending below the low end of our guided range for the year. We are deferring some capital spending in the second half of our fiscal year as we anticipate changes from the Elpida transaction. We expect to pick up this spending in 2014 as we integrate the two companies.","As previously indicated, we expect the capital intensity of the combined company to be similar to Micron\u2019s stand-alone historical level on a per wafer basis. Cash flow from investing activities in the third quarter includes the cash payments on currency hedges of approximately $200 million, which includes settlement of the previous hedges associated with the Elpida Rexchip acquisition. Similar to the discussion in our conference call last quarter, at an exchange rate of 95 yen per U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar equivalent price for the Elpida acquisition including the installment payments to creditors would be approximately $400 million lower relative to the price when we signed sponsor agreement last summer.","In addition, at the expiration of the initial hedges earlier in the third quarter, we entered into a series of new hedging transactions to mitigate the effect of currency rate changes on 80 billion yen. This 80 billion yen is the initial payment of 60 billion yen due at closing plus the first 20 billion yen installment payment to the creditors in the reorganization process due in December 2014. The total hedging cost for this structure is capped at approximately $30 million of which approximately $24 million was accrued in the third quarter.","Post closing, we currently plan to implement a natural hedging strategy to offset the foreign exchange exposure on the longer dated installment debt by utilizing yen denominated assets such as cash.","In May of this year, Nanya made an additional investment in Inotera, which reduced our ownership from approximately 40% to approximately 35%, because the price of the share sold in Nanya was above our carrying value per share. Micron will recognize a non-operating, non-cash gain of approximately $49 million as a result of the transaction. With the two-month lag in equity accounting for Inotera, this gain will be recognized in operating results in our fourth quarter.","And with that, I will turn over to Mark Adams for his comments.","Mark W. Adams","Thanks, Ron. I\u2019m going to provide some more detail on our third quarter operating performance, as well as share some comments about the current state of the memory market.","Our NAND Solutions Group recorded revenue of $730 million, up 2% when compared to our second quarter. Total Trade NAND gross margins were up 5 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, reflecting improved ASPs and stronger penetration into enterprise SSDs.","Our branded SSD business was $178 million in Q3 and 11% quarter-over-quarter increase. When you combine sales of our Micron branded SSD drives with flash memory we [shift] to our third-party SSD customers, shipments to the SSD segment represented over 60% of our Trade NAND capacity. We continued to migrate the SSD product family to our 20-nanometer flash memory technology with the announcement of our M500 fairly charged at client and web 2.0 applications.","In addition, we launched the industry\u2019s first MLC based PCIe accelerated drives with the Micron P43 for 20M initially targeted at data base applications. We did cross over our 20-nanometer process technology. 20-nanometer production will continue to expand over the next couple of quarters. We plan to commence the ramp of our 16-nanometer technology early in calendar year 2014 and anticipate a faster ramp that occurred at the 20-nanometer node given solid SSD and other socket enablement. In addition, we are pleased with our progress on 3D NAND development and remain focused on driving support for higher end storage applications.","From a pricing perspective, as we shift our SSD portfolio from SLC to higher density MLC, we will see a lower ASP per gigabyte due to density growth per unit and lower cost associated with the technology. The effect is a slight downward movement on ASPs offset by improved cost with a net positive benefit to our gross margins. Due to this mix effect, our quarter-to-date mix adjusted trade NAND ASPs are forfeited down mid single digits based on quarter-to-date pricing with expected continued improvement in margins. In short, we remain optimistic for a strong second half of the calendar 2013 for Flash memory.","Sales for our DRAM Solutions Group came in at $924 million, up 23% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in sales were driven by 16% increase in overall DRAM pricing coupled with a 6% increase in DRAM shipments when compared to Q2. Our overall, DRAM gross margins came in just above the 24% corporate average, up over 16% from our second quarter. We achieved outstanding results in all of our premium DRAM segments with non-PC business representing about half of our gigabit shipments.","Our server business recorded record shipments with the total sales of over 260 million gigabit equivalents driven by increased SSDs at key OEMs and cloud service providers. We had a record quarter in our networking business for both revenue and bit shipments. DRAM bit shipments in networking were up 19% compared to our second quarter and now represents 16% of our DRAM revenue. We had another strong quarter and made progress to expand beyond the large OEM business to smaller customers and distributors in the sale of our networking portfolio.","Sales of our networking products through distribution are up a 139% year-over-year. We also had a strong quarter in our Consumer Graphics segment, which continues to be an attractive premium market and bit in particular looking forward with the upcoming launch of next-generation gaming consoles. DDR3 volume represented 75% of our overall DRAM production as DDR2 is addressing more of the legacy market requirement.","We are optimistic we will begin shipment of our 25-nanometer DDR3 technology in early fiscal year 2014 and start sampling our 20-nanometer DDR3 product by the end of calendar year 2013. We\u2019re getting positive market feedback from Micron's DDR4 samples at our key OEM customers.","Overall, DRAM continue to be a \u2013 to gain momentum and we had strong design in activity with the neighbors and OEMs for Hybrid Memory Cube. From a market standpoint, U.S. carrier CapEx for LTE deployment is strong and data center networking remains a bright spot for investment by key OEMs.","DRAM pricing continued to be favorable. We are seeing good progress in narrowing the gap between spot market sales and our OEM customers to negotiate contract pricing.","As we mentioned on our last call, the PC segment is a lower percentage of our DRAM business at about 40% of revenue. Our specialty business typically lags in market in terms of price movement in either direction and that\u2019s had a limiting effect on our combined DRAM pricing. As such the current spot market price increase in pricing while still positive has less of an impact on our overall DRAM ASPs.","Channel inventory stayed tight throughout the quarter, which earlier are on allocation on a number of DRAM products and not seeing any signs of a let down in demand at the end of the summer month. The DRAM supply and demand remains favorable balance and we think the situation will remain for the second half of calendar year 2013.","Sales by the Wireless Solutions Group were up roughly 30% quarter-over-quarter as we saw increased demand in both our major OEM customers and the Tier II China mobile market. Supply for mobile DRAM and NAND products remain tight due to strong demand for tablets and smartphones. Our Low Power DDR3 16 gigabit product is in the design phase at the top smartphone manufacturers. Our NAND based MCPs have gained strong traction in the overall market with growing share in the China smartphone market.","Our portfolio of e-MMC and EMCP products is expanding with strong presence across all of our customer base. From a market perspective, we saw improved pricing trend in the Tier II China market and then expanding to our larger OEM customers.","As I have mentioned on prior calls, we are in the turnaround mode in our wireless business, but are making progress, as we reduced our operating losses by about $25 million when compared to Tier II. We are very excited about the future combined mobile offering of the combined Micron Elpida Wireless Group and continue to receive strong support from top mobile customers.","Our Embedded Solutions Group had another record revenue quarter eclipsing the $300 million mark. The embedded business maintain strong gross margins in Q3. We continue to invest and growing our presence within this category.","ESG\u2019s automotive segment increased market share highlighted by our automotive eMMC product portfolio and setting our record shipment to automotive in the quarter. We are seeing a rapid transition from NOR to low density NAND in the embedded market.","In fact, our embedded NAND business roughly doubled quarter-over-quarter from Q2 to Q3. Despite this we keep targeting our NOR margins, and are on track for qualification of our 300 millimeter, 45 nanometer NOR technology in early calendar 2014. Overall, demand for ESG product is increasing, and we are optimistic for a strong Q4.","Our Q4 results reflect the improving memory market, and good execution in key operating areas. We continue to manage our expense lines as reflected by our SG&A and R&D staying in alignment with last quarter spending, and our guidance for Q3. We continue to drive inventory term performance down that\u2019d be flattish by higher cost of goods in the quarter.","We successfully concluded the sale of our Avezzano imaging fab and are continuing explore ways to optimize our manufacturing footprint to allow the future capacity needs. Despite the current marketing conditions improving, we have managed also to reduce our overall headcount by 7% compared to second quarter.","As we look to invest in high-value differentiated memory solutions, we also remain committed to driving maximum efficiency in our operations. Our management team has been working diligently on integration plans with Elpida. The teams have worked well together, and we are excited about the opportunity for the consolidated business going forward. After the close of our Elpida transaction, we will have increased our trade memory capacity over 90% compared to early last year, all with existing industry capacity.","Our customers are supportive and encouraged about the prospects of the scale of Micron with Elpida, and are seeking a new level of strategic alignment for advanced memory solutions. Micron\u2019s customers understand memory is evolving to new applications and form factors moving to a more solutions orientation. We are measured in our approach to capital spending as we transition technology nodes over the next 12 to 18 months. The market for both DRAM and NAND remains in good balance and we are optimistic for a strong Q4.","With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.","Kipp A. Bedard","Thanks, Mark. We will now take questions from callers. (Operator Instructions) With that, please open up the phone lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi.","Glen S. P. Yeung \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Just a question about the opportunities, the demand opportunities from gaming, we\u2019ve seen those game consoles go from quite a low amount of DRAMs to quite a high number now. To what extent do you think this is a meaningful demand driver for DRAM in the next few quarters?","Mark W. Adams","","I think, it\u2019s \u2013 Glen, this is Mark Adams. I think it\u2019s all pretty positive for us. When we look at the gaming sector and compare it to other segments, it\u2019s still a pretty positive segment for us. Looking at densities kind of on average about 8 gigabytes, it\u2019s all pretty favorable and of course, going to the holiday season, we\u2019re pretty excited.","Glen S. P. Yeung \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Can I ask another question about cost then, just thinking about Inotera, I recognize Inotera costs are below yours and over time it\u2019s a bit of drag on the net cost down at the companies. But is there a point at which the cost come together and at that point, do we then kind of revert back to more normal cost declines in DRAM?","D. Mark Durcan","Glen, this is Mark Durcan. You know it\u2019s not likely to happen in the short-term and that\u2019s primary because there is a pretty significant difference in the mix that runs in Inotera today versus the mix that runs in other places. So you look at Micron DRAM today, there\u2019s a lot of networking, server, consumer, gaming, products that aren\u2019t necessarily found in Inotera that typically drive pretty good ASPs, but also maybe, not advancing to the leading edge node as quickly.","So we\u2019re not particularly concerned that the cost profiles don\u2019t marry up. the other thing to keep in mind obviously is that going forward Inotera cost to Micron are going to track with the end markets and those are going to move over time. As we bring Elpida into the fold, we will have a wholly owned DRAM capacity that will be much more leading edge and cost efficient to service some of those more high volume markets.","Glen S. P. Yeung \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you. You said that nano is the most profitable category. but it doesn\u2019t look that far apart if you look at DSG being a little higher than NSG, and I know that doesn\u2019t map exactly to the chips. But they\u2019re pretty close and now you\u2019ve got DRAM prices going up and NAND going down. So going forward, how do you think about the relative profitability of the two and how do you think about moving capacity over to NAND. Is it possible that DRAM will be more profitable?","Mark W. Adams","So I think the clarification I\u2019d like to make is that the pricing trend you identified in NAND, I should clarify is really driven by a shift and a mix from SLC and MLC and some other applications. Now, we think as gross margin positive and we think the relative profitability is about the same.","D. Mark Durcan","And let me jump in here, we\u2019re not going to be moving capacity around on a high frequency basis. the changes we\u2019re making are over the long haul and if we look at the market going forward for NAND, there is just insatiable demand. It looks like there\u2019s pretty strong demand growth out there into the future and that\u2019s why we\u2019re making the adjustments.","Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great, thank you. And then at the beginning of the quarter, you had talked about NAND bits being up sequentially and they ended up flat and pricing being down and ended up quite a bit higher, what was the change over the course of the quarter, (inaudible)?","Mark W. Adams","Sure. Ron had mentioned in his comments that the nature of the SSD business will provide some variance in terms of inventory levels and how we stage products for our strategic customers around SSDs. And when you get to a category that as I mentioned in my comments are up around 60% of our trade NAND capacity that will have a effect on the timing of the shipments.","Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs","James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about the DRAM capacity situation for a second. Many of your competitors have talked about transitioning from PC DRAM to mobile, I was wondering if you still see that continuing in the industry at large for the foreseeable future or if you see that reaching equilibrium at some point soon?","Mark W. Adams","Well, we still are pretty positive on that trend, James, this is Mark Adams again. We still are pretty positive and watching it, but at this point, we don\u2019t see a shift away from that trend.","James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, fair enough. And then just as a follow-up then on the NAND side in terms of capacity, there has been quite a bit of controversy about how much capacity is going to get added this year on the NAND side? Can you maybe give us your feeling about roughly your estimate of how many wafer starts get added to NAND by the end of 2013?","Mark W. Adams","I think, we all kind of read the same thing in the press and hear similar things from various suppliers that are out there talking these numbers, so I can\u2019t tell you that that I have better insight of the math, but I think some of the numbers that have been previously reported, we\u2019re potentially jumping the gun on what Micron might do. So you should factor that into any thinking you have as to what\u2019s happening with NAND supply, and obviously, as I\u2019ve just told you, we\u2019re going to watch what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and meter that in a measured way given supply and demand. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I am not aware of any big new fabs coming in the NAND arena other than the one that Samsung actually has under construction in Xi'an and I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that having a significant impact on the marketplace in 2014.","James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee.","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","Yeah, hi, guys. On your gross margin, it looks like it came up pretty nicely on the quarter. Just looking out given the improving profitability on DRAM and NAND and historically you guys have hit 30% back in the 2010 timeframe, how do you see that going out?","Mark W. Adams","Hey, Vijay, as you know from following us for a long time, we just stay away steadfastly from trying to predict gross margins. We\u2019re going to let you guys do that. Would you like to ask a follow-up question or should we move on?","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","On Inotera, I was wondering, it looks like you guys \u2013 that that\u2019s a big profitability in the last two months, how do you see that contribution going forward?","Ronald C. Foster","","Vijay, this is Ron. If you look at the Inotera structure, as I mentioned in my comments, we are on an ASP minus arrangement structure and it\u2019s a moving average formula. So as Mark already commented, there will be a tendency for the cost to move with the market pricing, what it gives us is a stability of a major segment of our DRAM capacity with pretty good margin structure. But you\u2019re going to see the cost move with the price moves in the market, ASP moves in the market in general.","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman from Sanford Bernstein.","Mark Newman \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. Thanks a lot. So, could you give a brief update on the technology side, you mentioned, 3D NAND progress is pretty good, if you got any further update on that. And I\u2019d like to understand a little bit more about on the NAND side, what you\u2019re doing in terms of \u2013 what do you have in terms of controller and system expertise and you mentioned, there is a quite a few of your \u2013 you\u2019re selling, your SSD sales were up quite a bit, I think you said, 11% increase to $178 million. I\u2019d like to get a sense of your controller expertise and how that\u2019s helping you and how you\u2019re kind of working on that to improve it? Thanks.","D. Mark Durcan","Okay. So this is Mark Durcan, let me jump in on the technology question first and I\u2019ll let Mark address the controller firmware software capability piece of that question. So from a non-volatile advanced memory perspective, we feel like we\u2019re very, very well-positioned relative to those we compete against, not only in the NAND arena, but also in some of the emerging memory spaces. So let me address NAND first.","Mark commented earlier on the call, on the 16-nanometer roll out, there has been a lot of different terminologies out there about 2X, 2Y, 1X, 1Y, I don\u2019t know how that maps to somebody else\u2019s nomenclature. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody else out there with 16-nanometer [half edge] [ph] product, and I\u2019m pretty confident that that\u2019s going to be the smallest cell size planar NAND in the marketplace here over the next couple of quarters. So feel pretty good about how we\u2019re positioned on planar NAND.","Moving to 3D NAND, we\u2019re very happy with the progress we are making on our 3D NAND programs. we believe every one is taking a slightly different approach and obviously, we like our approach the best. but we don\u2019t have complete visibility in what everyone else is doing.","I would say that you\u2019re going to see samples in the marketplace from a number of different competitors over the next few quarters. But you\u2019re not going to see any significant production occurring until the second half of 2014, you really won\u2019t see anything that has any impact on the marketplace probably until the 2015 timeframe. I\u2019m not saying that, because I think I\u2019m behind anybody else, I\u2019m just trying to give you a sense of what the impact on the marketplace might be.","Relative to some of the other emerging technologies that are out there, whether there are storage-class memories or pure NAND replacements et cetera, we\u2019ve got a number of different programs going with a number of different partners, as well as some purely internal ones and we really like the way we positioned our company in terms of being able to work on anything that we think is fruitful and do it in a cost effective a way as possible with the partnerships we\u2019ve created.","So if you\u2019re thinking about who is going to be positioned for any memory technology transitions that are coming down the pipe, we feel very good about how we\u2019ve positioned the company. Mark, do you want to talk about controls?","Mark W. Adams","Sure. I think I\u2019ve mentioned in the past couple of calls, our strategy on controller development around SSDs and around NAND solutions in general has kind of philosophically been, we\u2019re going to partner externally for entry level client type devices, consumer devices, and for some of the higher value add differentiated products, we\u2019re going to invest in our own controller development and that\u2019s pretty much played out at least to-date. For example, I referenced a PCIe Accelerator drive earlier in my comments, and that\u2019s a controller that Micron developed in-house at their own controller scheme as well as firmware organization.","Over the long run, I think you\u2019ll see us add to those efforts and themes as we see more opportunities for differentiated solutions on the high end of the storage market. In addition to that, we see pretty good value, and doing so more on firmware and on eMMC solution for both the embedded and mobile market, but again, the way to think about it is kind of your differentiated higher end value add solutions. We\u2019re going to try to do in-house with our controller and firmware teams, and on the entry level solutions, to be more along the lines of the third-party partnerships, maybe with their control in our firmware or totally outsourced.","Mark Newman \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay, thank you so much. That\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I apologize if I missed it. You guys talked about the industry supply growth expected over the next 12 months, and your ability to outgrow that given the Elpida acquisition?","Mark W. Adams","Sure, John. We\u2019re looking at DRAM in the low-to-mid 20 range for this year, and then low 20 range for 2014. As you pointed out with the Elpida acquisition, we\u2019ll probably be above that. On the NAND side, we\u2019re looking at mid 30s for this year, and probably low 40s for next year. Again, we\u2019ll probably be slightly ahead depending on the pace at which Mark decides to move the Tech fab.","John W. Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And then maybe a question for Mark Durcan, Mark, just given that, when you look at the DRAM side of the equation, for the first time and perhaps over a decade, we seem to have some pretty good demand drivers out there whether it\u2019s the gaming console on the back half of the year with the fact as you move to multicore chips in handsets, you are just seeing DRAM density go up. At what point would it make sense to actually grow that DRAM asset base more quickly just given how strong the demand signals are and what would you need to see to really take a meaningful step up in your capital spending plans?","D. Mark Durcan","Well, as we look at those kind of decisions, it\u2019s a multi-year investment payback decision, right. So we have to be sure, but we don\u2019t see any significant oversupply being created as a result of that activity in a horizon of which we\u2019re going to recoup the capital expenditure. So we\u2019re going to be pretty careful about having additional DRAM capacity as opposed to optimizing the existing capacity we have.","Now, we talked about frangibility between the various types of capacity and the transitions we are making currently moving from DRAM to NAND are reversible. We typically choose to do that as we transition a technology note that\u2019s the most cost effective time to do it. So, we could see some of that actually reversed at some point in the future if necessary. We also do have some premium space available, so we can probably react a little bit more quickly than some of our competitors if we decide and we wanted to move in that direction, but we don\u2019t have any plans at all to do that. We\u2019re going to have a little bit of digestion here with Elpida and optimizing that operation and we\u2019re going to also be pretty focused on realigning our balance sheet where we like it to be for the long haul, and then taking obviously a pretty close look at capital spending before we engage in any.","John W. Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And then, Mark, maybe I\u2019d just sneak one in just on that balance sheet, given that the model is now generating significant free cash flow and you\u2019re starting to see some dilution from the converts, I\u2019m just kind of curious is how we should think about fixing the balance sheet over what timeframe, what kind of looks interesting and is there anything you can do to help keep the share count down?","D. Mark Durcan","Well, yeah, let me (inaudible) and then maybe Ron has got a few additional comments. Obviously, we\u2019ve done a little bit of convert repurchase here over the last few quarters and we\u2019ll have more appetite to do that, obviously, as we deleverage the balance sheet and have available factors to do, but we have to trade that off against the other options of how we return value to the shareholders, but that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be looking at. Ron?","Ronald C. Foster","Sure. On the share count side, John, we\u2019ve got, in terms of our convertible debt instruments, we have actually targeted those to be lightest possible on the equity, lot of them created to be pretty debt light, but yet still leverage the volatility of our stock in the pricing of the instrument. So we are using the treasury stock method on all of our dilution calculations and basically that slows the rate of dilution and that\u2019s why I gave you an example of how it will actually work as you flow that through the divisor on the EPS calculation. And going forward, obviously, we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been careful and continue to be careful about equity position, but the dilution effects will play through the stock prices, but maybe I just give you a quick formula, so you get an idea of how it works and we can certainly give you more information offline if you want.","If you take the average share price of the stock in the period we\u2019re reporting and subtract out the strike price on the instrument and our strike prices tend to be in the eight, nine kind of range on pricing on the stock, so you take that average price minus the strike price divided by the average market price, so you get a percentage, multiply times your share count on that instrument, that gives you the dilution effect. So it\u2019s a muted dilution effect unless you get, really get high up in the stock price, and that\u2019s how that works and why we constructed them that way.","In addition, we also have exercised Capped Calls on virtually every one of our instruments and we\u2019ve got several $100 million for example at a $14 strike price that will come in as the benefit of Capped Calls raising that strike price up. As an economic benefit, but obviously it could accrue to us in cash and we could repurchase shares or whatever. Mathematically, we get the economic benefit and we decide what we want to do with it. So we\u2019ve done Capped Calls as well as that treasury stock method to make it minimized.","John W. Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Helpful, Ron. Thank you.","Ronald C. Foster","Yes.","","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question is, I am trying to understand I am comparing the NAND cost declines in 2012 quarterly over 2013, so in 2012, you had a very nice NAND cost declines, and Q1 2012 was minus 16, then minus 18 in Q2, minus 29 in Q3, but if I compare that with 2013, Q1 cost was up 2%, the second quarter was minus 5% and third quarter is again plus 1%. So we understand that the benefit of shrinks is declining, but just trying to understand what else could be the reason?","Mark W. Adams","Yeah, Monika, a big variable in all this obviously is mix. There is lots of flavors in NAND, there\u2019s SLC NAND, MLC NAND, TLC NAND and that depends on that kind of slung a couple of times as we\u2019d moved through different technology node generations and different applications of the NAND is going into. So if you go back in the timeframe you\u2019re alluding to, there was a fairly significant swing in the MLC and even at Micron from some relatively small amount of TLC, which drives a significant bit cost reduction.","As we move through more recent quarters, we\u2019ve actually seen slowdown in some of the technology transitions driven by more highly reliable and non-changing biz going into high reliability SSDs as well as the 20-nanometer conversion that I alluded to, earlier Mark alluded to, actually driving potentially higher RAM cost initially as that wind in and then go on little bit slower at the 20-nanometer node than it did at the 34-nanometer node. So a lot of different things to play into that. But generally speaking, we feel like we\u2019re doing what we need to do in the NAND business.","John W. Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","And then the last question is on the mobile DRAM size. So we\u2019ve seen PC DRAM pricing significantly up quarter-over-quarter. Could you talk about the trends in the mobile DRAM pricing, especially given the some publically available data shows that in Q2, mobile DRAM pricing was actually down quarter-over-quarter?","D. Mark Durcan","Yeah. I\u2019ll let Mark address the specifics of more recent moves in the marketplace. But what I would say relative to PC and mobile DRAM pricing dynamic is that, obviously, there is a pretty significant price advantage for mobile DRAM earlier in the year, and as more bits have converted from PC DRAM for mobile DRAM to meet that rapidly growing demand, we\u2019ve seen PC DRAM start to catch up.","Eventually, these things are likely if the market position for us to equilibrate at an ASP that\u2019s about different \u2013 about equivalent to the difference in cost sort of gross margins are neutralized between the two. And that\u2019s probably where it\u2019ll oscillate around here over the next couple of quarters as demand and supply, the people consuming the bits and people producing the bits, work out that equilibrium. And also say that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s sort of a process we went through on the NAND, the discussion we just had as we think about SLC, MLC, TLC, 20-nanometer, 34-nanometer, what we are doing is, we\u2019re optimizing gross margin, and whether it\u2019s mobile to PC DRAM or MLC to SLC to 20-nanometer or 34-nanometer or 25-nanometer, we\u2019re just optimizing gross margin based on customer demand.","John W. Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.","Brian C. Peterson \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Hi, this is Brian Peterson in for Hans. Just a quick question on the NAND side, you indicated that gross margins were up 5 points sequentially, but looking at the operating margins, they were actually down. And I know the consolidated OpEx numbers were in line, it\u2019s a little bit lower than you\u2019re expecting. So could you just give some color on the disconnect there?","D. Mark Durcan","Yeah, I think the differences that NAND goes into a number of different business units at Micron. So the numbers you\u2019re referring to are NSG numbers, but obviously there is NAND that goes into ESG that in many cases it carries a pretty significant premium. There is also NAND going into mobile products and MCPs and sometimes it\u2019s tough to even figure out exactly what the gross margin is in those products that can be either higher or lower. So it\u2019s a PU effect versus a NAND technology effect.","Brian C. Peterson \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Just lastly, on the supply side for NAND, I thought that the previous forecast was kind of in the mid 30s, and it looks like you\u2019re talking about low 40s now, so, just to clarify, is that a little bit of an increase and what\u2019s driving out there?","D. Mark Durcan","Actually, I gave you both years, for 2013, we now think it\u2019s a little bit lower than our last calls. We\u2019re now in the mid 30s with the rest of the market and it\u2019s for 2014, we\u2019re looking at low 40s.","Brian C. Peterson \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Okay. Thank you.","D. Mark Durcan","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my question, guys. If you could talk a little bit about, you just mentioned you\u2019re looking at moving DRAM to NAND and what can we expect that to have an impact on your bit output growth and in which quarter should we expect that?","Mark W. Adams","","It\u2019s all included, Doug, in the guides that we give you and we \u2013 if you go back to the last quarter conference call, we did mention we were starting to prep the fab, so we\u2019d have an impact of lowering our DRAM bit growth in Q3, but it\u2019s in our guide as we give it to you.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","So the transition will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter that you\u2019ve just guided?","Mark W. Adams","No, not at all, yeah, over probably the next four quarters or so with adjustments from market.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get at is the transition I imagine it has some sort of a negative impact on your total potential production output. What type of a handicap are you operating under as you migrate DRAM to NAND?","Mark W. Adams","It\u2019s \u2013 that piece is pretty transitional and you\u2019ve seen some of the impact as Ron alluded to earlier on, had an impact on both probably DRAM and NAND costs in the quarter we just finished and that will probably continue for another quarter and then we withdrew the overall manufacturing input back, but the actual transition will occur in the over four quarter period (inaudible).","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Mark W. Adams","So the reason there, Doug, is you got to create some wide space to get the tools in and then once you reach sort of an equilibrium, you\u2019re not suffering anymore downside.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. In the past, we did get some filing when you did some of your debt restructuring with some numbers around Elpida, can you give us some update on their financial performance?","Ronald C. Foster","Doug, this is Ron. Mark already made a comment in his script about the Elpida, the strength of performance in moving in line with the DRAM business, we don\u2019t have information at this time that\u2019s available to update beyond what he already said.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. If I could then just follow-up on the inventory, you made a comment that your NAND inventory dip was up in the SSD segment, but yet your overall inventory at the company was only up $11 million. Does that mean that DRAM was actually down to offset the NAND that you built?","D. Mark Durcan","The comments I made was just around some SSD and the web pipeline. And, obviously, there\u2019s a whole lot of moving parts in the broad mix of our portfolio. So I wouldn\u2019t draw that conclusion between DRAM and NAND; just moving parts in total. We are continuing to manage cycle times in our inventory and trying to improve all of those activities quarter-by-quarter, so some of that effect helps us as well.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I guess, I\u2019ll leave you alone after one last one, if you could, what are you seeing the inventory in the marketplace given the fact that pricing has been rising in both NAND and DRAM? Can you give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace inventories? Thank you.","Mark W. Adams","Yeah, sure, Doug, this is Mark Adams. Overall, inventory looks pretty tight right now on both NAND and DRAM. We \u2013 sometimes when we head into the summer, you see a bit of a little low on the buying behavior of our customers. Quite honestly at this point in our quarter, we have not seen that and the demand signal seem pretty strong. There is rumors about accumulation and all that stuff, but we have not felt that at this point.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Goodman from CLSA.","Ryan C. Goodman \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question. One of the curious reason we discussed are some of the remaining empty clean room space was going to have to end up being used up to enable the one wide transitions in NAND. So I was curious if you\u2019re seeing a similar dynamic to that, and how we should be thinking about slightly in IMFS, how much open clean room space there is and how much of that you will have to use be up to 16 nanometers?","D. Mark Durcan","Yeah. Well, 16 nanometers for us is a very easy capital equipment transition, because there\u2019s a planner node for a planer node and you\u2019ll recall that we made the transition to a different kind of planner, but a planner NAND cell when we move to 20-nanometer.","so if you look at Micron\u2019s 20-nanometer storage element, it\u2019s very different than the other folks. It\u2019s the high-k dielectric and the cell itself is planner, so that technology extends for us, and it\u2019s a relatively easy transition. So I don\u2019t think in terms of big planner requirements for us to move to 16-nanometer. Now, what is true for all of us, I think likely be true for all of us is, moving the 3D is going to consume significant amount of incremental clean room capacity to maintain the same wafer output. But the productivity of that transition is very, very high.","So it makes sense to go ahead and do that. Now, relative to that question for Micron in our fab in Singapore, a wholly owned NAND fab in Singapore, we have a lot of clean room space there and we can get rolled on our transition to 3D NAND without having NAND in the incremental clean room space.","Ryan C. Goodman \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just different areas, high mix in RAM has recently came out with a settlement announcement. So I think it\u2019s down to just you as the remaining participant in litigation with DRAM. Is there any update on there in terms of timing or expectations or anything you can help us with there?","D. Mark Durcan","There is an appeal that\u2019s on file now that I believe is heard again in about a year.","Ryan C. Goodman \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Kipp A.

For our second fiscal quarter of 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $763 million. Our results were impacted by continued weakness in the PC market, seasonality and timing of product launches in certain market segments.","We are continue -- we are simultaneously ramping qualifying and delivering several leading edge products including 20-nanometer DDR4, low-power DDR4, and 3D NAND based solutions. Our progress has been strong, but is always challenging to precisely align technology conversions and fab output with customer qualification cycles and market seasonality.","Today I\u2019d like to provide a high-level overview of our progress in each of the business units and have asked Ernie to cover business unit metrics and financial performance.","In our Compute and Networking business unit, we recently achieved initial customer qualifications from our 20-nanometer 8 gigabyte DDR4 products. These are now ramping in volume.","In the Enterprise, we\u2019ve qualified an innovative NVDIMM solution at two major OEMs. In the Graphic segment, we\u2019re enthusiastic about the early success of our GDDR5X a discrete solution for increasing data rates above 10-gigabits per second. We\u2019ve several major design wins and expect to have the products available by the end of the current fiscal quarter.","In the Networking segment, we are seeing early signs of demand recovery in China, where we believe our broad portfolio and strong customer engagements position us well for the future.","Turning to our Mobile business unit, results have been negatively impacted by the timing of product qualification as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4 products.","We do expect to finalize 20-nanometer low power DDR4 qualifications with most customers by the end of this quarter and this coupled with our expectation that memory demand across the smartphone categories will continue to expand, leaves us confident that our mobile business is well positioned for substantial growth by the fourth fiscal quarter of this year.","In our Embedded business unit, automotive design-in activity remains strong, particularly with 20-nanometer DDR3 and low power DDR4 products. We\u2019re seeing growth with automotive customers in greater Asia and continuing to build upon success with European and U.S manufacturers.","We are also generating strong design-in activity for our industrial SSDs and we\u2019re delivering a broad portfolio of differentiated Non-Volatile Memory, DRAM and MCP solutions to the Consumer and Connected Home segments.","Finally, our Storage business unit has been positioning us product portfolio to take advantage of our high-performance 3D NAND technology. We are currently sampling Tier-1 OEMs with early versions of our 3D NAND enabled PCIe NVMe client SSDs.","Over the next two quarters, we will be shipping crucial branded low-cost 3D NAND client SSDs, high-performance drives targeting gaming enthusiasts, and a 2 terabyte client OEM drive.","In summary, the leading edge technology deployment is progressing well across manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and our bit growth and cost reduction targets are on track. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive significant improvement in Micron\u2019s relative competitive position in the second half of 2016 and beyond.","Turning to the memory industry more generally, we believe that DRAM industry bit supply will decrease to the low to mid 20% range in 2016 and could drop a low 20% in 2017. Our estimate is based on slowing technology driven supply growth and no incremental wafer supply.","Although the current environment remains challenging, we believe -- we continue to believe that longer term DRAM bit demand growth in the low to mid 20% range will result in healthy market fundamentals.","For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid to high 30% range as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. We continue to expect the cost and performance advantages of 3D NAND will drive enhanced adoption rates and densities across key storage markets and we\u2019re confident in Micron\u2019s roadmap in 3D NAND in terms of timing, performance, and relative cost position.","Internally and from our operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key operating priorities. For DRAM, we continue ramping 20-nanometer. This technology node will represent more than 50% of our fab bit output in the current fiscal quarter.","We are enabling 1X DRAM in manufacturing and recently began transferring this technology to our Taiwan fab in Taichung. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer in volume starting in fiscal 2017. We are still forecasting our own fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth CAGR in the 20% to 30% range. This is likely above the market.","On current year bit growth, we will be weighted to the second half of fiscal year 2016 with substantial bit production output gains in fiscal Q3 and Q4. We currently have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity, so any market share growth in DRAM will be the result of technology deployment.","For NAND, we\u2019re ramping Gen 1 3D NAND in Singapore and expect to have more than 50% of our NAND bit fab bit output on 3D by the fall of 2016. We are also enabling Gen 2 3D in manufacturing and expect to be in early production starting this summer.","We are forecasting Micron\u2019s fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth CAGR in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be below the market in 2016, but well above the market in 2017.","Most of this growth will be related to 3D and TLC conversions which will begin to deliver more substantial bit growth and cost reductions starting late in fiscal year 2017 \u2013 2016, excuse me.","We are planning for incremental capacity with our Singapore fab expansion and are beginning two installations this quarter. As always, we continue to be mindful of market conditions as we contemplate our investment decisions.","Relative to 3D cross point, we\u2019re working with market enablers and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron\u2019s future success. We continue to augment our controller and subsystem capabilities, and have made good progress in aligning this roadmap with our 3D NAND RAM. We expect to substantially expand our vertical -- vertically integrated solutions over the next 12 months.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Ernie.","Ernie Maddock","Thank you, Mark. Before sharing our normal financial summary, I\u2019ll cover more technology and business unit details. DRAM represents 54% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile was in the low 20% range, the PC segment was in the mid 20% range, the server business was in the low 20% range, and specialty DRAM which includes networking, graphics, auto, and other embedded technologies was in the high 20% range.","And our Non-Volatile Memory business, trade revenue represented 37% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes our memory cards, USB, and components, represented more than 50%. Mobile, including MCP was in the low teen percent range, while SSDs were in the mid teens percent range. Automotive and industrial multi-market segment and other embedded applications were in the mid teens percent range.","Moving on, I\u2019ll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. First, CNBU. The Compute and Network business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.05 billion, down 8% from the previous quarter impacted by lower average selling prices and continued softness in demand from the PC segment.","Our non-GAAP operating loss was $55 million or 5%. Our high-value solutions from Enterprise, Networking, and Graphics market helps to offset some of this weakness. In the Enterprise and Cloud segment, we continue to see significant demand from our DDR4 solutions; specifically within the cloud segment we had record DDR4 shipments increasing our market share with key hyper-scale customers in Asia Pacific.","Within the Enterprise segment, demand for our 32 gigabyte DDR4 RDIMM also gained significant traction with key customers. In Graphics, we continue to see demand softness; however, second half demand looks stronger for products such as our 20-nanometer 8 gig GDDR5 solution.","In Networking, we also saw slowdown in demand as a result of lower LTE shipments during the quarter, but we\u2019re expecting a recovery in the second half of the year. Finally, within the client segment, we achieved successful enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer 4 gigabit DDR3 solutions. Also, we shipped samples of our 20-nanometer 8 gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs and began high volume production.","Micron\u2019s Mobile business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $503 million, down 40% from the prior quarter due to delayed customer qualifications and pricing pressure in the eMCP market.","Our non-GAAP operating loss was $21 million or 4% of revenue. We expect some continued challenges during fiscal Q3 as we conclude our customer qualifications, but expect to see improved shipments during our fourth fiscal quarter.","Bit shipments of eMCPs were down approximately 25% as we redirected bits to higher value homes. We saw strong LP DDR3 demand from China in mid tier phones and expect this demand will continue into next year.","Looking forward, our Mobile portfolio continues to position us for growth and success, while we had some missteps in our Mobile qualifications in FQ2, we expect this situation to progressively improve during the calendar year. We continue to ramp our LPDDR4 solutions into both the flagship and high-end segments and will be introducing our innovative 3D NAND into flagships and some higher end phones in the second half of calendar 2016.","The Embedded business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $460 million, down 4% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating income of $87 million or 19% of revenue. The results were primarily impacted by softness in demand from the consumer and industrial multi-market segments, offset by continued strength in the automotive segment.","Looking ahead, we continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC for automotive application that includes Infotainment, Instrument Cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.","In addition, our NOR XTRMFlash product introduced last quarter, continues to gain adoption with key chipset and system on-chip venders within the automotive ecosystem.","Our Industrial multi-market segment, we\u2019re seeing good design-in activity of our M500 IT industrial SSDs and specialty DRAM. And in the Connected Home segment, we\u2019re seeing increased DRAM demand from key set top box customers in both Asia and North America.","Micron Storage business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $901 million, up 2% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $80 million which represents 2% of revenue. We continue to optimize our product mix to address market challenges, particularly in the client and datacenter SSD segments.","Our Trade NAND component bit growth was up 16% quarter-over-quarter and we see demand increasing driven by OEM enterprise solution providers and webscale customers who want to leverage the energy savings and performance gain enabled by Micron flash.","In our Client and Consumer SSD segment, consecutive quarter bit growth was up 13% reflecting accelerated SSD adoption in OEM Ultrabook and Ultrathin PCs. In our Enterprise SSD segment, we\u2019re starting to ship our S600 Series SaaS drive Micron\u2019s first product produced through our strategic partnership with Seagate. We expect to realize revenue from this new product line in Q3 as we move into volume production.","Finally, the Datacenter SSD market segment saw significant downward pricing pressure, driven by TLC enabled competitors and aggressive competition for hyper-scale business. Micron\u2019s participation in this market has been measured and in the second quarter with strategically shifted bit supply from this segment to more favorable market margin opportunities.","Looking at the Company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the second quarter was $2.93 billion which is at the low end of our guided range. Our revenues were impacted by seasonality, timing of product launches, and DRAM and NAND pricing pressure driven primarily by the PC end market.","Gross margin for the quarter was 20%, 5 percentage points below the previous quarter and at the high-end of our guidance. The non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $48 million or $0.05 per share at the favorable end of our guided range.","Gross margin reflects the pricing environment noted earlier, as well as the timing of our leading edge technology migrations. As we\u2019ve noted before, these migrations will generate more substantial cost per bit reductions starting in FQ3 for DRAM and FQ4 for NAND.","As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition and tangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together, these two items represents $0.06 per share for the recently completed quarter.","Looking at results by product line, DRAM revenue decreased 18% compared to the first fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of lower average selling prices and lower volume shipments.","During the second quarter, DRAM bit inventories increased as a result of the 20-nanometer ramp and the timing of product qualifications with certain mobile customers. While we currently expect substantial growth in the volume of DRAM sales in Q3, we also expect an additional inventory increase that will become available for incremental revenue during the following quarters.","The further market adoption of DDR4 products continued in the second quarter and represents approximately 26% of total DRAM volume sales. As a result of decreases in average selling prices, DRAM gross margin was lower than in our previous quarter at approximately 20%, while bit costs remain relatively flat.","Our Non-Volatile Trade revenue decreased 6% compared to the first quarter as a result of the decrease in selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volume. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points as improvements in per bit cost nearly offset the decrease in selling prices.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $583 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guided range. The Company generated operating cash flow of $763 million during the second quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.1 billion.","Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.2 billion and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the $5 billion range net of partner contributions. During the second quarter, we borrowed approximately $425 million with equipment financing and also repaid the third installment on the former LP to creditor debt, bringing the total repayment to approximately half of the total debt.","Moving now to our third fiscal quarter guidance on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following. Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion, gross margin in the range of 16.5% to 19%, operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million, operating income ranging between a loss of $70 million and income of 10 million, and an EPS range between a loss of $0.12 per share and a loss of $0.05 per share based on 1.36 billion diluted shares.","Operationally we\u2019re on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets outlined in our recent Analyst Day. Along these lines, we expect strong double-digit bit growth and related cost reductions for DRAM in fiscal Q3 as a result of the deployment of our 20-nanometer technology. These trends will continue in future quarters along with the benefits of expected improvements in seasonality and further progress on our product qualifications.","Our 3D NAND ramp in manufacturing is proceeding well and we expect to see significant bit growth and cost reductions starting in fiscal Q4.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Ernie. There is one additional thing I\u2019d like to mention before opening up the call for questions. As you know Mark Adams resigned for health reasons at the beginning of the year. Rather than directly replacing his role, we\u2019ve decided to make and are in the process of implementing some changes to our organizational structure that we believe will effectively ensure our ongoing competitiveness.","To summarize, we continue to navigate challenging market conditions, and we\u2019re working to match the timing of our leading edge output with the right mix of customers in end markets. We remain confident in the long-term health of the industry and our strategy to improve our relative competitive position.","Operator, we\u2019re now ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. First question is on the inventory which I know Ernie you talked about increasing this quarter, then potentially again next question. Can you just talk about how you expect to work down inventory going forward and if you need to do anything on the utilization front in order to manage the inventory levels?","Ernie Maddock","No, we don\u2019t expect to do anything on the utilization front and we think the substantial majority of the inventory will be work through in the fourth fiscal quarter with maybe a little bit carrying over into Q1, but we don\u2019t foresee anything beyond that.","Mark Delaney","And then for a follow-up on the gross margin outlook for next quarter, can you just help us better understand some of the mechanics that are driving the decline and if any color between the different segments of how gross margins might trend?","Ernie Maddock","You know I think if you accept that the cost reductions are on track with what we articulated in our Analyst Day, really it sort of boils down to what your assumption is relative to the pricing environment and certainly we\u2019ve embedded certain assumptions in our guided range and really want to make sure that we\u2019re communicating that. The issue relates to an assumption around the pricing environment and not the realization of the cost reduction of the Company.","Mark Delaney","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just provide a little more color on the qualifications on the mobile side. Any issues as to why you sort of missed a window and why won\u2019t penalize you maybe for more than a couple quarters? And then secondly, just on the client SSD business, if I look at numbers in terms of pricing in the last three months or so, you\u2019re seeing pretty sharp ASP declines on average for client SSDs. I\u2019m just curious given -- I know, I understand the cost basis is going down, but relative to those cost declines, how close are you to coming to acceptable margins once you get through the technology transition? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Yes, so first relative to the qualification, obviously when you\u2019re ramping multiple new fabs on new technology nodes and simultaneously transitioning to new densities and new IOs, it\u2019s a complicated thing to keep everything completely aligned with all the various customer requirements and customer product rollouts, particularly in a design-in sort of more sticky environment like we experienced in the mobile segment. So really what we experience is more of a timing issue relative to some of those products and some of those customers, and we\u2019re very confident that the product meets their needs. Its just a matter of now getting them queued up and through the qualification cycle. So, very confident that that we\u2019ve a good handle on the timing and that\u2019s why we continue to build those products and are confident holding the amount of inventory to cover that. Relative to the -- to client SSDs, you\u2019re right. There has been significant pressure there. We have talked about strong double-digit growth in terms of our bit growth on NAND, on a go-forward basis. And given that, significant cost reductions have come with that as well as the strong ability to ramp TLC as we move late into the year with our 3D NAND. So, generally speaking we feel pretty good about where our NAND business goes as we move late into this year and into the next year.","Steven Fox","Okay. So just to be clear, the costs do you still feel like the cost reductions can obviously those margins aren\u2019t going to be above the average, but you feel like you can get into acceptable range and ramp volumes in there by the fourth fiscal quarter, is that fair to say?","Mark Durcan","I\u2019m not going to predict anything relative to ASPs or margins, but I do feel very confident that our 3D NAND ramp and our TLC ramp are as predicted with the associated cost gains that you expect and that we previously discussed.","Steven Fox","Great. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Mark, as you look into the second half, especially with the mix shift, the shifting more towards mobile and served DRAM, how should we think about the die penalty and increase DRAM bits that are coming from your migration to 20-nanometer? You do get a better cost decline, but the results show a mix shift that carries a die penalty. And I\u2019m just trying to better understand those dynamics? And I\u2019ve a follow-up.","Mark Durcan","Yes. So, you\u2019re correct that some of these new IOs have die size penalty associated with them. It\u2019s a mix of anywhere between 0 and 8, 9, 10 percentage, depending on the density and the form factor. I\u2019d say that the mix shift that we see is, yes, we will continue to see as we move through the year. Some increase in the growth in the mix relative to these mobile IDs. Generally speaking, we\u2019re also going to see growth in the server segment as well. So, generally speaking we\u2019ve given you this all-in bit growth guidance of 15% to 25% CAGR over the next couple of years. And that includes the mix effects that we currently anticipate in our business and I think we\u2019re fairly confident in terms of our ability to understand.","Mehdi Hosseini","Sure. And then one question for Ernie, as you go to this inventory adjustments, is there any color you can provide on how we should think about the free cash flow? I know you don\u2019t want to comment on margin, but your working capital requirement is going up. Should we assume that cash burn is going to decrease or increase from the just reported quarter or any other color that you can provide?","Ernie Maddock","You know if you look at the guidance we\u2019ve provided for FQ2 and what we\u2019ve provided for FQ3; they\u2019re not too dissimilar to one another. And if you look at the CapEx discussion we just had where we\u2019re saying we\u2019re still on track to spend about $5 billion and clearly we\u2019ve reported on the first half of the year in terms of CapEx spend. I think you\u2019ve all the information you need to understand within a reasonable estimable range what the cash flow environment will likely look like for the third fiscal quarter.","Mehdi Hosseini","But you just said that your inventories are going to go higher, I\u2019m just -- would that imply that your operating cash is going to be less compared to the February quarter?","Ernie Maddock","No, because if you think about the reverse, let\u2019s say they weren\u2019t going higher, you would have expected those to sell-through into the revenue line, which would have effectively increase the cash flow vis-\u00e0-vis the prior quarter. So, the fact that we -- the guidance does really contemplate if you sort of follow the guide post I\u2019ve just provided to you, they will get you to a pretty good estimate of what is likely to happen on cash flow for the quarter.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Stifel. Your line is open.","Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my question. It seems the automotive market has some good growth and can you give us an idea of what content -- what DRAM content can be in the automobile over the years?","Mark Durcan","Probably not -- it varies greatly depending on model obviously. You would kind of think in terms of all-in memory growth and we think it can be up to $90, $100 a car.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay. And will this be above corporate average gross margin or where does it fit in on the gross margin curve?","Mark Durcan","Yes, the automotive business has been pretty strong for us. And its also we view it as an attractive business, because the sockets are pretty sticky, the life times of the products are longer and so from a total return its very positive market for us.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rajvindra Gill of Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Rajvindra Gill","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding of the gross margin guide. I\u2019m trying to reconcile the fact that as we progress throughout the year, you should be getting higher yields on 20-nanometer and 20-nanometer should represent a higher percentage of the capacity, yet the margins are coming down 300 odd basis points. And so, if you could maybe help me reconcile that, the gross margin guide with relative to the cost reductions, improving as you go throughout the year that will be helpful.","Ernie Maddock","I think its very similar to the answer of one of the earlier questions, which is we\u2019re very confident and provided some pretty clear visibility into what we think is happening with the cost structure. And as I said earlier, we all have an assumption set around what\u2019s going to happen in the pricing environment and so depending on your assumption about that, and we certainly have taken a view that suggest that you\u2019re going to continue to see some of the pressure that we\u2019ve seen over the recent quarters. So the gross margin guide is very, very centered around an ASP assumption versus any doubt about our ability to achieve our cost reductions.","Rajvindra Gill","So why would you -- in the second half, calendar second half, what makes you kind of optimistic that the pricing is going to or with the overall DRAM environment is going to get better and somehow lead to better DRAM pricing? And along those lines, can you talk a little bit about why is the pricing been so weak in the last several quarters and why would it somehow abate going forward, if that\u2019s the case?","Ernie Maddock","You know I\u2019m not sure I said that product would improve at all. So, I don\u2019t think I went there. And as a result of that, I think I said we expect to see continued pricing pressure and certainly if you think about our discussion around our inventory build and that being in the mobile business and the mobile business typically being at the upper end of the gross margin continuum rather than the PC segment, it does help explain some of that thinking that went into our gross margin guide for the quarter.","Rajvindra Gill","And just last question, and what is the basis of the comment that you\u2019re going to improve your competitive position as you move throughout the second half of \u201916, as you just acknowledge that the pricing environment we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, it could get worse, it could get better. Why would your competitive positioning improve in the second half?","Mark Durcan","So there is always a mix piece to the equation that may vary from competitor to competitor, but if you set that aside, I think we\u2019ve outlined that we think our bit growth and our cost downs, particularly in DRAM starting in Q3, and in NAND later in the quarter are going to be significant relative to what you would expect for an industry average and that\u2019s really what drives the fundamental equation relative to relative competitive position irrespective of what market conditions might look like.","Rajvindra Gill","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Farhan Ahmad","Hi. This is Farhan Ahmad asking the question on behalf of John. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is regarding the cost reductions that you just reported for DRAM and NAND. It seems like the NAND cost reductions were pretty significant that came in at 12% quarter-on-quarter whereas DRAM was somewhat less than what I\u2019d have thought like the cost per bit actually went off. Can you talk about what drove the bit cost reduction in NAND? And also on DRAM, like why are we not seeing any benefit from the 20-nanometer transition yet?","Mark Durcan","Well, we had significant bits -- bit growth in NAND in the quarter and typically we expect the cost reduction associated with that. On the DRAM side, what we did I think experience a measurable success relative to the progress we made on our 20-nanometer and the placement of those products with customers. There is a mix impact that is somewhat of a headwind related to the type of memory and in particular LPDDR4 and DDR4 versus LPDDR3 and DDR3. That is a headwind relative to bit growth. We will overwhelm that as we move through the next couple of quarters as we\u2019ve talked about. But that has been a little bit of a headwind and when you layer on top of that some of the inventory growth in high margin products or with a higher margin products typically the mobile piece of the business, that was somewhat of a headwind relative to the cost reduction of DRAM in the current quarter.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And then one question is related to your inventories, like you\u2019re holding little bit longer inventory and given that the mix is such a big factor in -- like on the mobile side, it seems like it\u2019s very specific to the products that you\u2019re designed in. Should we assume like most of the inventory that you\u2019re holding mostly is going to be in the PC or can you hold inventory in other segments of the market as well?","Mark Durcan","No, in particular inventory that we\u2019re holding is primarily been around timing of product qualifications, and while there is a mix of different types of products in that inventory, I wouldn\u2019t direct you to the compute market, in particular, in fact I\u2019d say that mobile is more significant piece of that.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Mark Durcan","Let me just -- additionally its -- we\u2019re not taking what we think is any significant risk here. These are products that we\u2019ve high confidence we\u2019re going to sell-through are pretty fungible among customers.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Hi. Thanks a lot. I had a question on gross margin as well, but I guess I\u2019m just -- I want to make sure that I\u2019ve the right message from what you\u2019re saying. It sounds like that you\u2019re saying that look from the gross margin guidance that it would appear that maybe you\u2019re not getting the cost downs, but in fact you\u2019re. Its just pricing, it\u2019s basically overwhelming the cost downs in the make orders. That is the message?","Mark Durcan","We\u2019re not going to forecast the make order pricing for you. We -- no matter how many times you -- how different ways we go at it, Tim, unfortunately we can\u2019t tell you that, but we can tell you we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our cost downs and our bit growth, being along the lines of what we previously forecast to you and we\u2019re very comfortable with the way everything is progressing in manufacturing. So you got to take that last little piece and plug it in yourself.","Ernie Maddock","Yes, and I\u2019d add to that, Tim, that its important to remember that we\u2019ve always sort of looked at NAND cost reduction as more of a Q4 event with DRAM in Q3 and if you again couple that with the color we\u2019ve provided around inventory and that being predominantly attributable to one of the higher margin segments, I think you will find that if you triangulate around all of this, its pretty easy to understand that what we\u2019re saying around cost reduction is in fact reality.","Timothy Arcuri","Got it. Thank, Ernie. And then, I just have one more, so can you talk about Inotera, May is the first full quarter of the new agreement. Of course you\u2019re in the process of buying them, but the market dynamics have changed a lot since you last talked about the impact. So, can you maybe help us a little bit about handicapping what the impact of the change in the agreement is on the make order guidance?","Mark Durcan","Sure. So, obviously with the change in the market since the time we talked about the acquisition, the benefits whether you assume its the new arrangements or the full consolidation are actually more muted. We still believe that they\u2019re positive, but significantly more muted than the time when we originally announced things and we\u2019d expect from a handicapping point of view FQ1 would be the first time you would see the big uplift and the impacts that we\u2019ve previous talked about relative to margin accretion starting in the third quarter have obviously changed as a result of the change in the market environment.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your question please.","Ada Menaker","Hi. This is Ada calling in for C.J. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the timing of the 1X nano ramp and also the required CapEx there?","Mark Durcan","Yes, not a whole lot to communicate on that yet, other than we\u2019ve started early silicon in the fab in Taichung. And this it\u2019s a process that we don\u2019t believe will result in any significant volume on 110 -- when we call a 110 series or 1X nanometer node until we get into 2017.","Ada Menaker","Thank you. And in terms of the financing for the Inotera acquisition, any updates there?","Mark Durcan","You know that\u2019s moving along as we expected. So there is no new news from the last time we shared things publicly.","Ada Menaker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joseph Moore","Great. Thank you. I wanted to clarify one thing on the slide, it says the capital expenditures is 5.3% to 5.8% net of the partner contribution, is it still $5 billion net of partner contribution, is that right?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, it is still $5 billion net of partner contribution.","Joseph Moore","Okay, great. And then with the mobile issue, is that something that you were able to anticipate -- did you know that three months ago, when you talk about the quarter, when you plan the fab or did that surprise you over the course of the quarter and what happened for kind of like-for-like pricing in the mobile space, outside of that issue.","Mark Durcan","We ended up in a slightly different place relative to what we saw through relative to mobile, that is fair to say. Relative to mobile pricing, down mid single digits in the quarter we finish.","Joseph Moore","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open.","Vijay Rakesh","Yes, hi guys. Just looking at the make order, the softness in the gross margin side, when you -- as you ramp your 20-nanometer LPDDR4 once it gets qualified, let\u2019s say, and 3D NAND, do you expect the margins to improve once they start shipping. Obviously, most of it is [indiscernible] inventory now. Can you get us some color there?","Mark Durcan","You know we continue to focus around our cost and our cost competitiveness. We really don\u2019t get in the business of forecasting margins, because there is a pricing environment piece of that which we\u2019ve very little control over. So, we can talk clearly about what we think is going to happen on the cost front, we\u2019ve done that. I\u2019m happy to reiterate that. But margin is not something we\u2019re in the business of doing.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And on the 3D NAND side, I guess just looking at 3D NAND and LPDDR4, what do you expect the mix -- what does that mix here and where do you see the mix, let\u2019s say by exiting calendar of \u201916?","Mark Durcan","While we talk about being in -- being over 50% 3D NAND in the fall, and so if you want more precision than that, probably not ready to go there yet, other than to say we continue to be very happy with the way that technology is rolling out in manufacturing. We are very satisfied with the quality and the -- and our ability to apply TLC versions of our 3D NAND. And that will provide an added boost really later in the fall and into the beginning of 2017.","Vijay Rakesh","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Li of Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Justin Li","Thanks for taking the question. This is Justin calling on behalf of Tristan Gerra. My first question would be, could you share your view on that recent memory investment from China?","Mark Durcan","Well, its -- I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got anything really new to say about that. I think we\u2019ve said before that we anticipated that clearly China was interested in being the memory market and that they would look for ways to find partners or to grow organically. We\u2019ve now heard about significant investments in organic growth. But we would remind everyone a yes, that we believe that there are significant technology hurdles and intellectual property requirements in terms of being a major player in the memory space and we think its going to be a challenging road for the -- for organic and will take sometime.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. The next question is regarding the 3D cross point that you will start to sell next year, which customers are you going to sell to and how much cannibalization do you think it will bring to DRAM and NAND?","Mark Durcan","Yes, its what -- first of all, you\u2019re right. This year we\u2019re short of an enablement mode, and we\u2019re working with a number of different end market segments. Some customers then have significant interest in mobile, some customers in enterprise, or big data applications, I mean mobile for low power -- from the low power benefits. Early on as we ramp this technology we expect cannibalization to be low to zero. Over time, as the technology matures and drive to significantly higher volumes. I\u2019d expect some of that volume to come out of what otherwise would have been DRAM and maybe even eventually what otherwise have been other types of Non-Volatile memory. But generally speaking, this is a differentiated technology that will grow the size of the overall memory market at least over the next two, three, four years.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jagadish Iyer of Redstone. Your line is open.","Jagadish Iyer","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Mark. First on the, you heard on the DRAM side, the bit growth was substantially less in the last quarter. And you did say that in the fiscal third quarter you\u2019re going to have significant chunk of it. What gives you the confidence that you\u2019re going to be ramping successfully on that, given that the historically you\u2019ve had some challenges on that. Can you just elaborate your conviction level on what kind of step up on the big growth are we going to see in the second half between calendar third quarter and fourth quarter and then into 2017?","Mark Durcan","Yes, so we don\u2019t give you bit growth projection for either production or sales anymore, since we are down guiding all the financial numbers. But I think the broader interpretation of your question is what are we confident, we\u2019re going to have the bit growth that we\u2019re baking into our models and the answer there is we\u2019re now a month of the quarter, so a significant part of the output is already out and another significant part of the output is already running in the fab. We are seeing a month of yield data already. And we just reinforce what we said in the last Analyst Day presentation that the ramp is really at that time was and continues to outperform any previous new technology ramp in terms of yield maturity. And so, we just really like the way its going. We are seeing strong progress in two fabs in parallel and we\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019re going to deliver on the bit growth and associated cost improvements that we forecast to you previously.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay. Just on the cost reduction, how should we be thinking about in terms of is it going to be -- how, is there a cost reduction go for 20-nanometer going to be different from the cost reduction, the 25-nanometer, can you just elaborate on that or is it going to be similar?","Mark Durcan","Well, what we\u2019ve said is that over a -- the CAGR that we provided which is 16 and 17 that we\u2019re looking at somewhere in the realm of 25% cost down versus 20-nanometer, that\u2019s more of a cash cost down and that if you take total costs, all then including depreciation which we will encounter to a higher degree of 20-nanometer versus what we encountered at 25. We are looking at somewhere between 15% and 25%, so it will obviously in the early days it will be less, but as we get and ramp to mature yield, you will expect to see some right in the center of that range.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chin of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Chin","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple on NAND flash, if I could. First, I just wanted to review a quick the cost reduction strategy for assisting products, in particular, as their coal mentioned of TLC. I just want to make sure is that TLC 2D NAND or were you referring to a 2D planer TLC as well as part of the lower cost NAND that\u2019s going to go into SSD right this year?","Mark Durcan","So, we\u2019ve planer, TLC NAND in the marketplace today. But we -- I think we commented earlier that, the SSD, the client SSD and consumer SSD market has been fairly challenged from a pricing perspective and so we\u2019ve been measured in terms of how we approach that end market? I think the more important thing is that yes, we believe that as we move to 3D NAND and very significant percentage of our output will eventually become 3D and that\u2019s just drive significant cost reduction above and beyond the conversion to 3D itself.","Steven Chin","Okay. Thanks, Mark. And I just -- as my follow up for the Gen2 3D NAND process that you mentioned will be going into, I guess, going through the fabs a little bit later this summer, Can you comment on whether the tool set for this Gen2 will be identical to the Gen 1, that you\u2019re already outfitting in your fabs or will it requires some incremental spending on top of that? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","So, we actually already have Gen 2 in a manufacturing fab. What I commented on was that we\u2019d start sort of early production in the summer. So, we\u2019ve -- we actually have product range from manufacturing fabs today on Gen 2, and obviously like the way that\u2019s going as well. As to the equipment set, its not identical, but it is similar equipment. In some cases more of it, that are very, very similar tools.","Steven Chin","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your question please.","Romit Shah","Yes, thanks. Just back to inventories, it just seems from my perspective that less demand gets a lot better. Pricing is going to continue to be weak until Micron and the DRAM industry overall cuts production. So, I guess, my question is, what will it take for that to happen?","Romit Shah","We don\u2019t have any plans that cut production to date.","Mark Durcan","Mark, you said in \u2026","Romit Shah","You can see if others divide enough.","Romit Shah","I mean, is your point that its got to come from the market share leader first?","Mark Durcan","Well, I think -- well, first of all, we\u2019re not going to do it unless we see negative cash margins, because we haven\u2019t added any incremental capacity. And we think we\u2019d be foolish to be the first ones to take capacity off, given that fact set.","Ernie Maddock","Yes its point to remember how much of our cost structure is fixed. And so to Mark\u2019s point as long as we\u2019re getting a contribution to that cost structure, that fixed cost structure, it\u2019s a really ill advised move to be unilaterally cutting production.","Romit Shah","So the other thing I think, just the sort of temporarily the assumption in your question. DRAM CapEx is going to be down about 30% this year. So I don\u2019t think its necessary all doom and gloom as we look at -- what we think supply growth is going to be going forward and what we think demand growth is, segment by segment. We kind of already gave you our opinion, which is its going to take a little bit of time, but we think that this is going to be a healthy environment again.","Romit Shah","I guess, the prevailing view a year-ago was that all the players in the DRAM industry were focused on maximizing profit, but today the focus seems to be on market share and Mark, maybe you could just give us your perspective on what you think happening in terms of this competitive dynamics.","Mark Durcan","Our focus isn\u2019t on market share. Our focus is on making sure that we\u2019ve deployed equivalent advanced technology, at least equivalent advanced technology to our competitor, so that we\u2019re not incentivising others to play for market share. And we think that\u2019s just really a prudent thing to do as managers of our business that we should make sure that we\u2019re putting in place efficient manufacturing production capacity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re very, very focused on.","Romit Shah","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Ing of MKM Partners. Your question please.","Ian Ing","Yes, thank you. So, in your prepared comments you talked about early signs of a demand recovery in China. Could you talk more about that? I\u2019m assuming it excludes mobile, given some of the qualification issues?","Mark Durcan","You know that comment was really a specific to the networking segment of our CNBU business. And we start -- we\u2019re starting to see a little bit more activity there, maybe early parts of next generation infrastructure rollout. And we\u2019d expect that to continue for a number of years.","Ian Ing","Okay. So, largely networking then. Okay, my follow-up is expectations for DRAM bit growth in fiscal \u201917 under 20%, I mean has that thinking changed since the Analyst Day, because you did provide that two year CAGR 20% to 30% over two years. I mean, do we go to the low end of the range or could you go under that?","Mark Durcan","No, we still think that the range that we provided is accurate over that timeframe. The industry we think will be less than 20% in terms of industry bit growth.","Ian Ing","Thanks for the clarification. So, you\u2019re implying you could outgrow in fiscal \u201917, outgrow the industry?","Mark Durcan","Yes, that\u2019s as a result of deploying advanced technology, not adding wafers for, are targeting some specific market.","Ian Ing","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Durcan","And operator, I think we\u2019ve got one more question, then we will be done.","Operator","Yes sir. And the question comes from the line of Nilay Mehta of KLS. Your line is open.","Nilay Mehta","Hey guys. I\u2019ve some question, a few from me, first sort of on the end market. It seems like PCs were pretty weak in the first quarter, just seems all the data points since that came through your numbers. Just want to see what you guys are thinking going forward what you guys have seen from your customers on the PC side and also on the mobile side, it sounds like you guys have some inventory builds. I just want to get a little bit color on sort of what cause that inventory build and how you guys see that playing out? And then my last question is on the Inotera financing. You say there is no updates, but given where the stock is right now, would you contemplate doing the equity portion in that given again where your stock price is now in the amount of shares you guys have, would have to issue to finance that 1 million RPs[ph]? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","So I will take the first two and I will let Ernie to come back to the Inotera financing. Relative to PCs, yes, it continues to be weak. We think maybe down mid single-digits for the year, DRAM content maybe up about 10% for the year. We\u2019re not expecting any big things out of PC demand when we give you our view as the demand growth for the year across all the various segments. But once you get outside of PCs, growing obviously slower than overall market supply for DRAM, and mobile growing maybe right around the market supply for DRAM. You got all these other segments that we think will out script supply growth servers, automotive, etcetera, etcetera. So, generally speaking we do believe that in aggregate things are going to take care of themselves. Relative to mobile inventory, again its primarily -- there is a mix of things in inventory, but we did indicate that a chunk of it is mobile and a lot of that just revolves around timing of product qualifications that we\u2019ve, a high confidence in, we\u2019re just building inventory in advance of those qualifications and so that we\u2019re prepared to ship that product out when the qualifications come through. And Ernie, you want to take Inotera?","Ernie Maddock","Sure. So, again similar to what we said before, we\u2019re looking at a wide variety of options for that remaining $1 billion and as the time to close approaches, we will be looking at the alternatives that make the most sense to us, given where we\u2019re at the time.","Mark Durcan","All right. I want to thank everyone for their participation on the call today and for their continued interest in Micron. Obviously, I\u2019m still bullish of the memory industry. I like the way we\u2019re executing and with that I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Ivan to close us up.","Ivan Donaldson","Thanks, Mark. If you just bear with me, I\u2019ve to reread then Safe Harbor language real quickly. I need to -- let's see. During the course of this call, we may have made forward-looking statements regarding the Company and the industry.

Good afternoon everyone. In the first quarter, we demonstrated solid execution, further improved our balance sheet, and began executing on our $10 billion share buyback program. We delivered strong profitability despite revenue headwinds from the inventory adjustments at several customers, and industry-wide CPU shortages.","Our results also reflect our success in further diversifying our business as evidenced by record sales in our mobile, automotive, and industrial businesses in the quarter. As we enter calendar 2019, we are seeing weakening demand from our customers. As a result, we are taking decisive actions, including a meaningful reduction in our fiscal 2019 CapEx plan, in both DRAM and NAND that will materially reduce our supply bit growth. I'll provide more details on these items later in the call after first reviewing the highlights of the quarter.","I'll start with our execution progress. We are focused on improving our cost structure and increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio, both of which provide immediate benefits and strengthen Micron's ability to drive long term profitable growth.","Our cost reductions in DRAM and NAND have meaningfully outpaced the industry over the last three years. Our progress on advanced technology gives us confidence that we will deliver healthy year-over-year cost declines in DRAM and NAND in fiscal 2019, even after taking into account the supply and CapEx changes, which I referenced earlier.","In the first quarter, we achieved crossover of 1X nanometer DRAM shipments, and started revenue shipments of 1Y nanometer products. Our 1Y year ramp is ahead of schedule, and we remain on track for meaningful production by the fiscal third quarter. We're also making excellent progress on our 1Z technology, which leverages our leadership in advanced materials and cost effective lithography techniques.","In NAND, we continue to lead with our QLC product offerings, and have introduced both consumer QLC and VME SSDs and enterprise QLC SATA SSDs. In the first quarter, we started shipping 96-layer NAND products. Yields on 96-layer are ahead of plan. We remain focused on increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio and investing in differentiated products for our customers.","In DRAM, we introduced our 1Y nanometer 12-gigabit low power DRAM which offers the highest density available for the mobile market. We are seeing strong demand for this product as the market continues to move toward higher densities.","In NAND, high-value solutions now represent over 50% of our NAND bits, which is an important milestone for us. The improving mix of high-value solutions increases our gross profit opportunity and provides better margin stability. The strength of our high-value solutions this quarter, which was driven by managed NAND products, helped us maintain overall NAND gross margins above 45%, despite industry oversupply.","We strengthened our number one share position in SATA enterprise SSDs, gaining about three percentage points of market share sequentially according to industry reports. In addition to the QLC consumer and VME SSD, mentioned earlier, we also introduced the industry's first one terabyte TLC NVMe automotive SSD in the first quarter. We are working to further expand our NVMe product portfolio and plan to introduce SSDs targeting client, enterprise, and cloud markets through the course of calendar 2019.","Looking ahead, we expect the SSD market opportunity will continue to shift from SATA to NVMe. Fiscal 2019 will be a year of transition for our SSD portfolio and we expect our SSD share gains to resume in fiscal 2020.","In the meantime, the growth of our high-value NAND solutions in fiscal 2019 will be driven by our mobile managed NAND products, where we believe we have significant opportunity to increase share. In the first quarter, we shipped multiple high-capacity, high-performance UFS solutions, nearly tripling our bit shipments quarter-over-quarter.","We continue to make good progress in developing high-value solutions using our 3D XPoint technology and plan to introduce differentiated products towards the end of calendar 2019 as previously discussed.","Our conviction in the opportunities ahead is reflected in our October announcement that we intend to exercise our option to acquire Intel's interest in the IMFT Facility in Lehi, Utah, early in calendar 2019.","Now, turning to end markets, I will start first with mobile, where we set records for revenue, gross margins, and operating margins in the first fiscal quarter. In addition to strong seasonal sales, we benefited from major product wins with several customers, which is driving our managed NAND share gains.","We are seeing strong demand elasticity in this market and within our MCP portfolio, our average NAND density was up over 25% sequentially and over 150% year-on-year. Content growth also continues to do well in mobile DRAM with more than 25% growth in density per unit shipped on a year-on-year basis.","We expect content growth to continue in mobile devices, driven by broader use of artificial intelligence, and the increasing number of cameras in the average smartphone. These elements will become pervasive, while the industry readies for 5G implementation.","In data center markets, we saw reduced revenue coming off a record-setting fiscal fourth quarter, due primarily to inventory adjustments at our customers. We expect this headwind will persist for a couple of quarters. We are seeing some cloud customers go through a digestion period following very strong growth over the last two years.","We believe we are still in the early innings of cloud growth and long-term end customer demand trends remain strong in this market. Our engagement with our customers continues to be deep and now includes collaboration on our 3D XPoint product roadmap.","Higher density DRAM products are seeing stronger demand across the data center market. Revenue from our high-density 64-gigabyte DRAM modules grew more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We are focused on the upcoming industry transition from eight to 16-gigabit DRAM, and expect to start sampling our new 16-gigabit DRAM by our fiscal third quarter.","In graphics, we started volume ramp of our high-performance GDDR6 memory and are working closely with our key customers in this segment. Higher than normal inventories in gaming cards and the fall-off in crypto-related demand, created revenue headwinds, which we expect to continue for a couple more quarters.","Looking ahead, we see broadening interest in high performance graphics memory for AI enablement in segments like data center and automotive. Our product leadership in GDDR6 is already creating new opportunities in these segments.","Turning to markets requiring our long life cycle products, in the fiscal first quarter, we had record revenue in auto and industrial markets with a sequential expansion in gross margins.","Strength in automotive continues to be driven by increasing demand for in-vehicle infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems. As a result, we see strong demand for our latest generation of automotive products.","In November, we announced a collaboration with BMW to define and validate next-generation automotive solutions. This is another proof point of Micron's leadership in automotive and the growing criticality of memory and storage to leading-edge automotive applications.","Turning to our DRAM industry outlook, as I've mentioned previously, DRAM demand weakened through the course of our fiscal first quarter. Since the start of this fiscal second quarter, the weakening demand trend has continued and our near-term visibility is limited.","Due to a lengthy period of rising DRAM prices, we believe some of our customers had decided to carry higher than normal inventory levels and as DRAM supply caught up with demand, these customers are bringing down their inventory levels. Smartphone unit demand is also continuing to weaken, particularly at a high end in what is seasonally slow quarter for mobile.","Lastly, we are continuing to see the impact of CPU shortages. While our customers and market demand in segments like industrial, cloud, enterprise, and client compute is healthy, this inventory adjustment period will contribute to weaker demand conditions in DRAM that will likely persist through the first half of calendar 2019.","We now expect DRAM bit demand growth for the industry in calendar 2019 at approximately 16% compared with our prior expectation of approximately 20%. Even after factoring in the recent CapEx cuts publicly announced across the industry, DRAM supply growth is tracking above our view of demand growth in calendar 2019.","Given this supply\/demand dynamic, we are taking decisive actions to lower our DRAM bit output growth to approximately 15% for calendar 2019 versus our prior plan of around 20% bit growth. These actions include a significant reduction to our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019.","Based on our current demand estimates, our DRAM bit shipments for the fiscal second quarter will decline sequentially, but more importantly are likely to be flat to down on a year-over-year basis as well consistent with a weak quarter for the memory industry and significantly below the long-term demand growth rate. This shows that inventory adjustments by our customers are well underway. Barring weaker macroeconomic conditions, we expect our DRAM bit demand to grow sequentially in our fiscal third quarter.","Looking beyond fiscal Q3, as we enter the second half of calendar 2019, we expect a healthier demand environment alongside an improved industry supply picture, which should contribute to improved financial performance.","In NAND, while the inventory levels at customers are in better shape, NAND suppliers appear to have elevated levels of inventory. The transition from planar to 3D NAND in the industry and successful ramp of 64-layer across the NAND manufacturers has resulted in oversupply in the market over the last several quarters.","We currently expect calendar 2019 NAND industry bit demand growth to be approximately 35% with ongoing impacts due to client compute CPU shortages and weaker high end smartphone unit demand.","Even after taking into account recently publicly announced NAND CapEx reductions for calendar 2019, our assessment is that the NAND industry supply growth will exceed industry demand growth in the coming calendar year. We are, therefore, lowering our 2019 planned NAND bit growth and further reducing our fiscal 2019 NAND CapEx.","We now expect our calendar 2019 NAND supply bit growth to be meaningfully reduced from prior expectations and expect our bit shipment growth to be in line with the industry demand at approximately 35%. We also expect NAND demand to accelerate in the second half of the calendar year as demand elasticity kicks in for the mobile, enterprise, and client markets.","Given our attractive cost structure on leading-edge NAND and DRAM, in this market environment, we will manage pricing and carry inventory as necessary to optimize our profitability. We are taking decisive action on the supply side to manage our business in a prudent fashion with an eye towards delivering a robust return on our investments.","Our actions will significantly reduce our fiscal 2019 CapEx and allow us to continue delivering strong profitability and healthy free cash flow while investing in our strategic priorities as we position Micron to capitalize on the exciting growth opportunities for the company.","I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide financial details of our fiscal first quarter and guidance for the second quarter.","David Zinsner","Thanks Sanjay. Micron delivered strong results in our fiscal first quarter, including double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue, gross profits, and earnings per share. While our near-term outlook has become more challenging, the actions taken to improve our cost structure and increase our mix of high-value solutions will ensure that our profitability profile remains strong. Moreover, Micron's financial position remains healthy with an improved net cash position and with total liquidity reaching our target levels.","Total fiscal first quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, up 16% from the prior year and down 6% from the record fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue was adversely impacted by inventory adjustments at key customers in the cloud, graphics, and enterprise markets. Offsetting these headwinds, we delivered record revenue in the mobile, industrial, and automotive markets.","DRAM represented 68% of total company revenue in the fiscal first quarter. DRAM revenue increased 18% year-over-year and declined 9% from the prior quarter. On a blended basis, DRAM ASPs declines high single-digits percent compared to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were relatively flat.","Trade NAND revenue represented 28% of total company revenue in the fiscal first quarter. Trade NAND revenue increased 17% year-over-year and declined 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our overall NAND ASP declined in the low to mid-teens percent and shipment quantities increased in the low to mid-teens percent compared to the prior quarter.","Now, turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the compute and networking business unit was $3.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year and down 17% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by the impact of inventory adjustments at some of our customers in the graphics, enterprise and cloud markets.","The mobile business unit delivered a strong quarter with record revenue of $2.2 billion, revenue increased 62% year-over-year and 17% from the prior quarter. Revenue growth was driven by the continued strength of our low-power DRAM offerings and share gains in our mobile managed NAND business with several leading handset customers.","Embedded business unit revenue of $933 million was up 12% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. The automotive and industrial business -- businesses had record revenue, driven by strong sales of our DRAM and NOR products.","And finally, turning to the storage business unit, or SBU, fiscal first quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 17% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline in revenue was driven by weaker pricing and the ongoing transition from SATA to NVMe SSDs. The impact of this transition will continue through calendar 2019. Our strategy to move bits from SBU components to high-value solutions in mobile is also contributing to a decline in revenue for SBU.","The consolidated gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 59%, up 360 basis points from the prior year and down approximately 230 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes a 120 basis point impact from 3D XPoint underutilization costs.","During the last few months, we successfully leveraged our global supply chain to mitigate the impact of the China trade tariffs to less than 50 basis points to our consolidated fiscal first quarter gross margin.","We expect to be able to mitigate approximately 90% of the impact from tariffs starting in January 2019. We believe that Micron will not be directly impacted by any expansion of trade tariffs to additional product categories.","Operating expenses were $783 million, slightly above our guidance, mainly due to higher than expected prequalification expenses associated with new product introductions.","Looking forward, as our joint development work with Intel comes to a conclusion around the end of this fiscal year; the R&D cost sharing between the companies will naturally reduce and come to an end.","In the fiscal first quarter, Intel's share of joint R&D expenses was approximately $30 million. We expect that our R&D expenses will continue to increase in the coming quarters due to the combination of these declining R&D contributions from Intel as well as increased investments in future technologies and high-value solutions across our portfolio.","We continue to drive strong profitability in the fiscal first quarter with operating income of $3.9 billion, representing 49% of revenue. This margin is up three percentage points year-over-year and down three percentage points from the fiscal fourth quarter.","As previously mentioned, the improvements that Micron has made over the prior several years have resulted in structurally higher margins. The tax rate for the fiscal first quarter was 10% and we expect our fiscal year 2019 tax rate to be around 11%.","Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal first quarter totaled $2.97, up from $2.45 in the year ago quarter and down from $3.53 in the prior quarter. We commenced our capital return program in the fiscal first quarter with the repurchase of $1.8 billion of common stock, representing a reduction of approximately 42 million shares or about 3.5% of shares outstanding.","We expect to remain active with our stock buybacks in the fiscal second quarter, as we continue to make progress on our $10 billion repurchase program by returning at least 50% of our ongoing free cash flows to shareholders.","Turning to cash flows and capital spending, in the fiscal first quarter, we generated $4.8 billion in cash from operations, representing 61% of revenue. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions was $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the prior quarter.","In the fiscal first quarter, our free cash flow was approximately $2.3 billion, up about $600 million from the year ago quarter and down approximately $750 million from the prior quarter. We deployed approximately 80% of the quarter's free cash flow towards our share repurchase program.","Even with the substantial outlay for share repurchases, we ended the fiscal quarter in a record net cash position of $3.1 billion with approximately $7.2 billion in cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash and $4.1 billion in debt.","While we largely completed our deleveraging activities in fiscal year 2018, we further reduced our debt balance in the quarter by approximately $500 million through the settlement of outstanding convertible note redemptions of $160 million and other scheduled payments.","Overall, our solid balance sheet, strong cash flow, and robust liquidity put us in an excellent position to execute on our capital returns program.","Prior to issuing our fiscal second quarter guidance, I'd like to provide some context for our outlook. Due to the weaker demand environment, we expect fiscal second quarter sequential bit shipments to be down meaningfully for both NAND and DRAM. Given the weaker near-term outlook, we are lowering our CapEx plans to a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion for fiscal 2019.","At the midpoint, this represents a $1.25 billion reduction from our prior guidance and our front end equipment CapEx is now down year-on-year. We'll continue to remain flexible with capital spending to respond to market conditions.","With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal second quarter is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.3 billion, and gross margins to be in the range of 50% to 53%. Operating expenses are expected to be $800 million, plus or minus $25 million.","As we execute on longer term growth investments, we're actively managing OpEx by implementing expense controls across the company, including tighter controls on headcount, holiday work schedule slowdowns, and reductions in discretionary spending.","Based on a share count of approximately 1.15 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.75, plus or minus $0.10.","In closing, Micron continues to deliver solid financial results on a stronger performance foundation. We are making progress on all of our key initiatives including our high-value solutions product portfolio, our cost profile, capital return program, and financial structure with a record net cash position and $9.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the fiscal first quarter.","While near-term market conditions are challenging, we are taking appropriate steps to manage production and spending in order to deliver healthy, profitability, and cash flows. There is no doubt Micron remains in the strongest financial position in the company's history as we transition to next-generation technologies and products.","I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Dave. While we end calendar 2018 on the heels of unprecedented profitability and revenue for both Micron and the industry, we do believe we are entering a period of weaker market conditions. We are taking prudent actions to adapt our manufacturing plans to the changing demand environment.","While we are implementing expense controls, we are also continuing to invest in our technology and cost competitiveness as well as strengthening our portfolio of high-value solutions.","Memory and storage have become essential ingredients to the value created by the data economy and it is this added value that is driving a virtual cycle of long-term growth and innovation. We continue to believe that the memory industry is structurally stronger with more diversified demand drivers and moderating supply growth capability.","Micron is better positioned than ever before to win in this environment with our strong balance sheet and the structural improvements we have made to our operating model in the past several years. We believe 2019 will be a year of solid profitability and I look forward to sharing our results over the quarters ahead.","We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]","And our first question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.","Tim Arcuri","Thank you. Sanjay, I was wondering if you could help quantify the inventory at your big hyper scale customers. It sounds like in aggregate its maybe two months. So, I'm wondering if you can help with that number. Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, inventory at our customers and this is -- customers in various segments of our market, some of those customers are carrying higher levels of inventory, and that inventory level varies from customer to customer we believe.","And our assessment is that inventory adjustments will take couple of quarters for it to be corrected, for it to work through the system entirely and, of course, we continue to work with our customers in the meantime, in terms of understanding their longer term demand requirements. And certainly, our customers are indicating optimism towards the demand requirements in the second half of the year.","And especially, as inventory adjustments work through the system and as supply cuts, the effect of those come through the industry, as well as second half of the calendar year tends to be seasonally stronger compared to the first half of the year, we do expect that by the second half of the year, we'll have an environment that will be improved stronger compared to the first half of the year.","And just keep in mind that the long-term demand trends in our end markets of cloud, client, enterprise, graphics all of these end markets, the trends continue to be strong, needing more memory and more storage ultimately.","We're just going through an air pocket here related to primarily inventory adjustments as well as some seasonal, weak mobile demand, including mobile demand on the high end smartphones that is impacting some of our near-term visibility as well as the near-term outlook.","Tim Arcuri","Thank you for that. And then I guess just as a quick follow-up, Dave. So, I think maybe the surprise in the guidance that the bit shipments are down, I think you said, meaningfully for both NAND and DRAM. I'm wondering, what that means for inventories? Are you going to ship out of inventory? Or are you cutting utilization? Can you sort of walk us through that? Thank you.","David Zinsner","So, we are reducing our production for both DRAM and NAND. As Sanjay indicated, from a DRAM perspective, we're bringing bit supply growth down to 15% approximately in calendar year 2019.","For NAND, we're also bringing the production down meaningfully and we did indicate that we would ship close to demand for NAND and we think that demand is about 35%. So, obviously, there will be periods of time, where we do have inventory increasing for some period of time and then, of course, it will adjust down through the years as we -- as those demand and supply numbers get more aligned.","In the first quarter, we had days of inventory up to 107 days, I'm very comfortable with 107 days. This is very low cost product that we're putting on the balance sheet. There is no risk around obsolescence, it's part -- it's very likely that we'll go up again next quarter; again, I'm very comfortable with that. But I think over the long-term, we'll have it more aligned with ultimately where we want it to be.","Tim Arcuri","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Dave, just relative to the guidance for OpEx in February quarter of $800 million, plus or minus $25 million, does that now reflect, what we should think about as a fully burdened OpEx as you kind of move away from the shared cost with Intel?","And relative to the $6 billion of operational efficiency gains, you talked about at the Analyst Day, this past summer, how does that fit in with this OpEx guide? Because this is about $200 million more OpEx per quarter than we saw at similar revenue levels back in sort of 2016, 2017, and it's about $300 million above per quarter what we saw kind of in the 2015 sort of correction?","David Zinsner","Yes, good question. So, we did guide $800 million for OpEx in the second quarter, plus or minus $25 million. That's probably -- that's certainly not fully burdened. We had about $30 million of benefit in the first fiscal quarter related to Intel's contribution through R&D expenses. It will be a little bit less in the second quarter, but over the course of the rest of the year will kind of phase down. So, that certainly will elevate the OpEx in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter.","And also, we're not -- while we are certainly managing expenses prudently and we are taking steps in terms of reducing discretionary spending and just monitoring our headcount very closely, we still are making the necessary investments on the product side and the technology side. This is, as Sanjay mentioned, an air pocket, we don't want to in any way, impact our long-term strategy for some sort of near-term event. So, OpEx will likely go up a little bit.","It's a fair point on the OpEx. I would say, if you look at the guidance for the second quarter or even with the revenue guidance we gave relative to what the first quarter was like, if you take the kind of midpoint of the earnings number, and the midpoint of the revenue guidance number, you'll get kind of 38% plus operating margin. So, that is a really good number obviously. It's a number of, in my previous company; we were kind of aspirationally trying to get to.","So, it's a very good operation -- operating margin number. And I think it reflects the fact that we achieved the $6 billion of improvements that we said we would make at the Analyst Day.","We still think we have more work to do in terms of driving the mix towards high-value solutions in terms of improving our cost competitiveness, both on the front-end and on the back-end side. So, there is more to come, there is another $3 billion that we committed and we feel very good about that.","John Pitzer","And then as my follow-up for Sanjay, can you just walk us through the strategic puts and takes of building inventory into the February quarter as opposed to trying to let those bits out into the marketplace and let elasticity sort of take over? Is this sort of intangible reflection of your view that this will be relatively short-lived a couple of quarters? And what would you need to see before you would think that inventory build was too risky?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, I think our inventory, our cost structure is very good, both on DRAM as well as on the NAND side. And so we are definitely prepared that in terms of managing our overall profitability, which is absolutely our primary focus, that we'll manage pricing and manage inventory accordingly as necessary. If inventory has to be carried over, we will carry it over because the demand in NAND will kick-in with elasticity.","In DRAM, the inventory consumption with our customers will occur; supply cuts will be driving return to stronger demand environment compared to -- in the second half compared to first half. So, we will be using inventory as a lever to ultimately manage for the best profitability of the company.","And certainly, be prepared, use that inventory as necessary to also capitalize on the second half opportunities. And our focus really will also remain that in terms of our CAGR, in terms of output growth to be aligned with demand CAGR, and we'll of course from time-to-time use inventory as a lever to manage the profitability of our business and, of course, manage our customers' requirements as well.","John Pitzer","Thank you.","David Zinsner","Thank you, John.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, can you talk about what you're thinking in terms of cost down efforts both for DRAM and NAND, particularly as you move to higher-value solutions changing mix, including 1Y, 1Z as well as 96 layers in the 2019 timeframe?","Sanjay Mehrotra","With respect to the cost structure, we continue to be in very good position, as we said that for our fiscal year 2019, we'll have healthy cost reductions, both for NAND as well as DRAM.","And you're of course right to note that as we increase the mix of our high-value solutions, for example, over the longer term as we increase our SSD mix or increase our managed NAND solutions, those do tend to incur higher costs. But they also bring higher margins, higher profitability, higher pricing associated with them as well. So, cost wise, we are in good shape.","C.J. Muse","That's helpful. And I guess, as a follow-up, a question for you Dave. I think in the past you've talked about wanting to have liquidity including gross cash and revolver of roughly one year CapEx, which would basically put you on the screws here. So, the question is how to think about incremental free cash flow generation? And what percentage of that would be used for buybacks?","David Zinsner","Yes, good question C.J. So, we contribute -- let's start with the -- we're at about $9.7 billion of liquidity when you count the cash that we have on the balance sheet, plus the $2.5 billion revolver we have. So, we're in, as you point out, very good shape relative to where our target liquidity would be.","You saw a pretty healthy return of cash to shareholders in the first quarter. About 80% of our free cash flow went to shareholders in the form of the buyback, and really, the rest went to further deleverage the balance sheet.","There's not a ton of deleveraging that will go on through the rest of the year, quite honestly. And so I would expect us to be -- continue to be good buyers of the stock, so to speak, through the next three quarters and contribute a high portion of our free cash flow in the form of a buyback.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Mark Newman with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Mark Newman","Yes, thanks for taking my question. First question really, I'd like to ask on the supply adjustments you're making, you're taking down the guidance for both DRAM and NAND reduction. You mentioned about some of that being inventory, but you also mentioned some of that being some reduction adjustments.","It would be useful to understand a bit more about that. For example, is that reduction of utilization? Is that a no more capacity additions or what is that? Because some of your competitors have been pushing out some of their capacity additions and so it would be useful to understand what Micron is doing here, on the capacity adjustments to get this slightly lower bit growth that you are forecasting for calendar 2019?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, certainly, we are taking actions, a range of actions and we won't really get into any specifics here in terms of what actions we are taking to reduce our output. You earlier mentioned about inventory. I mean, of course, we will carry inventory as necessary to manage the profitability. But important thing to understand is that we are taking decisive actions in terms of reducing our production output both in NAND as well as in DRAM. And that's the contributor to the $1.25 billion reduction in CapEx compared to our prior guidance. And of course, our intention here is to align our supply output in line with the industry demand trends and we feel very good about the actions we have taken.","In DRAM, we've pointed out that compared to our prior expectations of 20% supply bit growth in calendar 2019; we have taken actions now to reduce our output to provide a 15% supply output growth on a year-over-year basis. And in DRAM as well, we have taken actions to adjust our output so that our shipments will match with our demand that we expect to be around 35% in 2019.","And just want to be very clear as we have always said, that we are not adding any new wafer capacity. We are -- the CapEx that we discussed today, the lowered CapEx that we discussed, which on a wafer equipment basis is a reduction from fiscal year 2018 CapEx is all going towards technology transitions only. And that of course is the best way to achieve the ROI on those investments.","Mark Newman","So, does that mean slower technology migration or does it perhaps mean slightly lower utilization for temporary period?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, Mark, I'm not going to get into the specifics. Most important thing is, we have managed our CapEx lower and we continue to take actions to manage our production output lower to align our supply with our demand expectations. And I think the effect of these actions will in fact -- some of these actions will start showing as early as this quarter.","David Zinsner","And if you look at--","Mark Newman","Thanks Sanjay and then--","David Zinsner","Go ahead. Sorry Mark.","Mark Newman","I'm sorry, you go ahead Dave.","David Zinsner","I was just going to say, if you look at our gross margin, it would reflect that we have a very good cost structure for our products.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And the reduction of these outputs that we are talking about, our cost structure will remain in very good shape even with that. And in fact, in terms of cost, on a year-over-year basis, we actually, our cost reductions we believe both in DRAM and NAND will be above the industry. Cost reductions remain above the industry, yes.","Mark Newman","My follow-up question is on the demand. You talked about this a little bit of inventory correction amongst customers; some of your competitors have talked a bit about that as well. But you seem to be reasonably confident that demand is going to come back second half of calendar 2019, which also suggests that the inventory should have been burnt up by then. The customer's inventory should have been used up mostly by then.","It would just be helpful, do you have any data points to explain how you get that confidence that demand will come back? Is it perhaps on the NAND side more about demand elasticity? Is it on the DRAM side? Anything about the kind of magnitude of the inventory level the customers have to pay to give us some kind of sense that -- confidence that would've been used up within a couple of quarters for example that'll be great -- that would be very helpful. Thanks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, first of all, I think we should realize that the end market demand trends, by and large, really remain quite healthy and our customers also are absolutely continuing to show to us the optimism around the long-term demand trends.","And as we noted in my remarks, that in our fiscal second quarter, the bits for DRAM -- let me first talk about DRAM here, the bits for DRAM will be down on a year-over-year basis and this needs to be compared with the long-term DRAM demand CAGR of 20%, high teens to 20% range.","So, then in FQ2, on a year-over-year basis, you reduction and you contrast it with the long-term demand trends of 20% kind of demand growth, then it tells you that during fiscal second quarter, a lot of the inventory adjustments will certainly be occurring. And that's why we say that it will take couple of quarters for inventory adjustments to occur.","So, again, the point about year-over-year reduction in our DRAM shipments is an important point in understanding that the inventory adjustment by our customers is well underway. And all of this while the end market demand drivers of cloud, as you see from all the data, is absolutely continuing to be healthy. The end market demand driver in terms of average capacity increases of flash and smartphones as well as DRAM content and smartphones driven by AI and machine learning continues to be on the upward trend.","And of course, applications like automotive and industrial IoT with more AI and more machine learning all of these are continuing to drive the demand trends towards need for more storage and more memory.","And we laid out some of these opportunities at our Investor Day and all of those opportunities very much stay intact and at the end market level continue to be vibrant. So, I think these couple of points that the November quarter itself was in terms of overall shipment was below seasonal as well as the first quarter on a year-over-year basis really showing reduction points to inventory adjustments are well underway.","And of course, you have to look at this in the backdrop that the output in the industry is coming down as well. We have announced our decisive actions here today and we have provided the outlook in terms of our output growth in calendar year 2019, both for NAND as well as DRAM.","So, these -- and then, as I said before, that second half of the year tends to be a seasonally stronger part in terms of demand compared to the first half. So, these all are definitely pointing to our confidence, and built up on inputs from our customers in terms of second half of the year being stronger than the first half of the year in terms of -- in demand trends and the industry fundamentals as well.","And let me just point out one more thing here that, when you look at industry, I mean, compared to the past cycles, really the CapEx cuts are happening at much, much earlier level in the cycle and really, in terms of happening even at much higher levels of profitability than ever in the past. So, all this, overall, I believe, bodes well for the long term fundamentals of the industry as well as certainly for Micron.","Mark Newman","All right. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering if I could build on that last comment, you've talked a lot about your own plans in terms of curtailing your capacity expansion this year. But given that you are in off quarter, off calendar quarter, I'm just curious of how you will characterize maybe the competitive landscape? Maybe what you've seen change over the last month and a half or so relative to some of your competitors in the context of both DRAM and NAND? And I have a follow-up.","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think in that regard, you know as much as I do and over the course of last couple of months, there have been a reduction that have been discussed in the industry, the reductions that you have heard about that manufacturers have talked about, but also, several analysts have indicated those as well.","And of course, the near-term outlook has also as we said, continued to weaken through the course of our FQ1 timeframe and even since our FQ2 has started, those demand weakening trends have continued as well.","So, I think this is the information that is out there, is what we're using, but we can only talk about ourselves and we can -- we certainly have taken here decisive actions in terms of managing our output growth in line with our demand expectations.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, just thinking about your product portfolio, particularly, around the enterprise SSD market, I'm curious, it sounds like possibly you're seeing maybe even a quicker ramp towards NVMe than what you previously have seen. I mean is there a way to kind of quantify how much of maybe the enterprise SSD market is kind of moving away from you? And so you get your products into the market in the latter part of this calendar year -- or calendar year 2019?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Certainly, as we have been speaking for a while, the transition from SATA to NVMe is taking place at a fast pace, in enterprise, as well as in cloud applications. And we have been focused on developing our own products. And that's why, we have said that in calendar year -- our fiscal year 2019, as we bring out our new NVMe products to the market, our 2019 calendar year ends up being more a year of transition for us. But there is no question that the market certainly is moving from SATA to NVMe applications across the Board.","And we have just introduced some of our early NVMe products for consumer SSDs and I talked about how we have introduced NVMe product for automotive, applications as well. And during the course of calendar 2019, we'll first be bringing out client NVMe products to the market and then later in the year, we'll bring enterprise and cloud NVMe SSDs. And that's why, we look at calendar year 2020 will be the one timeframe, when we start gaining share again in our SSDs -- SSD market.","Aaron Rakers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Romit Shah","Yes. Thank you. Sanjay, I heard you indicate that you expect above average cost declines, but I guess my question is, aren't the actions that you've announced today probably more of a hit to cost per bit in 2020 versus 2019? How do we think about that?","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think what we have shown you today is that we are able to take decisive actions and we are able to take them fast. I mean, just remember that FQ4 was a record year for the company and FQ1, is when we first saw signs of inventory adjustment.","During the course of FQ1, we have been able to react in terms of cutting down our CapEx as well as manage our output growth. So, point is we can react fast to the changes that are needed in the marketplace and we remain -- this is something we review very, very closely on an ongoing basis, very focused on making sure that we are maximizing the long term profitability and long-term growth opportunity for Micron.","So, this is something that in terms of cost, we feel very good about our position for 2019 and beyond -- going beyond that. We of course continue to make very good progress on our technology nodes.","As I discussed with you, our technology on 1Z is progressing well. We feel good about that roadmap and continue to make good progress on our NAND roadmap as well. And that will all position us well for 2019 as well as for 2020 timeframe.","And I just want to point out that our focus also is on shifting our portfolio to high-value solutions and those will also strengthen our profitability profile.","Romit Shah","I guess as my follow-up on CapEx, I mean, you are cutting your forecast for the year, but CapEx is still up on a year-on-year basis. I'm curious if this downturn ends up being longer than any of us sort of anticipate? Is there a leverage to reduce CapEx any further from its current levels?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, I will just touch on CapEx, on your previous question on your cost, I also wanted to point out that on the cost side, we are making tremendous progress on the back-end assembly and test cost reductions as well as managing, transforming our supply chain operations, which will give us significant cost benefits as well.","So, all-in all, 2019 and beyond, feel very good about our technology roadmap, manufacturing roadmap, capability as well as overall cost capabilities. In terms of, on the CapEx side, just keep in mind, that we have said that with the adjustments that we just have made, over wafer equipment CapEx actually is coming down in fiscal year 2019 versus fiscal year 2018.","And as we've discussed before, Micron over the last few years have significantly underinvested in clean room shell CapEx in the facilities and the buildings that are needed to really implement ongoing future technology transition and big part of our CapEx as we have shared with you the past, actually is going towards buildings and facilities, clean room that will be needed for future technology transitions as well. All of that CapEx does not contribute to bit growth.","And similarly, we have significant increase in our CapEx in fiscal year 2019 over fiscal year 2018 on back-end test and assembly operations as well. And that is again intended to reduce costs, and not -- it doesn't go towards any bit growth.","And we have flexibility, as we have shown already, in terms of managing CapEx. We will continue to look at this carefully and if any factors require us to change our CapEx outlook again, we will absolutely address it in a timely and prudent fashion.","We always continue to evaluate market environment as well as our own status of technology, transitions, production requirements, and we are making real-time adjustments as needed.","Romit Shah","I mean it seems like the actions you guys are taking are very prudent, but I -- the part that's confusing for me is if you're slowing your process migration, then there should be some impact to cost per bit. And I'm just, I guess I'm just not quite -- I just don't quite understand what that impact is?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Again, in terms of cost per bit, there are a lot of details that have to be looked at. We're not going to get into all of those details here. Key message here is that we are bringing our production output in line with our demand expectations.","Second, we feel very good about our technology position and our cost position, and will continue to do very well in this regard. Cost position, of course, includes wafer level, die cost position but also, includes the benefits of assembly and test cost improvements that we are making.","And third, as we absolutely stay focused on our high-value solutions strategy, and we're executing well in the area, we talked about how in mobile, even in a market environment of significant NAND oversupply, we actually have delivered strong gains in our mobile high-value solutions portfolio as well.","Romit Shah","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day."],"15661":["Micron Technology, Inc.

Mark?","D Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. For our fiscal Q3 2015 Micron posted total revenue of $3.9 billion, within our revenue guidance of $3.8 billion to $4.05 billion. Revenue was sequentially lower as expected in fiscal Q3 due to near-term market headwinds, driven primarily by weakness in the PC sector. Net income was $491 million and earnings per share were $0.42. Non-GAAP net income was $620 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.54. Free cash flow was approximately $600 million, based upon operating cash flow and capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and $730 million respectively.","The team executed well in the challenging market conditions during Q3 as we supported our customers across a broad range of market segments. Micron is a memory company that produces technologically advanced components, systems and subsystems for the global marketplace. As such it\u2019s important that regardless of near-term market conditions we remain focused on the long-term. We are continuing to deploy advanced process technology to enable leading edge products for our customers and to drive ongoing manufacturing efficiency for Micron. ","Our customers are looking for a partner in memory system development who is capable of delivering advanced technology systems and solutions that are tuned to their product requirements and who will provide their products and their companies with a leading edge position in the marketplace. Today\u2019s customers are also looking for ways to gain more innovation and efficiency in their own system design as memory has been deployed in more ways than ever previously imagined. From cloud servers to mobile infrastructure and automotive design to industrial and medical devices Micron memory is a preferred memory partner and is at the heart of technology product innovation.","Turning to overall market conditions, we expect stabilizing DRAM ASPs across the broader market overtime, as we manage our product mix and distribute our capacity to a broad set of value added market segments. Consistent with prior expectations we are forecasting DRAM industry supply bit growth in the mid-20s in calendar 2015 and in the low to mid 20% in calendar 2016. We currently believe that DRAM demand in calendar 2015 in aggregate will be at or exceed supply.","For NAND the market continues to consume planer NAND at increasing rates and we look forward to volume production of Micron\u2019s differentiated high performance 3D NAND later this year. We expect NAND industry supply bit growth in the high 30% range this year and in the mid 30% range next year. We believe supply and demand are in balance this year and unconstrained demand is above supply in future periods based on currently known capacity plans.","We are making good progress with fab expansion in Singapore. We expect the market will demand all of the 3D NAND output we can produce given the attractive cost and performance of our technology and the elastic storage market we will sell into. Advanced technology deployment requires focused investment and carefully managed transitions. To effectively execute next generation technology production at scale we are converting tools and systems today to allow for testing, samples and product qualification in the future. These activities drive future growth and margin expansion opportunities in our business, although they often limit short-term bit growth and cost reductions.","We are continuing to make capital investments today to position ourselves for next generation production capabilities and for technology leadership. As always we will manage our capital to deliver long-term returns and shareholder value. ","For today\u2019s call I have asked Mark Adams to summarize our operational and BU results. I would also like to welcome Ernie Maddock, our recently appointed CFO. Ernie possesses outstanding industry experience, has hit the ground running and we are exciting to have him on the team. He will cover Q3 financials and Q4 guidance. I will return at the end of the prepared remarks with a quick summary and lead in the Q&A.","Mark Adams","Thank you, Mark. I will begin by providing an update on our key technology development initiatives, then review our DRAM and NAND businesses and conclude my portion of the call with commentary on each of our four business units.","On the technology deployment front we remained focused on three major technology initiatives, completing the ramp up of our 25 nanometer DRAM technology, driving scale output of our 20 nanometer DRAM technology and the launching of our 3D NAND technology. We are currently shipping early production in 20 nanometer DRAM and will continue to ramp throughout the remainder of this year. We are expecting bit crossover in the first half of calendar 2016. We are still on track for low volume production 3D NAND in the second half of 2015, ramping to a significant percentage of our trade NAND supply in calendar 2016. ","Now let me discuss our DRAM and NAND businesses. Let's begin with our DRAM business, which represents roughly 61% of our total revenue in fiscal Q3. We delivered DRAM solutions to a variety of market segments. While PC builds declined well below seasonally slow demand in the first half of the year, we saw relative stability in other end markets and responded to these conditions by adjusting our production mix throughout the quarter. ","As a percent of DRAM revenue in fiscal Q3, mobile within the high 20% range, the PC segment was in the low 30% range, the server business was in the low 20% range and networking, graphics and AIMM comprised the remainder. We continue to move production from DDR3 to DDR4 to meet growing customer demand across our customer base for long-term more stable business. ","Moving on to our NAND business; trade NAND revenue represented 32% of total revenue in fiscal Q3 and performance was consistent with our expectations. Our trade NAND bit growth was approximately flat due to mix shifts in favor of longer term design win opportunities for both Micron managed NAND and MCPs for Mobile and SSDs for our storage business. These products represent strong growth opportunities for us going forward. ","As a percent of trade NAND revenue in fiscal Q3, consumer, which includes cards, USB and components, was in the mid-40% range. Mobile, including MCPs was in the low 20% range; SSDs were in the high teens. AIMM and other embedded markets combined are roughly mid-teens. We saw a 3% uptick in NAND component pricing in the quarter as we move more bits to our own SSD and mobile business and reduce the supply available to the transactional channel market. ","We continue to better position our MLC portfolio to focus on strategic customers in higher performance segments. In fiscal Q3, these efforts reduced our MLC shipments into the existing TLC-enabled components channel by approximately 30%. ","Moving onto our business units; CNBU, for our Computing and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.5 billion in fiscal Q3 with operating income of $266 million. CNBU is impacted by lower ASPs driven by softness in demand from the PC segment. Consistent with our statements on the last earnings call we have reduced output targeted at the PC segments in favor of faster growing more stable segments. We expect better relative performance for PC builds in the second half of calendar year 2015 along with continued DRAM content growth, resulting in PC DRAM bit demands up slightly for the year. ","CNBU enterprise customers continued their transition to DDR4 technology, including 8 gigabit DDR4 to support workloads that require both higher performance and higher density models. We continue to believe that applications such as in-memory database computing will drive substantial growth. ","In the networking segment we see continued LTE deployments in emerging markets, which should represent additional opportunities as we move forward. Cloud server represents a high growth segment with analysts projecting 50% bit growth year-over-year. Growth in our graphics business was driven by sales in the game consoles and high performance graphics cards. This segment is transitioning to GDDR5. ","We also commenced shipments of our first 20 nanometer graphics products. I mentioned our commencing 20 nanometers shipments earlier in my script. These initial products are primarily in support of CNBU, for example our compute customer in the PC segments. ","Revenues in Micron\u2019s storage business unit was $901 million in fiscal Q3, down 6% sequentially as we opportunistically shifted more NAND bits to higher margin businesses such as our mobile and embedded business units. Gross margins were up slightly in the quarter as we continue to focus on improving our storage business. Operating margins were slightly negative as we remained focused on investing for sustainable growth in this area. ","Consistent with our stated strategy to improve Micron\u2019s storage business we made good progress on key milestones in our third quarter. We announced availability of our new 16 nanometer TLC planer NAND components in fiscal Q3 and already have several channel customers buying our TLC, who will input them into SSDs, consumer drives, memory cards and other products, offering high density storage product to market based on this technology.","Our SBU enterprise and data center businesses both grew 45% sequentially albeit from a lower base. We are pleased with the progress of our collaboration with Seagate and we will have our first SaaS SSD launch resulting from this partnership later in the summer. We have begun early sampling with customers and already have secured two qualification slots with major OEMs. And finally we released our own consumer SSD based on TLC NAND technology in the second half of 2015. We expect to have roughly 50% of our SDDs on TLC by the end of fiscal year 2016.","Revenue in MBU, Mobile Business Unit was $938 million in fiscal Q3, up 10% sequentially. Operating income was $296 million or 32%, up from 31% in fiscal Q2. The mobile market supply demand balance remains healthy. Our mobile business continues to benefit from increasing content growth across the entire range of mobile products. 3 to 4 gigabyte phones announced at Mobile World Congress in March are now hitting the market. Low to mid-priced phones targeted at emerging markets are being built with significant memory content, including DRAM specs at 1 gigabyte and above. ","We are also seeing a pull-in of next generation 4G LTE chipsets in reference designs that double the content of both DRAM and NAND from 2 gigabytes to 4 gigabytes of DRAM and from 8 and 16 gigabytes NAND to 16 and 32 gigabyte configurations. Micron continues joint validations for low power DDR4 across chipset platforms. LP4 adoption is currently limited to the very high end of the markets today but will be adopted more broadly in calendar 2016.","Additionally the rapid adoption of eMCPs in the high growth mid-range market creates a significant opportunity for Micron as eMCPs will drive [ph] both low power DRAM and NAND, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio. ","Micron\u2019s embedded business unit posted revenues of $483 million with operating margins of 20%. Sales of our automotive-grade eMMC hit all-time high. We introduced our auto grade low power DDR4 in high performance G18 parallel NOR Flash devices in fiscal Q3. These products enable improved performance and power reduction for critical applications in high temperature rugged environments. EBU also experienced strong demand in the gaming business. Demand for high density 45 nanometer NOR Flash solutions are being driven by regulatory change in the Japanese gaming sector and we expect this elevated level of demand to continue.","It\u2019s also worthy to note that EBU shipments of NAND increased 27% from the prior quarter. Now to continue our commentary on fiscal Q3 results and Q4 guidance I will turn the call over to Ernie.","Ernie Maddock","Thanks Mark. It\u2019s a pleasure to be joining the Micron team and I look forward to meeting many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day in August. The third quarter of fiscal 2015 ended on June 4th and the results include net income of $491 million or $0.42 per share on net sales of $3.9 billion and gross margin of 31%. Aside from our recurring items non-GAAP adjustments include an additional provision for income taxes relating to a tax rate change in Japan that resulted in a reduction in the value of the deferred tax asset from MMJ operations. So non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $620 million or $0.54 a share.","Let\u2019s turn to results by product line starting with DRAM; DRAM revenue decreased approximately 13% compared to the second quarter, reflecting approximately a 10% decrease in per bit average selling prices and relatively flat sales volumes. DRAM gross margin was in the upper 30s range as cost per bit decreased approximately 6%. As was previously noted we adjusted our output mix during the quarter and excited with relatively flat DRAM inventory levels. ","On the trade NAND side which includes our growing MCP business, revenue increased approximately 3% in the third quarter with average selling prices increasing approximately 6%, partially offset by a slight decrease in sales volume. The increase in the trade NAND average selling price was mix related as higher ASP units grew relatively faster than the overall average. Trade NAND gross margin improved slightly compared to the prior quarter and was in the low 20% range as the increase in mix related ASP exceeded the higher related cost. ","The company generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion during the third quarter and ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and marketable investments. During the third quarter we received $1 billion in proceeds from the issuance of high yield notes and we deployed $782 million to repurchase a portion of the outstanding series C and D convertible notes. Cash expenditures for property plans and equipment during the first three quarters were $2.3 billion and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be within our previously forecasted FY '15 range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion. ","SG&A expense for the quarter was below our guided range as a result of lower legal cost while research and development expense was above our guided range primarily due to higher volumes of wafers used for development of new products and technologies. ","Now looking to guidance for the fourth quarter; DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter should be down mid-single digits compared to the third quarter based on bit production flat to slightly up while average selling prices are going -- will be down mid to high-single digits and cost per bit up low-single digits. Key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the fourth quarter include the continued effects of higher mix of mobile and DDR4 products, which have larger die sizes and therefore produce fewer bits per wafer. ","Fiscal Q4 quarter-to-date mix adjusted ASP is below the third quarter average, due primarily to reductions in PC-DRAM and cloud server ASPs. Pricing in mobile and specialty DRAM remains relatively stable. We have and will continue to carefully balance output volumes between our end markets. The trade NAND gross margins for the fourth quarter using quarter-to-date average ASP and projected mix for the quarter are expected to be flat compared to the third quarter, based on bit production down low to mid-single digits while ASPs are relatively stable and cost per bit is approximately flat. ","Key trends for the fourth quarter affecting this guidance are, like-for-like pricing down slightly offset by average selling price improvements on changes in mix and continued focus on mobile and managed NAND products. These products generally have both higher ASPs and cost. On a consolidated basis we are guiding total revenue for the fourth quarter in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.7 billion. ","Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, SG&A spending in the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $180 million with research and development expense in the range of $400 million. For non-GAAP guidance for fourth quarter please refer to the dilution table posted along with other materials for this call on our website. The dilution table reflects the anti-dilutive effects of our cap calls at various stock prices. ","Now I'll turn it back over to Mark Durcan.","D Mark Durcan","Thanks Ernie. In summary I believe Micron executed well in fiscal Q3 as we supported our customers across a broad range of market segments. We expect to continue to similarly navigate changing market conditions in fiscal Q4. Micron is executing on key milestones in technology deployment and product introductions we believe strongly in the future of the industry and our company. ","Operator I think we're ready to begin Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. DRAM revenue bit shipments were down slightly quarter-on-quarter. Can you just tell us what your bit production growth was? I think you said you didn't build any inventory. Also I think you previously talked about high-single digits production shipment growth over the next couple of quarters, but the main quarter results and the August quarter guidance certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be suggesting this. So is the Micron team still targeting bit shipment growth in the mid-teens range this year? ","D Mark Durcan","This is Mark Durcan. Maybe I'll start with the last part of that question and then Mark Adams can comment a little bit on the mix effects and what happened with DRAM sales bit. So for 2015 I think it's still fair to say that had we not had mix adjustments as we move through the year we would still be driving to a high teens number for DRAM bit growth. But obviously the number for the year is now going to be less than that given the changes we made as we moved through the year. As we think forward over the longer term and clearly we said in the past and we continue to reiterate that we will be higher than market as we move through calendar 2016. ","On the NAND front, we've been less than market in 2015 and we're still evaluating exactly what our capital plans look like for 2016 and we'll dial those based on market conditions as well as ongoing evaluation of the technology introductions in Singapore relative to the 3D NAND and deployment of other advanced technologies there. ","Mark if you want to take the DRAM sales bit and the mix effect that drove that, maybe that's the best approach. ","Mark Adams","Sure, we\u2019ve said all along that we will obviously take in the market dynamics into play as we think about how we allocate our capacity, and given some of the headwinds in the PC market we re-directed some of that capacity to either more strategic long-term markets such as the DDR4, and then some of the PC new bits just to more attractive long-term stable markets. A good example of that would be cloud servers, another example would be our mobile business. And we think that was the right thing to do but they do have a lowering effect on the bit growth. ","Harlan Sur","Okay, great. And then just my follow up question on the NAND front. So I think team is starting to make the move to 16 nanometer TLC, you are driving some production of 3D, obviously that will be a bigger part of the mix in the second half of this year and next year. But the team is still looking for decline in production growth in the August quarter. What's your sense on when we should expect bit production to start to inflect higher for your NAND business? ","D Mark Durcan","Well, again that's going to depend on the details of the mix decisions we make. What's been going on here over the last quarter or two is that as we transition to higher percent of SSD sales we build width. And so the time the product takes through the line increases and that creates a dip over a confined period of time as we build out width. Mobile is a similar type of effect as some of that output goes out in MCPs as well. So I think that the larger question is exactly when will we see NAND bit growth? I think you will see that emerge as we move through the next number of quarters. ","Harlan Sur","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. ","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you. Mark you mentioned that for this year your expectation is that DRAM demand will exceed supply, but ASPs year-to-date in DRAM are clearly worse than expectations. How do we reconcile that? ","D Mark Durcan","Yeah, what I tried to indicate is that I think in aggregate for the year the demand is going to exceed the supply, which I think your takeaway from that would be that we believe that demand is going to be higher in the back half of the year as we said on the last call, and as we continue to believe. And so that as we cume that up over the entire year you will come to the conclusion that the growth that we continue to see in some of the other markets, mobile, datacenter, enterprise server et cetera, and networking will offset what's been a slow PC period. ","Even PCs I think, our view is that by the time we get to the end of the year notwithstanding the decrease in unit sales, there will be a small net growth in bits into the PC segment. ","Romit Shah","I guess what I'm alluding to is that if you look at the ASP trend over the last few periods and your DRAM bit growth relative to peers, I'm just curious to what extent do you believe that the industry is still being rational. ","D Mark Durcan","Well, I think it's fair to say that probably nobody expected the PC segment to be as slow as it\u2019s been. And I think it\u2019s also reasonable to expect that in an industry with a number of high growth segments balancing supply and demand is never going to be precise. And so ripples in the relative balance of supply and demand I believe are inevitable in a market like this and what I would say is that probably supply got a little bit further ahead of demand than many of us anticipated but that it\u2019s not necessarily an indicator of a deliberate strategy by any particular player in the marketplace.","Romit Shah","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to a prior question. In that context when we go back to when industry consolidated we all expected that mobile and servers are going to be more of a secular growth driver and these two segments obviously carry a [die penalty] [ph]. Given the consolidated industry why is that industry more proactively seeking higher margin. If there is a mix issue in the near-term, it seems to me that these headwinds are more structural since the demand drivers are actually in the mobile and server. So wonder if you can help us better understand how the industry is going to overcome this, especially as migration to sub 20 nanometer is going to be relatively more challenging and lengthier and in that context how are you going to be able to manage margins? And I have a follow-up.","D Mark Durcan","I think the answer to that question is that in an undersupplied market, as we had a number of quarters ago, you tend to get margins that are higher in maybe the least attractive long-term part of the market. And so if you think about where PC margins were, they were higher than we were experiencing in both mobile and in server, primarily because suppliers view those as long-term least attractive and a market that was maybe less sustainable. And therefore you see larger price swings as the relative supply and demand balance moves over time.","Now as you think about what does that imply, that implies that as companies like Micron and presumably our competitors over time readjust their supply to rebalance demand in different segments and pull supply out of that sector it creates an ASP headwind for us because we are moving to products that already have lower margin and it creates over the short-term more intense competition for those sockets in the high growth sectors. That doesn\u2019t say anything really about what will happen over the longer time horizon.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay, and I am still not sure how are you going to be able to recoup these near-term margin headwind, is that as is more of a scaling and I am still confused, how the near-term margin pressure is going to -- you are going to be able to overcome it and be able to better manage margins?","D Mark Durcan","Well, I think I believe overtime that there is -- in some of these other market segments there is opportunity to differentiate and to innovate and to provide stickier solutions. There is also a higher growth and longer qualification cycle. So what a company like Micron does is they look at -- and I think Mark kind of already alluded to this but I will restate it anyway, we\u2019re looking to place our product, not necessarily in the short-term to pick up the highest margin point but to make sure we are placing our product where we're going to have growth and stability and where overtime we can drive higher margins. And so sometimes you want to be a little bit proactive and out front of that. ","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it, and then quickly on NAND. Right now your trends are to build the pilot line, this 3D NAND pilot line in Singapore and then, what -- 48 layer that samples are coming out. And then my impression is that you're going to add production capacity in Singapore. But your FLASH partner Intel is also very upbeat about the 3D NAND and technology and how they're also going to use that technology. So when we look into next year and beyond, how is this relationship going to work, because the JVs are in -- the JV fabs are located in U.S. but you're initially going to ramp the capacity in Singapore. How will this -- how will the transaction going to play out and when would you actually finish adding capacities in the JV locations? ","D Mark Durcan","So let me correct a couple of things you said, just to make sure we are clear on what we're doing and then I'll -- maybe have a couple of comments on the Intel relationship. But I think that\u2019s something that's better done by two of us as opposed to just Micron. ","So first of all, relative to what we are doing today, we have as you know a significant installed planar base in Singapore. We have available clean room space there to begin the process of converting some of that planar capacity to 3D NAND, and we're under construction of an expansion in that facility so that we can continue that transition of planar NAND to 3D NAND into the back half of 2016 and on beyond that. ","There is also capacity that Micron and Intel own jointly in Lehi, Utah and today you're correct that is all planar NAND capacity. So one other thing, I think you said 48 layers. We are currently sampling a 32 layer 3D NAND device and that is the device that we will initially ramp before moving to a second generation of 3D device starting in the back half of 2016. ","Now relative to Micron's and Intel's plans for production, there is not a whole lot I can say about that today, other than to say it continues to be a very close partnership. We continue to develop the 3D NAND technology together and we have existing long-term supply agreements with Intel to support planar NAND and we anticipate that we will build 3D NAND for them as well through an agreement out of Singapore. And that's probably all I can say, absent an agreement with Intel to share more information with you. ","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. Thanks so very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.","Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my question. On the transition or moving your capacity away from PC-DRAM towards more strategic DRAM, where are you with that? Have you stopped the transition and what percentage do you think the split will be in the August quarter and going into the November quarter?","D Mark Durcan","Well I\u2019m going to stop short of giving you accurate actual numbers on allocation of our capacity for variety of reasons. But I will tell you that the process is in place. You can see some of the growth we've had in certain sectors as we reported that. And so it's in process. Mobile, overall growth rate from a segment demand standpoint is up 50% and PC bits are low-single digits, 5% range. So as we think about that shift we are making it has to respond to that. And we're on that path. As we said we started in Q3 and we'll continue to balance that out as the market warrant. ","Kevin Cassidy","And maybe just as a follow-up, the visibility you have into mobile and there is some concern in the market that you could overshoot and end up with too much capacity in mobile. Can you talk more about some of your visibility into the mobile market?","D Mark Durcan","So I think we talked a few things. As I mentioned in my script we've actually seen continued growth in content per device. We see that while some people have noticed that the China market starting to mature somewhat, we are starting to see more growth out of India and emerging markets. So in general our visibility is pretty good with the level of configurations, both in the mid-range smartphone market. I think those unit growth -- there is something around 90% unit growth for the year and the bit growth rate. So our visibility supports the moving -- as our capacity covers that and I think the results of our MBU further reinforces that.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir from Ladenburg.","Daniel Amir","Thanks a lot. So if we look at the Inotera deal from seven-eight months ago, when you talked about it, you commented that at that time, if pricing would be the same would be significantly accretive. How would we look at the deal right now in terms of the pricing at the moment and do you think something is going to change there in the next six months? Thanks.","D Mark Durcan","Obviously at lower pricing the accretion from the new deal, which will begin in the beginning of calendar 2016 will be less than it would have been had pricing been flat. We never assumed pricing would be flat throughout 2016. So I think the net takeaway is that there is less accretion from the new deal than there was on the day we signed it. It\u2019s still reasonable to talk in terms of the types of numbers that we talked about when we first introduced the new agreement to you.","Daniel Amir","So it\u2019s still accretive at pricing that we are looking at today or is that not the case?","D Mark Durcan","Absolutely true, yes.","Daniel Amir","Okay. All right and just a follow-up here in terms of the factors here for your NAND cost going forward, I mean should we view really, is it really the TLC mix, is it more of the product mix, I mean what should we be looking at and when you said that you should start seeing in the next few quarters what are really the milestones that we are looking at, that this will really start impacting?","Mark Adams","I think at the risk of repeating our story on NAND, I think that we\u2019ve already demonstrated substantial growth in the mobile NAND segment and our TLC component shipping in Q3 will be the catalyst for our future growth there. As a follow on we have a consumer TLC drive coming out in the Q1 of our fiscal year. And so when you look at those dynamics coupled with the vertical NAND enterprise progress we are making, we feel that those are still the pillars to our success in improving our operating performance in the overall NAND business.","Daniel Amir","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark you were talking about like move from PC DRAM to mobile DRAM has been headwind to the margins. So are the margins now similar in PC DRAM and mobile DRAM or is the move still a headwind?","Mark Adams","Sure. Hey Monika, this is Mark Adams. The margins are getting closer and we always run the risk of trying to explain that through the past 90 days and what\u2019s happened [ph]. At the beginning of the quarter they were certainly further away from each other and today they are approaching each other.","Monika Garg","Okay, thanks. Then one question on the NAND side, the SBU operating margins be negative for this quarter and last quarter. You have talked about move to TLC and you also talked about that pricing is benign in the market. So when can we see SBU margins to move higher in the positive territory?","D Mark Durcan","Well I think you will see that overtime, Monika but don\u2019t forget our NAND business is actually segregated across the Bus. So we sell NAND not only through the SBU but there is a significant piece as Mark Adams just mentioned going out of mobile space. We also said there is significant growth in the embedded space for NAND, and then there is a sort of a counter factor, I guess that you should always be cognizant of, that we sell to Intel through the NAND BU and sometimes that\u2019s -- there are lots of facets to our relationship with Intel that have benefits to us, that aren\u2019t always about selling to them at the highest ASP.","Monika Garg","Got it, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company. ","Timothy Arcuri ","Thanks so much. I also have two questions. First of all, did you say costs are being guided up low singles? And I get the mix issues that you cited with mobile and DDR4. But it still seems a little odd given that Inotera\u2019s roughly one-third of the bits and that\u2019s still based on market minus [ph]. So is there something behind the scene happening with costs and then I had a follow-up thanks?","Mark Adams","The real answer to that is there\u2019s nothing behind the scenes other than what normally happens in our industry on startup. And you've got some parallel startup tasks that are influencing cost along with the mix effect that you mentioned in mobile. But you've got DDR4 ramp cost and in parallel you got 20 nanometer startup cost that when blended are providing a little bit of a cost headwind in the short term. ","Timothy Arcuri ","Okay, thanks. And then just a quick question on CapEx. To hit your full $3.8 billion midpoint the CapEx has to be like 1.5, 1.6 just in August which would be like a $6 billion annual run rate heading in fiscal 2016. How should we think about that? Is that like an anomaly in August or should we think about that as being close to what the right run-rate is as you look into fiscal 2016?","Ernie Maddock","Tim, this is Ernie. We, as we've said earlier we've been looking at CapEx very carefully as we respond to market conditions and obviously we still feel that range of -- in the $4 billion or so range for this year makes sense. I wouldn't necessarily imply or project that forward as a run-rate into 2016. We're still in the process of working through our plans. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore ISI. ","CJ Muse","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question I was hoping you could dig a little bit deeper on the 20 nanometer ramp, both at Inotera and internally. And you're really focused on when you expect to be cost competitive with Samsung and Hynix. And then as a follow on to that your plans for 1X and your ability to reduce Samsung's time to market advantage, would love to hear your thoughts. ","D Mark Durcan","Yeah, so first of all, I think the best way to characterize the state of our 20 nanometer deployment today is we're running at relatively low volumes, but it's going really very, very well. We're -- we've got low volume but we're driving fast cycle time through the fab. The run head [ph] lots and the yields are progressing fabulously. And we feel pretty good about the way that ramp\u2019s going both at Inotera and in Hiroshima. So of course as we just said the costs are higher. It takes a while to work through that now because you're driving [indiscernible] up but also because at low volume you don't have fully loaded tools and you have a lot of tools that you're installing and you haven\u2019t managed the load yet. And that process is going to take a while, until we are really driving through significant volume. ","Now the way to think about that is in terms of bit crossover. And we think that we'll have bit crossover, 20 nanometer versus the other nodes in the first half of calendar 2016 and that's probably about as precise as I would want to be about that. ","Now for 1X, we think that as we closed the Elpida transaction we added significant technology development resources to our team. We've been running at a higher R&D spend as we ran more resources deployed on multiple technology nodes and the 1X node will be the first one that comes out as a result of both those teams working together. So yes, we expect to close that gap relative to Samsung. It's not going to necessarily be directly on top of it. ","But remember what Micron\u2019s doing right now is that we're converting a lot of capacity from 30 nanometer to 20 nanometer, which is a double step. And so we're going to get a big bang for that as we move throughout 2016. Step two, to 60 nanometer, smaller to begin with, in particular if you\u2019ve looked at some of the early Samsung samples that are floating around. You will notice that the architecture changes that they've incorporated don't drive nearly the size of die reduction or the bit density increase that you would see going from even 25 nanometer to 30. ","So we absolutely expect to close the gap with Samsung as we move to 16 nanometer, both in timing and in terms of overall deployed bit density in the market.","CJ Muse","That\u2019s very helpful. I guess as my follow-up can you talk about, within your outlook for DRAM pricing, down to mid to high single digits, what you are assuming on the mobile side and if you can comment at all on your positioning within tier 1 handsets into the back half of the year, would love to hear your thoughts?","D Mark Durcan","Again we don\u2019t want to -- we don\u2019t get into business of forecasting pricing too much. Generally what I would say characteristic of the mobile business is that it doesn\u2019t exactly behave like PC business. That tends to be more of a design win type business, you design into a device or platform that has long lasting life cycles relative to interchangeability of PC modules. And in light of that it behaves a little bit more like a predictable pricing model where there is a sale price and a cost reduction target over through a longer period, maybe six months, maybe 12 months. And so the pricing behavior in mobile is somewhat different and we anticipate that to be similar going forward and it\u2019s reflective of our current mobile performance.","CJ Muse","And so it\u2019s fair to characterize mobile declining less than PC?","D Mark Durcan","I think that\u2019s fair.","CJ Muse","Okay, great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer ","Yeah good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess I want to go back to the question that Tim Arcuri asked earlier just about DRAM cost per bit going up. I would have thought that given that third of your bits come from Inotera and that\u2019s based upon market pricing and arrears that the price declines we\u2019ve seen over the last three months would be a big sort of tailwind to cost for you guys in the August quarter, and I guess that\u2019s wrong. I guess I am trying to understand why that\u2019s wrong and more importantly as you think about the headwinds on the cost side in DRAM in the August quarter do they begin to reverse in the November quarter or how do we start to think about kind of the cost curve in DRAM going back down instead of up?","D Mark Durcan","Let me take the first part and then we will have you restate the second part. Relative to IMI bits we are early in the ramp. So there is not a lot of upsurge in IMI bits yet. But it is coming. And I think the effect will be, as you say with more volume at any given price we are going to get a larger dollar discount, not necessarily a larger percentage discount. So as we move through the rest of 2015 you do have to contemplate that the discount at IMI is also a function of their cash flow and that stands apart and aside from the effect of market pricing.","You also have to contemplate that at lower market pricing, a given fixed percent discount is a smaller dollar discount. So all those things kind of go in the hopper, John. I\u2019m not sure exactly how you are doing your calculus but those are all effects. ","We will, obviously as the 20 nanometer becomes a more significant piece of their output, hopefully see an increase in revenue and an increase in total dollar discount as that happens.","John Pitzer ","And Mark maybe just to restate the second half of the question was, beyond the August quarter if all else being equal given the ramps that are causing headwinds in the August quarter would you expect cost per bits in DRAM to start trending down or do we really have to wait until you get to that big crossover at 20 nanometer you had talked about earlier?","D Mark Durcan","I think it\u2019s going to depend a lot on mix. Unfortunately I hate to say that but we still got -- we\u2019ve got ongoing DDR4 which drives costs up given the bit density per square centimeter. So we\u2019ve got LPDDR4, we\u2019ve got mobile DRAM and server DRAM, all of which can drive higher costs, but like-for-like, fair to say yeah cost are going to be coming down, as we get a little bit further in those 20 nanometer transition.","John Pitzer ","And then for my second question, just to Mark Adams. Mark, just given some of these headwinds in the August quarter it seems like the P&L is more dependent upon just overall pricing and you made some commentary about PC production being below kind of seasonally weak sell through for the market and you expect that to reverse I am just kind of curious why what\u2019s the catalyst. And important can you talk a little bit about inventory outside of Micron relative to PC-DRAM. ","Mark Adams","Sure, let me -- the comments on the PC business were kind through our Q3 relative to the performance. We do feel that whether it be Microsoft Windows 10 or Skylight or other Intel roadmap benefits from PC and pent-up demand. We just think it should be moderately better than in the first half and that's had the better effect on the overall market than in the first half of the year. So we think PC should perform better in the second half. ","Relative to the DRAM side and the mix shifting away from PCs we think that combination leads to more stability in the pricing in the back half of the year. Now you asked about the channel, it's kind of initial dynamic [ph]. By and large the OEMs and major suppliers to OEM, there is one channel partner is heavily investing a lot of inventory. Having said that a number of [indiscernible] suppliers are pretty little -- actually seasonably lower than what we say the three to four week normal inventory levels. And so as these things improve and there is balance we don\u2019t think it takes a lot to get more bounce back into the compute segment and which should have a very positive effect in the overall business. ","John Pitzer ","Thank you. ","D Mark Durcan","And with that I think we have time for about one more question. ","Operator","Thank you and our final question for today comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research.","Steven Fox","Thanks, good afternoon. Hopefully this isn't too repetitive, but just going back on the DRAM gross margins from a different bit. I understand what you're saying about cost per bit with the mix changing. But also as the mix changes beyond the August quarter, shouldn't we expect some sort of rebound in DRAM margins and to what degree? And -- or are we looking at more of a drag from a 20 nanometer ramp? And then within that answer can you just maybe talk a little bit more about DDR4 and how it's going to ramp on the mobile side thanks. ","D Mark Durcan","So we really want to stay away again from predicting margins for you. But I think it's fair to say that assuming market dynamics improve we've got -- we've got, all else equal we've got cost leverage. ","Steven Fox","Fair enough. And how about just a little more color on DDR4 as it relates to mobile. ","D Mark Durcan","I think LPDDR4 -- I think as I said in my script it's currently a relatively a small percentage of overall bits into the mobile sector. We do see that changing out towards the end of calendar year '15 and into '16, today low power fours [ph] in the ultra-high end. At least what we -- obviously we're very well positioned in those relationships. It\u2019s just a small piece of the overall next today and we think that will grow and we got a technology and our in design qualifications at these OEMs for that type of success in that product category. ","Steven Fox","Great, thank you very much. ","D Mark Durcan","You bet and with that we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered solid fiscal third quarter results despite headwinds from industry oversupply and steeper-than-expected price declines. This financial performance reflects our continued strong execution on technology advancement, product cost reduction, and pricing discipline. Our healthy balance sheet, structurally improved profitability, and winning team set the foundation for us to emerge even stronger when the industry environment recovers.","We are confident that the long-term demand outlook for memory and storage is compelling, driven by broad secular trends such as AI, autonomous vehicles, 5G, and IoT. The new Micron is well positioned to take advantage of these trends, with innovative products, a responsive supply chain, and well-established relationships with customers worldwide. ","Over the last few months, customer inventory improvements have progressed largely in line with our expectations in most end markets. This reinforces our confidence that bit demand for DRAM will return to healthy year-over-year growth in the second half of calendar 2019. NAND bit demand is also increasing in most markets as elasticity kicks in, in response to price declines over the last year. Even as customer inventory levels of DRAM and NAND improve across most end markets, producer inventory levels are elevated.","Although previously announced CapEx cuts will start to impact industry supply in the second half of the calendar year, our assessment is that further cuts in CapEx and bit supply will be required to return the industry to a healthy supply-demand balance. I will discuss our actions on this front shortly, but first, let me provide an overview of our FQ3 results.","At our 2018 Analyst Day, we discussed our priorities related to technology, cost competitiveness, and high-value solutions. Solid execution on these strategies has now yielded over 2,000 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement relative to our peers since 2016. Unlike the last downturn during which Micron\u2019s relative profitability declined, in this downturn our relative profitability has continued to improve.","In DRAM, we are on track to deliver good cost declines in fiscal 2019. We continue to increase the mix of 1Y nanometer and are making excellent progress toward ramping 1Z next fiscal year. In April, we broke ground on our new cleanroom in Taichung, Taiwan, and earlier this month we announced the opening of a new cleanroom in Hiroshima, Japan. These cleanroom expansions will enable future DRAM node transitions of our existing wafer capacity.","In NAND, we continue to ramp our 96-layer 3D NAND and are on track to achieve healthy cost declines in fiscal 2019. We continue to make progress on our 128-layer 3D NAND, which uses replacement gate technology. As we discussed on the last call, we expect a partial transition to this node, with the full portfolio transition occurring on the second-generation replacement gate node.","In addition to these node transitions in DRAM and NAND, we are also improving our cost structure by increasing the percentage of products produced through captive back-end packaging facilities. These facilities now account for more than half of our total assembly requirements. Our captive back-end operations are tightly integrated with our front-end systems, enabling greater product customization, tighter quality control, improved responsiveness to shifts in demand, and lower costs.","High-value solutions now account for over two-thirds of NAND revenues. We made further progress in strengthening our SSD portfolio with the launch of our 9,300 data center NVMe SSDs for cloud and enterprise markets. We more than doubled revenue shipments of our new NVMe client SSD to large PC OEMs, and more customer qualifications are in progress. As a reminder, this new NVME drive is built with our own controller technology.","QLC SSD bit shipments increased approximately 75% sequentially, driven by growth of our consumer NVMe SSDs. Overall, the Micron team continues to execute well on cost reductions and on high-value solutions. While we are operating in a difficult industry environment today, our progress is visible in our reported profitability and increases our confidence in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value.","Now turning to highlights by end markets. Our mobile business was impacted by U.S. trade restrictions, which Dave and I will discuss later in the call. Looking ahead, innovations such as 5G, foldable phones, and advanced cameras will drive growth for our products. Our portfolio of Mobile DRAM products features best-in-class power consumption. On low-power DDR5, we are leading the industry and recently started sampling the highest-density die in the market.","We continue to make good progress on our managed NAND products as well, and recently launched our second-generation UFS product with best-in-class endurance. Within the data center market, cloud customers are turning the corner on inventories, and most are approaching normal inventory levels. Our cloud DRAM bit shipments grew sequentially in the fiscal third quarter, exceeding our expectations, and early trends suggest strong sequential growth for the FQ4.","Enterprise customer inventories are taking somewhat longer to normalize than we had previously expected. We continue to sample and secure qualifications on 64 gigabyte DDR4 server modules built with our 1Y nanometer DRAM. In graphics, we saw robust sequential growth as customer inventories normalized. We expanded our customer base for our high-performance GDDR6, which positions us well for strong growth in the second half of calendar 2019.","In the PC market, DRAM bit shipments returned to growth as CPU shortages started to improve. Looking ahead, we expect strong sequential DRAM bit growth in our fiscal fourth quarter as laptop sales improve. In automotive, while global auto sales are slow, content growth remains strong, driven by innovations in ADAS and infotainment systems.","Micron is well-positioned to benefit from the growth opportunity in this market given our leading market share, deep customer relationships, and high-quality products. We recently began ramping shipments with an industry-leading OEM for their most advanced autonomous system, which uses 16 gigabytes of our low-power DRAM.","Before talking about the market outlook, I want to provide some comments related to Huawei. As you know, effective May 16, the US Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, or \u201cBIS,\u201d added Huawei and 68 of its non-US affiliates to the BIS Entity List.","To ensure compliance, Micron immediately suspended shipments to Huawei and began a review of Micron products sold to Huawei to determine whether they are subject to the imposed restrictions. Through this review, we determined that we could lawfully resume shipping a subset of current products because they are not subject to Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions. We have started shipping some orders of those products to Huawei in the last two weeks.","However, there is considerable ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Huawei situation, and we are unable to predict the volumes or time periods over which we\u2019ll be able to ship products to Huawei. Micron will continue to comply with all government and legal requirements, just as we do in all our operations globally. Of course, we cannot predict whether additional government actions may further impact our ability to ship to Huawei.","Now turning to the market outlook for DRAM. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen early signs of bit demand recovery in most DRAM end markets. Based on our assessment of customer inventory improvement, we anticipate robust bit demand growth for the industry in the second half of the calendar year, compared to the weak demand in the first half. ","Our view of calendar 2019 industry DRAM bit demand growth is in the mid-teens, with industry supply growing mid-to-high teens. Despite the early signs of recovery in DRAM bit demand, the excess supply and resulting higher producer inventory levels have created a challenging pricing environment. We expect that the strengthening demand growth will begin to contribute to an improving trend in producer inventory later in calendar 2019.","Turning to our supply, at Micron our focus continues to be on taking prudent steps to help bring the DRAM market back to stabilization. We are continuing the previously announced wafer start reductions of approximately 5%, which we expect will bring our DRAM bit supply growth for calendar 2019 close to market demand growth. The overall NAND market remains oversupplied from the accelerated supply growth driven by the industry transition from 2D NAND production to 3D NAND.","Our NAND industry bit demand growth expectations for calendar 2019 are unchanged at the mid-30% range. We continue to target our bit shipments to be close to the industry demand growth rate. Since our last earnings call, we have taken actions to further adjust wafer starts from the previously announced 5% reduction to now approximately 10%, which will result in lower supply growth in the second half of the calendar year.","These reductions are the result of both capital optimizations to reuse more existing equipment for our 96-layer conversion, as well as lowering some of our legacy NAND capacity, which","we announced previously. While we still believe the NAND industry supply is growing above demand this year, the market is showing signs of increased elasticity stemming from recent price declines. ","We are optimistic that the overall NAND market will start to stabilize in the second half of calendar 2019. With the higher levels of macro uncertainty and the relatively high levels of inventory on our balance sheet, we are taking decisive action to manage our DRAM and NAND bit production. In addition to the wafer start reductions that we discussed we are also taking action on ","CapEx. Earlier this year, we announced a reduction in fiscal 2019 CapEx forecast from $10.5 billion plus or minus 5% at the start of the year, to approximately $9 billion now. For fiscal 2020, we plan for CapEx to be meaningfully lower than fiscal 2019. While our CapEx plans are still being finalized, we seek to balance our manufacturing investments with our free cash flow objectives.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Dave to provide financial results of our fiscal third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter.","Dave Zinsner","Thanks, Sanjay. Micron\u2019s fiscal third quarter results were within the guided revenue range and above the guided EPS range that we provided on our last call. We also generated healthy levels of free cash flow and made further progress on our share repurchase program. Total fiscal third quarter revenue of approximately $4.8 billion was at the midpoint of our guidance range and was down 39% on a year-over-year basis and down 18% sequentially from FQ2. ","Both DRAM and NAND revenue were negatively impacted by restriction on sales to Huawei, without which we would have reached the high end of our revenue guidance. DRAM revenue was approximately $3 billion, representing 64% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 45% year-over-year and 19% sequentially from fiscal second quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the DRAM ASP decline approached 20%, while bit shipments were roughly flat.","If not for the impact of Huawei, bit shipments in DRAM would have increased sequentially as we had guided on our last quarter\u2019s earnings call. NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing 31% of total revenue. NAND revenue declined 25% relative to fiscal third quarter 2018 and declined 18% sequentially from the fiscal second quarter.","Overall NAND ASPs declined in the mid-teen\u2019s percent range, while shipment quantities declined in the mid-single-digit percent range compared to the prior quarter. Adjusting for the Huawei impact, bit shipments came in better than our expectation due to stronger component sales.","Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $2.1 billion, down 48% year-over-year and 13% from the prior quarter. Lower pricing across major market segments continued to be the leading cause of lower revenue. However, normalized customer inventory levels led to shipment volume growth in fiscal third quarter, particularly in graphics and client.","Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.2 billion, down 33% year-over-year and down 27% from fiscal second quarter due in part to lower shipments to Huawei. Lower pricing and DRAM volume drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. Our managed NAND portfolio continued to show strength in fiscal third quarter with bit shipments increasing by","over 200% year-over-year.","The Embedded Business Unit revenue of $700 million was down 22% from the prior year and down 12% from fiscal second quarter. Revenue was adversely impacted by broad macroeconomic weakness, weaker pricing, and inventory adjustments in the consumer segment. Automotive and industrial, which represented almost 75% of EBU revenue showed strong margin resilience, with gross margins down only 300 basis points from the last fiscal quarter.","Finally, the Storage Business Unit third quarter revenue was $813 million, down 29% year-over-year and down 20% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by competitive pricing and an unfavorable comparison on component volumes coming off a large one-time sale we completed in the prior fiscal quarter.","The consolidated gross margin for fiscal third quarter was 39%, compared to 61% in the prior year and 50% in fiscal second quarter. Lower pricing in both DRAM and NAND was the primary driver of the lower margin in the fiscal quarter. Gross margins were also negatively impacted by approximately 200 basis points, due to underutilization charges related to IMFT. ","U.S. tariffs on imports from China were less than 30 basis point impact to gross margins, as we have successfully mitigated approximately 90% of the impact from tariffs. Fiscal third quarter NAND gross margins remained above 25%.","Operating expenses of $774 million were well within our guided range. As we\u2019ve said on prior calls, our goal with OpEx is to remain disciplined with respect to expense control, while continuing to invest in future products and technologies throughout the market cycle. Operating expenses also benefited from the strong execution on qualification of our 1Z nanometer mobile-DRAM product ahead of our internal schedule.","We delivered solid profitability in the fiscal third quarter with operating income of $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue. This margin is down 28 percentage points year-over-year and down 13 percentage points from FQ2. Non-GAAP taxes included $162 million of benefits in FQ3, due to a favorable state tax law change and a change in our annual tax rate from 10.5% to 9%. ","Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal third quarter was $1.05, down from $3.15 in the year-ago quarter and down from $1.71 in the prior quarter. Fiscal third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 higher due to the $162 million of tax benefits.","Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations in the fiscal third quarter, representing 57% of revenues. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was approximately $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion in the prior quarter. We still expect fiscal 2019 CapEx at approximately $9 billion, however we expect meaningfully lower CapEx in fiscal 2020.","In the fiscal third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less net CapEx, was approximately $500 million, compared to $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter and $1 billion in the fiscal second quarter. We bought back approximately $157 million of stock in the fiscal third quarter, representing 3.8 million shares. ","For the fiscal year-to-date, we\u2019ve returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks, which represents approximately 70% of our year-to-date free cash flow. Combined with the redemptions of outstanding converts, we have reduced outstanding share count by over 8% since fiscal third quarter 2018.","We will continue to prudently manage capital according to our philosophy of maintaining liquidity throughout the cycle, investing in capital assets to enable cost-effective node transitions and back-end cost competitiveness, and returning over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.","Inventory ended the quarter at $4.9 billion, increasing from $4.4 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. The fiscal third quarter ended with 151 days of inventory outstanding, or 143 days using our average inventory balance for the fiscal third quarter. As we mentioned on the last call, calendar 2020 NAND bit supply will be constrained as we make the transition to replacement gate.","To meet expected bit demand growth, we are carrying higher levels of NAND inventory in calendar 2019 and 2020. We also project to carry higher-than-normal levels of DRAM inventory in calendar 2019 as industry supply and demand work toward getting into balance.","Total cash ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, down quarter-over-quarter, largely as a result of our $1.4 billion redemption of our Series G convertible notes announced last quarter and completed in FQ3. Total liquidity exceeded $10 billion at quarter-end, while we maintained a healthy balance sheet.","In the quarter, we announced that the close of the IMFT joint venture acquisition will be October 31, which is during our fiscal first quarter of 2020. We expect to pay approximately $1.4 billion for Intel\u2019s share of IMFT. A portion of the payment will also be used to repay member debt financing, which at the end of the fiscal third quarter was approximately $860 million.","Now, turning to our financial outlook. Both the DRAM and NAND markets remain over-supplied. Having said that, we are starting to see some signs of bit demand improvement. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect strong growth in our DRAM bit shipments for the cloud, graphics, and PC markets in fiscal fourth quarter, followed by more normal bit growth in the fiscal first quarter.","In NAND, while the industry is benefitting from elasticity kicking in, our bit shipment growth in FQ4 will be limited, due to the ongoing transition of our SSD portfolio. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 29% plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $785 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.45, plus or minus $0.07.","In closing, despite the industry and geopolitical challenges, Micron continues to execute on our key initiatives and remains on strong financial footing. We will continue to draw on our strong relationships with our customers and manage through this cycle with a focus on gross margins and free cash flow.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Dave. Clearly, fiscal 2019 has been challenging for both Micron and the industry. While we continue to believe that the industry is structurally stronger, the confluence of events that impacted this year was unprecedented. Still, we have fared better due to the tremendous progress we have made on improving our product costs, advancing our technology, and increasing the mix of high value solutions.","Recent industry financial results show that Micron\u2019s profitability and balance sheet are best-in-class. Having said that, we are not resting on our recent accomplishments and are continuing to raise the bar for ourselves. Our CapEx and expense controls reflect our focus on profitability and free cash flow. With the economic and trade challenges facing the industry, the near term continues to be uncertain. But looking beyond these challenges, I\u2019m excited about Micron\u2019s future.","We are in the early innings of growth in cloud computing, and the value of data in the new economy is going to drive secular growth in numerous memory and storage-intensive applications. AI, autonomous vehicles, 5G, and IoT will drive significant improvements in our lives, and we look forward to bringing the value of our innovative, market-leading solutions to our customers.","In April, we issued our fourth annual sustainability report, which details Micron\u2019s commitment to enhancing the world we live in through our products and our business practices. We achieved perfect scores on industry-standard environmental and social audits of our facilities in 2018 and 2019.","Our ongoing focus and improvements in sustainable practices is a competitive differentiator for both our customers and our employees, and an important part of the transformation we are driving at Micron. I\u2019m energized by the potential ahead of us and proud of the culture of innovation and execution that we are building.","We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide a little more granularity on Huawei. You talked about the ability to sell subset of products, can you walk through, I guess, where you are allowed, where you are not? They are, I believe a [13%] customer at least quarter fiscal year. What kind of impact do you expect as we proceed in the coming quarters across both DRAM and NAND?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, as I said in the prepared remarks, after the Huawei was placed on entity list, we began review of our products against the export administration required regulations and through that analysis we determined that certain of our products, a subset of our products that we were previously shipping to Huawei could continue to ship because it is lawful it is compliant to those export regulations. And you know of course, it had impact as Dave noted.","In our FQ3, it had an impact because we could not ship at that time any product to them of nearly $200 million. And for FQ4, there would be impact to our revenue. What I would say is, that our revenue with Huawei in FQ4 would be less than what it otherwise would have been if Huawei was not on the entity listing. And of course, as we look ahead beyond FQ4, if Huawei continues to be on the entity list then in fiscal year 2020 as well, we would have an impact compared to what our revenue with Huawei would have been if they were not on the entity listing.","Of course, we are a supplier to all customers in all end markets across the globe and we will \u2013 and our presence with several of those other customers is growing in terms of our penetration there, in terms of our share there. And we will continue to work on adjusting those, but we would not be able to make up in fiscal year 2020 if this were to continue the full shortfall and all though we plan to make a part of it through other parts of the business.","C.J. Muse","That's very helpful. And if I could \u2026","Sanjay Mehrotra","And it affects both our DRAM, as well as the NAND side of the business.","C.J. Muse","Okay, great. Thank you. And if I could follow up on CapEx, you talked about a meaningful cut. I guess, is meaningful meaning [indiscernible] territory? And as part of that, is it more focused on DRAM, NAND, both, how should we think about the implications there? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, with respect to CapEx, we have said meaningful reduction in CapEx from the fiscal year 2019 levels. And we will provide more details in the next call as we finalize our plans. Of course, our goal is to have our long-term considerations in mind with respect to technology and product cost capability, but most importantly to have our supply bit growth aligned with our expectations of demand bit growth.","And when we look at supply bit growth, of course, we keep in mind the inventory that we are carrying from fiscal year 2019 into fiscal year 2020 for both DRAM, as well as NAND, which will help us supply some of the demand requirement in fiscal year 2020 and enable us to reduce our CapEx requirements in fiscal year 2020 and our CapEx management, of course, applies to both NAND, as well as DRAM.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your question please.","Mark Newman","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call, taking my question. And the first question really following on Huawei, can you give a little bit more quantification on how much the 13% or so revenue you expect you will be able to continue to export to Huawei? And can you give us some guidance also for your bit growth for this next quarter? I don't think you have mentioned that yet on the earnings \u2013 on the guidance, if you can mention about your expectation for bit growth for the following quarter? And I have a follow-up question. Thanks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, with respect to Huawei, as I've said before, our revenue expectation in fiscal Q4 is less than what it would have been without Huawei being on the entity list. Beyond that we don't really get into specifics in terms of revenue etcetera on a customer by customer basis. Of course, our revenue expectation with Huawei is baked into the guidance, revenue guidance that Dave provided for FQ4 of $4.5 billion plus or minus $200 million. And your second question, with respect to \u2026","Dave Zinsner","So, on DRAM bit growth, we said it would be up meaningfully in the fourth quarter, NAND will be more modest given the environment.","Mark Newman","Okay. Thanks, thanks very much Dave and Sanjay. My final question is really taking a step back and looking at the industry, you know clearly it has been the quite challenging year, this year with the oversupply, but just looking forward to 2020 with the pretty severe cuts, you guys are making on utilization and CapEx and with similar cuts from some of your competitors in Asia, I'm just curious what you think for next year, I guess it very much depends on the economic outlook, which is a little bit unpredictable at the moment, but looking forward to 2020, do you not think that there could be a danger of potential under supply at some point next year? I'm just curious how you're thinking about that because to me, this level of utilization and CapEx, it seems like inevitably there will be a period of under supply coming, just a matter of time.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, as we have said, the industry is in oversupply right now, both in DRAM, as well as in NAND. And while demand is increasing in the second half both for NAND and DRAM, the oversupply situation does persist and we have talked about in DRAM, challenging pricing environment and therefore it's important that CapEx cuts are made, as well as supply bit growth has managed to bring the supply bit growth in line with the demand growth, as well as over time to bring inventories in line with expectations as well. So, we are not providing a fiscal year 2020 guidance at this point, but all of the actions that we are taking here are really targeted to restore the industry demand and supply balance over the course of next few quarters.","Mark Newman","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Sanjay, congratulations on the solid execution given the industry conditions. Just going back to the CapEx questions, I would argue Sanjay that one of the biggest strategic initiatives you\u2019ve had has been to try to close the cost gap with your peers. And clearly CapEx is a pretty important tool in which to do that, you guys are sort of bucking the trend this fiscal year with CapEx actually up slightly versus peers that have actually taken it down. I'm just kind of curious, help us get some comfort level that despite the cuts you're talking about for the fiscal year 2020 you're still very much on plan relative to closing those cost gaps with your peers?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, certainly as you noted, we have made tremendous improvement in our cost position and with respect to our peers and that reflects in our financial performance. As was noted in the prepared remarks, our margin improvement, relative margin improvement from previous times has really improved by 2,000 basis points and that's because of our execution on the cost front, as well as on the execution on the high value solutions front. And of course, we have more room to go with respect to cost competitiveness, as well as strengthening our high value solutions portfolio.","So, we are extremely focused on this and you know as we look at driving our future opportunities, we of course when we make our CapEx decisions, we make them based on cost competitiveness off our supply in the future and of course, keeping in mind our free cash flow considerations and most important is that our total supply available to us coming from our inventory and coming from our supply bit growth should be matching with our demand expectations going forward over the course of next few quarters and to continue to improve our inventory position. But on the cost side, we feel very good about the 1Y and 1Z progress on DRAM, as well as we feel good about our 96-layer.","And overall, even with the CapEx reductions that we\u2019re talking about, we'll be in a good position with respect to cost both in DRAM and NAND next year. Of course we have talked about in NAND, our first generation replacement gate node will be a small node, in the sense that it will be deployed across a small set of products and we will not have any significant cost benefit from that first generation replacement gate node, but the second generation replacement gate node will give us meaningful cost benefit, compared to the last generations of floating gate node. So, we absolutely are on top of the game in terms of managing to our cost objectives.","Dave Zinsner","I'd just add that, you know, Sanjay already mentioned this drive to high value solutions. In other way we can improve our gross margins, but also the node transitions isn't the only way we affect the cost of the product and so one example is, for example, the back-end we're very acutely focused on the back-end we are bringing some of that activity that we were doing that was being outsourced internally. We think we can improve our cost structure in that regard to. So, there are many ways we can drive the cost to improve it.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And one thing I would add is, in terms of our overall CapEx that you mentioned, of course, as you know that in fiscal year 2019, we had meaningful part of our CapEx around $2 billion that was actually tied to facilities, cleanroom expansions to enable technology transitions. And this facility spend, may not be the same from one manufacturer to the other manufacturers, but for us that was a meaningful part. Again, as noted in our remarks before, to prepare us for technology transitions and not targeting any of that cleanroom space for any meaningful capacity, but really for technology transition.","John Pitzer","Thanks Sanjay. And then David, just on inventory, it's clearly a key metric that investors are looking at. I'm kind of curious is how we should think about inventory levels exiting the fiscal fourth quarter? And as you answer the question, clearly the inventory is somewhat a reflection of where we are in the cycle, but you've got sort of the added burden of wanting to build some NAND inventory as you make this transition to replacement gate. So, how would inventories look if you sort of normalize for that? And then lastly as part of the question, I apologize, utilization coming down, CapEx coming down is a good way of controlling inventory, so was the potential for write-downs, can you just talk about how you're thinking about the value of the inventory in this sort of environment?","Dave Zinsner","A three-part question, John. Okay, so the inventories obviously are elevated right now. As you point out, one of the big drivers of our increased inventory level is in NAND. And that is kind of by design for us. We are trying to build up some inventory going into 2020, fiscal 2020 for us because we are going to make this transition to replacement gate. Replacement gate doesn't drive very much bit growth for us in the first node in replacement gate. And so, we'll need to draw on our inventory in order to meet demand, and that's \u2013 I don't know the exact number, but that's a decent chunk of the [overage] in terms of days.","The other aspect of the elevated level of inventory is in DRAM. That was a little bit more a function of pretty good bit growth in the first couple of quarters of the calendar year of 2019 and of course we had had customers working down their inventories and so inventory was building up in our balance sheet. We do expect now that we're in a place, Sanjay mentioned that we're seeing inventories get to be in a good place in the cloud space, in the graphic space, in the PC space. And so, we would expect to start to see inventories start to come down now. ","We think we'll be in a relatively good spot by the end of the calendar year, may not be at quote unquote optimal levels, but certainly in a healthier place and then quick quickly after that I would expect DRAM to be in a good place. From a write down perspective, we did write down about $40 million of inventory this quarter specific to Huawei. We finished goods inventory with Huawei that does not look like that's going to get sold, so we did reserve that. Outside of that, from a kind of an obsolescence perspective, we don't see really any risk with the inventory we're carrying.","We think it's very good inventory, it got a good cost position, very good demand with that inventory. So, unlikely to have any issue as it relates to obsolescence. The other of course area, you have to concern yourself with is the, any sort of lower cost to market issue with the inventory. I think you can kind of guess by the quality of our gross margins that we are not really in danger of having any write-down associated with lower cost to market. So, outside of these kind of one-off issues that we deal with from time to time, like we did with Huawei this quarter I don't really see a big issue with inventory in terms of write-downs or reserves.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So before going to the next question, I just wanted to make a small correction. In the prepared comments, I mentioned that QLC shipments were up approximately 75%, I meant to say that QLC bit shipments were up 75% quarter-over-quarter. So, just wanted to make that correction. And now I think we can move on to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital. Your question please.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you very much. Sanjay, good to see the discipline here on the CapEx and also with Dave\u2019s focus on free cash flow. I was just a little confused, I want to make sure I understood this. If we go \u2013 and I appreciate that you don't want to talk about any specific customer, but if you go back to the reported last two quarters and if you triangulate that if you exclude Huawei that will mean that bit shipments would be at best up single-digit. So, the question is in your CapEx thinking for fiscal 2020, how are you handicapping the Huawei impact? Are you expecting this to continue to be on that list and hence your CapEx, lower CapEx includes a certain amount of capacity being taken offline because of that, what's the right way to think about it? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, I think we will be able to provide you more details related to fiscal year 2020 CapEx etcetera in our next earnings call. I would just point out that there is obviously considerable uncertainty here. As you can all see from the rather fluid situation with respect to Huawei, as well as with respect to U.S., China trade matters and of course we are just staying focused on optimizing what we can control, and really remaining nimble in our actions. ","You have seen that how over the course of last one year we have for fiscal year 2019 managed our CapEx down from $10.5 billion plus, minus 5% to $9 billion now. So, we continue to stay vigilant and we are making decisive actions with respect to meaningful CapEx reductions in fiscal year 2020. But with respect to the further details, we will be in a better position to provide you information at the next earnings call.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, I appreciate that Sanjay. And then as a quick follow-up, and it's not a multi-part day for you, what's the AR or DSO target that we should be thinking about as we go through the next couple of quarters? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes. So, it got up there and we did kind of work it down this quarter. I think we got it down to about 62 days. I would say ideally, it should be in the 50s, it was a little bit of a mix challenge this quarter that kind of drove it up a bit. And there is a couple of customers that have extended terms and they kind of hit us at that point, but ideally, we'd like to be somewhere in the mid-50s.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citi. Your question please.","Chris Danely","Thanks guys. You said you've mitigated I think 90% of the tariff so far. Now we're looking at another $300 billion in tariffs. Can you estimate the approximate impact to your business if that goes through?","Sanjay Mehrotra","I would say that as we of course, we don't know for sure what the list looks like. We have a general sense based on what we've seen there is minimal impact from the incremental list. Most of what affects us was contemplated in the first two 1A, 1B, and then the second list.","Chris Danely","Got it. And then for my follow-up. Sanjay talked about 5G and the big driver with the Huawei issue is that impacting the development of 5G, have you seen any change in like the ongoing development of the standards out there?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, I think it is too soon to tell. And keep in mind that in certain countries 5G has already started to be deployed, such as Korea and there are of course leading suppliers, other than Huawei as well for 5G. So, will remain to be seen how this deployment occurs over the course of next few quarters, in particular here. But there is no doubt that you know 5G will bring about greater applications for memory and storage, not only in smartphones, but also in machine-to-machine on the IoT front.","And all of this will drive greater demand for memory and storage and we remain absolutely well prepared, of course, in a flexible fashion to meet the growing demand requirements for the business. That 5G, we think will provide over the course of next many years. But near term, in terms of exactly what happens with respect to Huawei aspects, I think really it is too soon to tell.","Chris Danely","Okay, thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. In DRAM, given the transition to 1Y and early 1Z move, can you guys just help us understand qualitatively your cost reduction profile as you move to the second half of this calendar year? Maybe compare that versus the cost downs in the first half of this year.","Sanjay Mehrotra","With respect to the cost declines, of course, we are continuing to execute well with respect to our nodes transitions, as well as continuing to drive cost declines the 1Y and 1Z nodes that you talked about, and we are on plan in terms of ramping up these nodes as well. And as I said before, we don't break out the cost reductions on first half versus second half. Of course, our expectations of cost reductions are baked into for FQ4, the gross margin guidance, as well as of course that takes into account our price decline assumptions as well for FQ4.","So, all of that is really baked into it, we don't break it down, but keep in mind that as the new technology nodes advance, the cost reduction coming from new technology nodes is less and less compared to the prior nodes just because as we have explained several times before they naturally give you \u2013 given the challenges of scaling less per wafer bit growth capability and less cost reduction capability.","Harlan Sur","Yes, thanks for the insights there. And then back in April, the team announced its 9300 series NVMe, this is their new cloud in enterprise, the SSD family. I think you guys have had solid momentum in cloud and enterprise with your SATA family and that's helped to sustain a better margin profile for the NAND business. So, what's the design win momentum been like on the 9300 series and when do you anticipate your cloud customers to start ramping these new NVMe products? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","As we have discussed in the past that we would be introducing over the course of our fiscal year 2019, actually during calendar year 2019, our NVMe products and we started that first with consumer NVMe and later with our OEM NVMe that we talked about today. And now also for cloud and enterprise applications NVMe drive and these will take some period of time over the course of next few months in terms of getting qualified by customers, in terms of gaining traction with customers and that's why we had mentioned that 2019 will basically be a year of transition for us from SATA to NVMe.","I just want to remind you that couple of years ago, Micron did not actually have investments in NVMe product development. We did very well and are continuing to do very well in SATA as you noted, and we began to significantly increase our investments in NVMe product development couple of years ago, and it takes a while to have these products in the marketplace. So, in 2020, as our NVMe solutions get adopted by our customers and as we ramp those into production, we do expect to be gaining share with NVMe all throughout the 2020 timeframe.","Harlan Sur","Thanks Sanjay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your question please.","Timothy Arcuri","And that's been asked a couple of times. And I'm just trying to figure out how lower CapEx, you're going to cut CapEx by a couple of billion and you're certainly cutting wafer starts quite a bit, how that does ultimately have some negative impact on your costs? I think you've been costing down in DRAM, maybe low to mid-teens and the expectation was that you'd be down somewhere that 2020 would be kind of another good year for DRAM cost downs and you've been down kind of like mid-20s in NAND. So, yet it sounds like you're saying that it does not having much of an effect on your costs, so I'm just trying to fit those two things? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","No, I'm not saying that it will not have effect on cost. What I'm saying is that we will be in good position with cost because our technologies \u2013 underlying technologies, give us good cost reduction capabilities from one node to the next node. Overall, from our cost point of view, we'll be in good position and for NAND I'll just remind you that you know our CMOS under the array technology gives us the smallest die size in the industry and that has meaningful implications with respect to the cost competitiveness that we have.","So, overall, we feel good about the technology and the production mix that we will be driving through the remainder of fiscal year 2019, as well as through fiscal year 2020 in terms of meeting our demand expectations, as well as remaining cost competitive.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks for that. And then I guess just related to that maybe Dave, can you maybe break down CapEx sort of how much is building versus equipment, it sounds like there is roughly 2 billion that was buildings this year in fiscal 2019. Is the cut next year going to be almost all in infrastructure so that WFE is kind of flat to down smidge, year-over-year? Is that kind of how to think about it? Thanks.","Dave Zinsner","So, getting back to the FY 2019 just to be clear, what Sanjay said was about $2 billion was kind of construction related spend, the rest is front-end and back-end. So, there is some \u2013 and some miscellaneous capital spend for R&D group and so forth. So, there is more to it than even that. I'll be honest with you, we have not, you kind of completely finalized CapEx budget for next year. We have a pretty good sense of directionally where it is going, but all the pieces specifically were not quite there yet. And so, what we'd like to do is wait and give you more granularity around that in the next quarter's call. But I would anticipate that both areas would have some reduction to them.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, awesome. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Sort of follow up on the Huawei point. Just want to make sure I understood what you're saying. Are you able to ship because the IP resides in another country? Just trying to understand how exactly are you able to continue to ship? And then just kind of curious as you look out, I'm sure there's going to be some components that go into these phones from other vendors that don't have an ability to ship, so I'm kind of just curious your thoughts on kind of downstream impacts and whether you've encapsulated all that?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, with respect to what we are able to ship to Huawei, as I said before that what we are able to ship is what is not under the export administration regulations. And that's what we are able to ship and actually export administration regulations have various complex aspects and considerations several criteria that you have to go through, if you're interested in that, you can certainly go to the BIS site and look for those and we assess our products versus those and you know these considerations are not just limited to any one or two aspects such as what you mentioned, I mean they have several aspects and we assess our products that we can ship to Huawei versus those and have made determination or shipments and we, as we said, we began those shipments in last two weeks.","With respect to your question around other components etcetera, of course this is a company by company decision and each company has to evaluate its own situation and obviously Huawei has to look at its own supply chain. So, with respect to the products that we can ship to them, we work closely with them to understand what is their latest demand on those products, and that is what is baked into our FQ4 guidance.","What I would like to point out here is that at the end of the day since you asked the question about mobile phones. The smartphone demand overall from consumers point of view is really going to be the same. I mean, consumers are going to be buying the phones that they're going to buy, based on the features, the new models, all of that will be bought there may be some share shift that maybe occurring between the various suppliers of smartphones and as you know, we are well engaged with customers across the smartphone ecosystem as a supplier to them.","Of course, you know Huawei was our number one customer, we continue to engage with other customers as well. And we have had growing presence with those other customers and we'll continue to look for opportunities to best optimize our business while always of course continuing to comply with US laws and regulations and for that matter we always comply with laws and regulations in all countries that we operate in.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you on the cloud data center, obviously an important segment and you did have some encouraging comments, just kind of curious on that pace of recovery maybe versus what you had thought a quarter ago, just kind of the health of the channel and the pace of recovery there. Thanks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Pace of recovery \u2026","Dave Zinsner","In cloud and data center.","Sanjay Mehrotra","For cloud and data center. I mean, as we said I think cloud customers, as well as several other customers had operated with high levels of inventory in the \u2013 starting late last year and through the course of first half of this year those inventory levels have been largely worked to normal levels. Except for in enterprise, as we noted in our prepared remarks and we look forward to robust growth in fiscal fourth quarter in the area of cloud and you know we are, of course, continuing to broaden our product portfolio as well with solutions such as NVMe solutions and that will bring us bigger opportunities in the future as well.","Blayne Curtis","Okay.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Ivan Donaldson. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Ivan Donaldson","Thank you, Latif. And welcome to Micron Technology\u2019s first quarter 2017 fiscal conference call. On the call with me today are Mark Durcan, CEO and Director; and Ernie Maddock, Chief Financial Officer. This conference call, including audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com. ","In addition, our website contains the earnings press release filed a short while ago and supplemental information including quarterly operational and financial metrics and guidance, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, slides used during today\u2019s conference call, and a convertible debt and capped call dilution table.","Today\u2019s call will be approximately 60 minutes in length.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-Q and 10-K for a complete discussion of these important factors and other risks that may affect our future results.","Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today\u2019s date to conform these statements to actual results.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion. In the first quarter, we saw an acceleration of the positive market conditions to begin this fall. ","For the industry, supply is slowing demand is stronger on a number of key segments and inventory is at low levels. Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading SDRAM and NAND products and we see this trend continuing into the current quarter. ","To give you some perspective on pricing dynamics. After declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing driven by an improvement in demand, with slightly low inventory levels and the impact of supply shifts to other segments. In contrast to all other DRAM segments declined substantially less over the same period and are recovering at a slower rate. ","Given the duration of a broad supply and demand tightness in the market, we are currently seeing improvements in quarter-over-quarter pricing trends in these non-PC segments. Taking all these variables together, blended DRAM ASPs are essentially flat compared to the same period last year. ","With this in mind and as we look at our current quarter, operational execution is driving DRAM sales up more than $1 billion year-over-year, while our cost-of-good-sold is up only about half this amount, driving substantial improvements in gross margins. ","Product mix has a more significant impact on the NAND landscape where we are also experiencing like-for-like pricing increases. However, we are also shifting our product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND, which enables higher density and lower cost products that also have lower ASPs. Taking together, blended NAND ASPs are down approximately 10% year-over-year, while gross margins are up meaningfully.","Turning to the industry outlook, we are currently -- we currently expect 2017 DRAM Disk supply growth in the 15% to 20% range. This is based on an assumption that suppliers\u2019 won\u2019t add significant wafer for capacity to the industry, but will continue to focus on process node migrations to enable cost reductions and natural supply growth. ","This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 20% to 25%. We expect favorable supply and demand dynamics to persist in 2017. For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. ","This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 40% to 45%. 3D conversions continue to be a headwind to industry supply growth. This factor along with strong demand for storage and mobile solutions sets up for a well-balanced supply and demand dynamic in 2017.","I\u2019ll now provide a high level overview of each of our business units and Ernie will follow with more details on the specific financial performances. In the Compute and Networking business unit, we experience revenue growth as a result of strengthening or strengthened demand. ","We executed well to our 20 nanometer shipment plan and achieved key qualifications of 64 gigabyte LRDIMMs at multiple server customers. We also continued our strong performance in the graphic segment, where our GDDR5X Technology leads competitors.","In our mobile business unit, the completion of our customer qualifications drove substantial revenue and profit growth this quarter. As noted last quarter, we continue to see the Chinese market driving mobile growth and higher memory content for smartphone. ","We have strong growth in our LPDRAM and mobile NAND product lines and are focused on new qualification opportunities as we see the mobile market as one of the strongest growth drivers of our business.","Our Embedded business was driven by strong demand across a variety of segments. Our NAND based MCPs continue to win business in machine-to-machine communications modules and our strong portfolio also brought us significant share in several new home automation and action camera platforms this quarter. We expect our new application optimize SD cards to drive market share gains within both industrial and connected home segments. ","Our automotive business had another excellent quarter. We are securing an increasing number of automotives design wins on our leading edge, managed NAND and 20 nanometer DRAM products. We also see automotive demand for advanced memory technology is accelerating as more sophisticated ADAS systems come to market in the years ahead.","Our storage business unit continued to make progress shifting our portfolio to advanced 3D NAND technologies. First, the 1,100 client SSDs we announced last quarter completed qualifications and we commenced volume shipments with several major customers. This compliments our crucial MX 300 consumer drive, which is currently shipping at high volumes. ","Additionally we announced our cloud based 5100 SATA ESSD earlier this month offering industry leading performance in 8 terabyte capacities. All three of these SSDs are built with our TLC 3D NAND and illustrate our focus portfolio transition to this high capacity, high performance and cost effective technology.","We continue to provide updates with respect to critical targets related to operational execution originally shared at our Analyst Day in August 2015. Thus far these milestones including bit crossover in 20 nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND and the SSD product release roadmap have all been achieved on or ahead of schedule. ","Our two year bit growth and cost per bit targets remain on track and we continue to be focused on delivering to our commitments. Our focus in DRAM this year is primarily related to the deployment of our 1X nanometer technology. We're targeting meaningful output on 1X by the latter part of fiscal 2017. We expect to generate approximately 20% to 25% cost per bit reductions in fiscal 2017. Our cash cost for bit declines will be well above this range.","For NAND we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen One 3D as well as TLC. We've also commenced production on our second generation 64 layer 3D technology and we're targeting meaningful output by the latter part of fiscal 2017. The 3D and TLC ramps will deliver 22% to 25% cost per bit improvement in fiscal 2017. This cost per bit includes the impact of expanding our SSD, EMCP and managed NAND solutions which carry additional building materials and cost, but will also enable a richer ASP mix. ","Relative to 3D XPoint technology we will be shipping our QuantX solutions for revenue in 2017 and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success. ","This month just after our quarter closed, we finalized the acquisition of Inotera in Taiwan, which we expect to continue to provide strategic and financial opportunities for the company. We are excited to welcome the Inotera team to Micron and look forward to realizing the benefits of the new operating model.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie. ","Ernie Maddock","Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. ","Today, I'll first discuss some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's result for the quarter and guidance for our fiscal second quarter. DRAM represented 61% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile represented about 30%, up from 25% to prior quarter. ","The PC segment was in the mid-20% range and the server business was in the high-teens percent range. Specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies was in the mid-20% range down from the prior quarter. In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 32% of total revenue with the following segmentation.","Consumer which includes memory cards, USB and components represented 40% down from the prior quarter. Mobile was in the low-20% range up from the prior quarter as we saw the continued impact of our completed customer qualifications. ","As a reminder, AMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-teens range up from the prior quarter and the automotive industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the 20% range.","Turning to performance by business unit, the compute and networking business unit reporting fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.47 billion, up 18% sequentially, primarily due to stronger demand and higher 20 nanometer shipments and a stronger pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating profit was $204 million or 14% of revenue. ","In the enterprise segment, we executed well in shipping 20 nanometer solutions to the market and qualified several lower cost products at multiple customers.","Cloud was CNB's fastest growing segment and Micron is now qualified on most high volume sockets for the top customers in this segment. Demand is being driven by both our leading edge DDR4 solutions, as well as continuing need for DDR3. ","In graphics, we had continued share growth in GDDR with our major graphics customers. New graphics card launches and strong console sales sustain favorable demand for both GDDR5 and GDDR5-X. In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continue transaction to 20 nanometer, 4 gigabyte DDR3 and 8 gigabyte DDR4. We continue to see strong interest in our high performance memory portfolio as well.","Finally within the client segment, ASP strength exceeded our expectations and solid execution on 20 nanometer drove improved shipments and cost reductions. The mobile business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.03 billion, up 54% sequentially driven by completed customer qualifications and strong sales and LPDRAM and mobile NAND products in an improved pricing environment. ","The non-GAAP operating income was $89 million or 9% of revenue as we continue to ramp our 20 nanometer products and made substantial progress reducing higher cost early production inventory.","The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $578 million, up 13% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $178 million or 31% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by seasonally strong consumer business and record automotive revenue. Embedded ASP trends tend to be more stable compared to the broader compute and mobile market, but we are beginning to see the benefit of tightening supply demand in this business unit as well. ","Consumer revenue was up 25% sequentially, driven by home automation and camera application. In addition our 20 nanometer DDR4 product continue to ramp into some 4-K set-top box applications. The automotive business performed well with revenue up 7% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. These solid results continue to be driven by strong and increasing demand for both DDR3 and e-MMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and LPDRAM for advanced driver assistance systems applications.","The industrial and multi market business increase 6% sequentially with a strong quarter for our NOR business combined with ramping our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see growing demand for our industrial grade managed NAND solutions.","The storage business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $860 million, up 13% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 5% of revenue. During the quarter SBU strengthened both the NAND and SSD product portfolio having now entered fully ramped production and customer qualification of 3D TLC NAND clients and cloud drives. ","Our ramp of 3D TLC cost competitive products will positions us to effectively participate more fully in this growth segment. SBU is also benefiting from a favorable supply demand balance in the industry with like-for-like pricing improving for many products. Demand drivers look strong for the foreseeable future.","Moving on to overall company results, revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $3.97 billion, up 23% sequentially and driven by strong volume shipments for DRAM combined with increasing ASPs. Trade NAND shipments also increased as a result of the successful crossover of 3D production, which occurred in the quarter and we experienced stable blended ASPs with like-for-like ASPs trending up in many cases.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26%, up from 19% in the prior quarter, driven by a strong pricing environment particularly for DRAM and solid execution on cost per bit reductions. NAND cost reductions were driven by an ongoing ramp of 3D and the portfolio shifting to higher density TLC enabled solutions. Non-GAAP net income was $335 million or $0.32 per share.","Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 24% compared to the prior quarter, as a result of an 18% increase in bit shipments and a 5% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the first quarter increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 28%, primarily driven by the strong pricing environment and continued 20 nanometer RAM. Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 26% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 26% increase in bit shipments. ","ASPs were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter on a blended basis. Gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 23% as cost per bit was down 8% benefiting from the 3D and TLC ramps.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $594 million slightly below the lower end of our guided range, driven by lower prequalification expenses, lower legal costs and higher expense sharing credits. The company generated cash flow of $1.1 billion an increase of $200 million over last quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.3 billion. In the first fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.18 billion.","Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter, on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following. Consolidated revenue in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.7 billion, gross margin in the range of 31% to 34%, operating expenses between $590 million and $640 million, operating income ranging between $800 million and $900 million, and EPS ranging between $0.58 and $0.68 per share based on 1,123,million diluted shares.","Please note that as indicated earlier this month, we expect the impact from the Inotera acquisition to be accretive beginning this quarter. Specifically for fiscal quarter two we expect the accretion to positively impact gross margins by low single-digit percentage and contribute approximate $0.02 to EPS. These impacts have already been included in the guidance I just provided and will not be further distinguished as we provide guidance in future quarters.","From an operational perspective we remain on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that was previously shared and we look forward to sharing more details on our progress and plans at our analyst conference on February 2nd. ","With that, I will turn it back to Mark. ","Mark Durcan","Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we're entering our second quarter with a number of positive drivers across the business. The markets for both DRAM and NAND are healthy and improving and I'm pleased with our operational execution over the past several quarters. We will continue deploying leading edge technology and shifting our product portfolio toward higher value segments and products.","Operator, we're now ready to begin the Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open. ","Chris Hemmelgarn","Hey this is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne, thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the great quarter. I guess first of all just regarding Inotera, could you help us understand kind of roughly how much you expect consolidating it fully consolidating operations to add to bit output on the DRAM side in the February quarter?","Ernie Maddock","We already had included the benefits of that since we took the 100% of the output. So it really represents no material change to anything we\u2019ve provided previously. ","Chris Hemmelgarn","No, I just mean in terms of obviously you'd expect the recognized bit output to be up quarter-on-quarter. Any guide in terms of what percentage of the existing?","Mark Durcan","No. Obviously we said all along that as we have full managerial control of the entity, we will have increased operational flexibility and the opportunity to potentially fine tune some of our management practices et cetera. We expect that overtime that will provide some modest benefits to manufacturing efficiency. All of those are baked into our overall projections on a go forward basis. And we don't anticipate breaking out individual FABs for you on a go forward basis. ","Chris Hemmelgarn","Okay, that's helpful. And then as quick follow up. It's been obviously a lot in the news about potential changes to policies with the new presidential administration coming in, as I recall that you guys had a chance to kind a sit-down and chat some of that over with them. I was just curious if you had any thoughts about how some of the rule [ph] changes are going to impact your business in the coming years. ","Mark Durcan","Micron did not actually participate in the gathering of tech executives that happened recently. Through our activities, our ongoing activities and engagement with government we continue to stay involved in all sorts of policies that we believe impact our business. But there is really nothing specific that we would have to say about how that transition is going or anything of that nature at this point.","Chris Hemmelgarn","Okay, thanks so much and congrats again on the strong quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open. ","Vijay Rakesh","Hi, guys congratulation on a great set of results here. Just on the DRAM side, I know you mentioned that\u2019s obviously great results there as well, how is the 60 nanometer going, how do you see the transition to 60 nanometer actually progressed through the year?","Mark Durcan","I am sorry, to 1x nanometer.","Vijay Rakesh","Yeah.","Mark Durcan","On the DRAM front, we are very pleased with the product progress we are making, we have a number -- broad set of products that are supported by that 1x technology, its running in Japan as well as our DRAM FAB in Taichung and we have a number of mobile products as well as compute and server products all of which are progressing on schedule and we are quite happy with. ","Vijay Rakesh","Great. And on the 3D NAND side, happy to see you guys startup the second generation 64 layer. Any thoughts on how we should see that progress, obviously on cross over already, but how do you see the 64 layer ramping throughout 2017? Thanks. ","Mark Durcan","Yeah, just to reiterate. We believe it will be significant late in the fiscal year in terms of the bit output, it\u2019s a very significant shrink for us. So we are very excited about the efficiencies that it will bring to our operation, but its impact will occur later in the fiscal year.","Vijay Rakesh","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. ","Mark Delaney","Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question I was hoping you could help us understand the sustainability of some of the strong bit growth trends that you reported in the November quarter, I think you talked about growing above the market in 2017 in both DRAM and NAND, can you sustain some of these types of strong sequential bit growth trends as you look into February?","Ernie Maddock","Yeah, we don\u2019t have any bit growth update for you relative to the two year CAGR that we previously forecast, we are still on track to sustain those numbers and trying to get down to quarter-to-quarter we think is less productive than continue to focus on that long-term productivity increasing trend.","Mark Delaney","Got it, okay. And then for a follow-up questions I was hoping you could help us understand a little bit more of some of the end market trends in PCs and handsets and if you could elaborate specifically on what you are seeing in terms of demand trend in the China handset market?","Ernie Maddock","Yeah, so first of all on PCs, I think you have got the same market data we have there, but the PC industry ended up maybe a little stronger than any of us anticipated, still from a unit perspective flattish to maybe down a percent, but overall generating about 10% DRAM bit growth going into that segment. ","Mobile is interesting, we continue to see pretty good bit growth by system, on average for the mobile market probably move into 2.4 gigabyte of DRAM and high 30s somewhere in the 35% to 40% maybe in the middle of that range in terms of gigabytes of NAND.","So that would then -- if you net that out that\u2019s almost 20% DRAM bit growth for system and maybe little north of 40% on NAND. So for that market in aggregate pretty strong and in particular the value smartphone probably seeing the highest bit growth per system of any of those segments.","Ernie Maddock","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill of Needham and Company. Your line is open. ","Rajvindra Gill","Yes, thank you. Congratulations as well on excellent results. Housekeeping question first on the taxes, I think this quarter it was above $30 million, can you give some sense of what the guidance for taxes going forward will be?","Ernie Maddock","I think I\u2019ve guided to low-teens millions which would be kind of low single-digit tax rate and that will change as the company\u2019s profitability changes obviously when the profitability goes up the tax rate will sequentially decline a little bit because of where that income is generated and show the company's profitability decline the actually rate will creep up just a little bit.","Rajvindra Gill","Okay, great. And in the commentary you had mentioned around 15% to 20% bit supply growth in DRAM barring any additional supply from competitors. Can you talk a little bit about the -- what you're seeing in terms of the transition to 80 nanometer for some of your competitors? And is there risk in your mind in terms of additional supply coming online, any thoughts on that would be helpful.","Mark Durcan","We don't have great crystal ball as to where our competitors are doing. We read the same reports that you guys read. All of that plus all the other internal intelligence we can generate that baked into our ranges and in the data sheet that we provided. So I think there has been some chatter recently potentially about few incremental wafers from one of the suppliers. ","Our view of that is if that were to happen, it's a relatively minor adjustment in terms of the overall scope of the bit growth that we're projecting and it would probably not cause us to change that range that we\u2019ve giving you.","Rajvindra Gill","Alright great. And last question in terms of -- on the balance sheet, how do you think about kind of reducing the level of debt going forward now that you're entering into period of higher free cash flow generation we\u2019re at about $8.5 billion or close to $10 billion of debt. Any thoughts on the strategy about the reducing debt levels overtime?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, so to be consistent with my prior comments. First thing I want to do is make sure we generate the cash, which we're working on previously and expect to make some headway on here with the results we've just shared. ","And then as we get to that point and look at the credit markets, as well as a number of other factors, we will make a determination about the best way to delever, but delevering for the company remains an important priority as we have an expectation of increased free cash flow this year.","Rajvindra Gill","Okay, great. Thanks again. ","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen. Your question please. ","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you very much. First question I guess Mark you've made some recent comments about China and about them potentially splitting the market if they do get access to IT. So my question is can you again remind us of sort of what your mission statement is around the potential of sharing IT or licensing IT into China. Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Yeah, so first of all let me say that comments that I make in the press are sometimes not in the full context of the discussion I had. And I think one of the things to think about in terms of what might or might not happen in China is that these things do take time. Our investment cycles take place over a periods of useful life of equipment of five years. ","So we think in the long term when we think about investing in our business to make sure that we're being good stewards of the shareholders' money. But anything that would happen there is going to play out over many years. And having a crystal ball as to exactly how that will play out is difficult to say.","Relative to what Micron has said about our interests in China, we have a great interest in doing business in China. We have large existing operations there including backend operations, circuit design, product engineering activities as well as software and firmware activities. ","So we have a lot of activity in China already from an operations perspective. And we have a large number of important customers over there. So we stay fully engaged with China and continue to expect to have strong relationships there and grow our business.","Relative to whether we would undertake any expansion or licensing activity in China. What we said is really as it has been which is our job is to look for opportunities to make Micron a stronger company. And we will continue to investigate lots of options about ways to generate shareholder value whether it's in China or in any part of the world. ","And that\u2019s just part of us being effective managers of the company. And we'll continue to do that and if we can figure out things that make the stronger we'll always consider that in terms of the long-term benefits and act accordingly.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then I guess I had a follow-up for the question that was asked about some of the tax law changes coming. It seems pretty obvious that there is going to be some sort of that that gets added to product that\u2019s made outside the U.S. and you guys are obviously fairly exposed to that. ","So I am wondering, is there any like contingency planning happening and I am sort of trying to assess the likelihood that maybe CapEx might have to be a little higher as you may have to plan for some of those contingencies? Thanks.","Ernie Maddock","So Tim, I mean really it\u2019s an issue of what you think any such tariffs or what not. How they would impact our end market not necessarily as they directly impact Micron because typically we manufacture overseas, we sell in many cases overseas and then it\u2019s our customers who would then be subject to any of those importation issues. ","So I think it\u2019s really too soon to tell what the impact of that would be because simultaneously we\u2019re reading about a dramatic reduction of the corporate tax rate and also the ability to repatriate billions of dollars of cash. So there is a lot of moving pieces to this and I think anybody who would pertain to be able to specifically predict things is probably guessing a little bit right now.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay Ernie, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. I wonder if you can just give us some context on why the markets are so good. And I guess in particular you know when I look at your shipments have been stronger than I expected. Your competitor shipments have been a bit stronger than I expected and yet are mean our checks and everyone check show this good now and staying good for a while. ","Can you give us any context on why the supply demand balance has shifted so much in a favorable direction when everyone is kind of shipping more bits than the sort of long-term trend line?","Mark Durcan","Yes at the end of the day Joe it\u2019s got to be adding up all the pieces right and having less supply than demand. I will say that as the end markets that we ship into continue to segregate and the product has to find its way into the right or the wafer have to find their way into the right product at the right time for the right segment. ","Getting that balance exactly right segment-to-segment becomes difficult. And therefore I think it provides the opportunity for supply -- for pricing to react to changes in supply and demand in a way that\u2019s I think is positive from a manufacturers\u2019 perspective.","Joe Moore","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then secondly in terms of your NAND planning is there going to continue to be a long tail on the planer NAND business or do you see the whole business kind of transitioning to 3D overtime?","Mark Durcan","There is definitely a tail and it definitely exists for a long time. The question is how significant is that in terms of bits and what eventually will be the pricing in that long tail. I think that the planer bits are going to get squeezed out of a lot of the end market applications as we start to generate more 3D supply as an industry. ","However, there will be a long tail it\u2019s probably less than 10% of the overall market that sticks around for a long, long time and serves as very valuable niches. So it\u2019s a matter of getting that balance right and making sure that you have the product -- have the right products in that in those lagging nodes so you can address the right market opportunities. ","Joe Moore","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your question please. ","Steven Fox","Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the higher margin higher mix products where maybe where you mentioned like-for-like pricing also getting better for example in the storage business unit with SSDs. ","How are you managing your customer expectations for a longer design cycles and qualification cycles given that product is tight now and you are saying it could be tight for a while especially as you ramp 3D NAND and maybe it has some puts and takes along the way?","Mark Durcan","Yes, it\u2019s always tricky when you have customers with supply expectations making sure that you are making the right commitments that you can deliver on while not significantly over under committing. And there are lots of those segments that are sort of value add where you have to have long-term customer relationships where there is a certain amount of trust and I think from Micron\u2019s perspective that\u2019s actually an advantage for us. ","Our customers like us, they want us to succeed, we have a long-term history of meeting our commitments. And so I think in this kind of environment that actually plays out pretty well for us.","Some of the specific segments that are value add that are pretty important thing like graphics, we grew our graphics business pretty substantially this year. In many cases those are sole source relationships or two sources at most and a significant piece of the customers end products. And so those types or relationships I think are flagships for that kind of thought process. ","Automobile also I think is another one where Micron has very significant market share deep relationships with the customers and a trust that we are going to be there for them with the right products as markets tighten up.","Steven Fox","That\u2019s really helpful. And then just quick clarification, so on Inotera understand you don\u2019t want to go too much deeper into the number, but in terms of some of the synergies that are potentially ahead of you with Inotera should we just think a bit more as the flexibility to manage bits a little bit more efficiently or is there should we consider that there could be some meaningful cost savings that could come through for the margin down the road? Thanks.","Ernie Maddock","This is Ernie. I think the best way to think about is what Mark articulated earlier which is the cost synergies are relatively small the real opportunity will be as we align the manufacturing capability fully to the best of Micron fabs and that will provide more incremental opportunity to us and the cost savings piece.","Steven Fox","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Danely of Citi Group. Your line is open.","Chris Danely","Thanks guys. Quick question on mobile end market, you talked about China is being a big driver there, can you give us any sense of how big China is as far as your mobile demand or how big of the increase it was sequentially?","Mark Durcan","We have pretty good growth obviously in all geographies and with a lot of I think customers with the mobile business doubling. Some of that was with was with the market leaders but a lot of it was also was in China. So, e-MCP have been a great business for us, lot of that is in the Chinese value handsets and I don\u2019t think we want to get specific in terms of percentages but I think it\u2019s fair to say that we had strong growth in China as well as some of the high end smartphone manufacturers.","Chris Danely","Great. And then second question on another end market PCs, so again we all read the same stuff you do about shortages in DRAM in the PC end market, would you say that that is the end market where supply is tightest and any estimate of when these lead times could be or these extending lead times could be relieved?","Mark Durcan","Yeah, I would say it\u2019s tight there but product is moving around. Right, the industry is not static and what tends to happen as the market tightens up like this is people will sacrifice a little bit short term margin to move into segments that they believe are longer-term more advantaged. And so there is a little bit of that going on right now where perhaps margins might actually be a little higher in PCs, but people may shift production into servers because it\u2019s viewed as potentially longer term more favorable or noble because its maybe slightly more defendable market share as things change over time.","Chris Danely","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Good afternoon guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Mark, I guess my first question is just around sort of your DRAM profitably versus peers, I mean absolutely clearly DRAM is getting better, but there is still there is gap between the peers, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the 1x transaction for you, it seems like there is two vectors where you might be able to close that gap. ","One, it just seems like a better shrink for you than maybe your peers and; two, correct me if I am wrong, but most of Rexchip I believe is still a 25 nanometers. So it might seem to me that as you guys move to 1x you will have a big bigger wafer start base at 1x than you had at 20 nanometers, am I thinking about that the right way or how are you thinking about it?","Mark Durcan","First of at a level we're going to continue to outgrow the market in terms of bits like we talked about. And we're reducing cost at a faster rate than we have over the last three years. So that gap will continue to narrow with the forecast we've given you. Specifically relative to 110 series, yes it's a good shrink we have as I mentioned we've got a number of different products coming some of them are bigger shrink than others. ","And we\u2019re particularly excited about some of the ones that come later in the fiscal year that really drive out at a lot of costs in die size as appose to some of the ones that come earlier and fill value added potential segments or specific power or performance attributes that the customers are looking for.","Beyond that I think it's fair to say that we should get good bank for the buck on this technology transition not only because it's a substantial shrink, but also because a chunk of it the large chunk of it\u2019s happening in Taichung so we're actually transitioning capacity from 25 nanometer all the way down to 1x. So it's as we did with 20 nanometer in Hiroshima and in Inotera and a big chunk of that capacity at Inotera was doubled half from 30 nanometer to 20 nanometer. This will be a double half from 25 to 1x at the Taichung fab. And so there is a pretty good bank for the buck there. ","John Pitzer","That's helpful. And guys as my follow up you're still endorsing the two year CAGR for bit growth in NAND and DRAM for you. Ernie I know you don't want to get into quarter-by-quarter but I'm kind of curious as how we should think about linearity of that bit growth from here on out for this fiscal year for both DRAM and NAND. ","And I kind of ask the question because specifically for DRAM if it's kind of the linear growth rate it just seems like the February numbers are still embedding some very conservative assumptions around pricing given how good the environment is. So how do I think about that dynamics?","Ernie Maddock","I think you're going to see us make some steady quarter-on-quarter growth. But I don't think in DRAM particularly you're going to see it continued at the levels that you\u2019ve seen it for the last couple of quarters. And I think the best guidance we can provide is that we're going to be roughly year-on-year to get to our targets, we're going to need to be at or slightly above 50% in terms of bit growth year-on-year. I mean we've just given you a pretty big number for Q1. So that math is getting easier and easier to work out.","I would also tell you relative to some of the pricing, you will note that we widened our revenue guidance range a little bit and that's reflective of a bigger business and the fact that we realized pricing environment continues to be dynamic. So we did try to reflect our best thinking in the guidance that we've provided to you.","John Pitzer","Perfect, thanks guys. And congratulations on the strong results. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jagadish Iyer of Summit Redstone. Your question please. ","Jagadish Iyer","Yes thanks so much for taking my question. So first question Mark or Ernie how should we think about cost reduction for Gen Two NAND versus your Gen One? And when do you think it might become visible for you guys?","Mark Durcan","Yeah well, on full conversion I think of it as roughly doubling the bits for wafer and think of a cost down in the range of greater than 30%. So it's a big transition, but it's also as we mentioned will start to become significant until later in fiscal 2017.","Mark Durcan","Okay. And then on the DRAM front, I just wanted to find out if there is going to be any meaningful wafer capacity additions for Micron in fiscal '17. Is there a fab where you have some additional headroom for you to invest or should you invest in new greenfield? Thank you.","Mark Durcan","We're very focused on the technology upgrades that we were talking about with John a minute ago. That's where we have the biggest bank for the buck. We do have some clean room space around the network, but we have no plans to add new wafers this year.","Jagadish Iyer","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon guys and solid job on the quarterly execution and also congrats on the 600 basis point inflection in NAND gross margins. If we focus on this clearly 3D bit crossover was a big driver going forward, as I think about more cost per bit decline. Do you still have the benefits of continued higher 3D mix higher TLC 3D mix on Gen One. Question here is when should we expect TLC 3D crossover with 3D MLC. Is that going to be this quarter?","Mark Durcan","Yeah it definitely will be in this quarter in aggregate we expect TLC to be greater than 50% of the 3D bits.","Harlan Sur","Great, thanks for that. And then at the product level based off of third party estimates the enterprise SSD market is about a $10 billion market growing at about 25% year-over-year for the next few years, you guys have low single-digits market share while your JV partner has about 35% market share here high capacity status the biggest portion of this market you just announced the 5100 series that\u2019s 3D TLC. ","Can you guys just give us a sense on when you\u2019re going to start shipping this in volume production are the large hyper scale guys that\u2019ll be customers here? And just given what looks to be a step up in the roadmaps and maybe some of your customer feedback, do you guys anticipating growing your share here in the enterprise space in 2017?","Mark Durcan","Yes, we are definitely plan to grow our share. As you point out the fact that our share is relatively small in those segments today means there is a lot of opportunity, we do have what we think is a much better product portfolio analysis there\u2019s a lot of customer excitement and eagerness. And we think that we\u2019re well positioned with long-term customers who really want to buy from Micron. So yes.","Harlan Sur","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open. ","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you. I just wanted to ask a question about gross margin that the guidance is much better than expected. I am just -- I am curious how would you suggest we think about the gross margin potential of Micron considering your mix cost roadmap and whatever price -- base line pricing assumptions you\u2019re making is last cycles your peak gross margins sort of a good guide post for us or are you thinking about it differently?","Ernie Maddock","Well that\u2019s a question that got a thousand relative comparisons in it and what I would tell you is look we are a different company than in the last peak we have a higher mix of NAND, where we have a technology progression that we\u2019ve tried to share with you. So certainly I think we have outlined our cost reductions over the next three quarters or so. ","If you take the broad guidance we have provided, we\u2019ve provided bit growth targets and you get to overlay of pricing environments and from that drive a gross margin profile. But I would expect if you have a similar market you\u2019re going to continue to see opportunity for us to expand our gross margins. ","Romit Shah","Okay, thanks Ernie. And then can I also ask you, what\u2019s the net operating -- the NOL balance today? And can you just educate us on restriction in terms of utilizing net asset against future tax progressions?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, it\u2019s somewhere in the $4 billion plus or minus range and one of the reasons that -- and we\u2019re very focused on protecting that NOL, which is the reason we put our NOL rights plan in place and it\u2019s in the proxy now and up for shareholder review as well. And we intend to do everything we can do to continue to preserve our ability to use that because these are exactly the times that we want to have the ability to do that.","Romit Shah","Is it a $4 billion balance mean that whatever the tax rate is 5% is sort of the right way to think about your rate over the next several years.","Ernie Maddock","No because that would apply to you I think common earnings which are tax unfortunately to much higher rates than 5%.","Romit Shah","Okay, so you can only utilize it for U.S. income.","Ernie Maddock","That\u2019s right. ","Romit Shah","Okay, got it. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","David Wong","Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of what you expect your debt and cash and equivalents might be at the end of the February quarter for along the Inotera payments? And apart from CapEx are there any significant post acquisition cash charges for restructuring or anything else to do with Inotera?","Ernie Maddock","So there are no significant restructuring charges anticipated. We borrow $2.5 billion relative to Inotera, so we would expect that to be somewhere -- total debt to be somewhere in the range of $12 billion, high $12 billion maybe $13 billion plus or minus there is a few little moving pieces around. ","We are sitting here with cash this quarter at $4.3 billion there was a cash components of the transaction of about $500 million. And then we\u2019ll generate operating cash flow and free cash flow in fiscal Q2 which we don't guide. So the result of that will be sort of where we\u2019ll be at cash, but I would expect based on everything I know that it's reasonable to think flat or higher.","David Wong","Great, thanks very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy of Stifel. Your question please. ","Kevin Cassidy","Thank you. On your transition to the 1X DRAM process, will this be any different than past transitions? Meaning are you going to be coming out into the PC market first and then mobile or will these be targeted for certain markets.","Mark Durcan","We've got as I mentioned earlier Kevin we've got a broad spectrum of products. We're trying to make sure we get as many of them qualified early in the ramp as possible this time and do a slightly better job than we did at 20 nanometer. So actually we have sort of mobile and compute products coming and then we have sort of additional cost reduced and broader market applications behind that.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay great. And on your 3D cross point, you said that you'd have your first revenue in 2017. Can you state what end market that would be?","Mark Durcan","Sorry, can you repeat the question Kevin?","Kevin Cassidy","3D cross point, what's your first end market for that?","Mark Durcan","We're talking to a number of different customers and we probably don't want to say yet.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, congratulations on the great results and guidance. ","Mark Durcan","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your line is open. ","Mark Newman","Hi, thanks and congrats on a great quarter. Question really about where we are in the cycle right now. Things look really great on pricing. I wonder and as also you mentioned inventory on the DRAM maintenance level also looks good. Do you have any comments on the inventory of the customers? ","I'm wondering particularly on the Chinese smartphone OEMs have been buying quite a lot of memory through this second half of 2016. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing any double ordering any excess inventory on the customer side. Anything at all that makes you a little bit concerned of excess inventory either on the chip side or on the finished product side on especially on handsets?","Mark Durcan","Not really Mark. We've heard rumors along the lines of those that you're alluding to I believe. But we can't -- I can't validate those for you. Certainly in most market segments it's very, very tight. And anytime you have that and customers starting to get nervous about are they potentially getting a wind down et cetera. You always start to be concerned that people are just trying to get a little bit ahead of it build some inventory, I think that's only natural. I think we're doing a pretty good job of trying to allocate this product where it's absolutely most needed. And so I don't think too many people are building up too much inventory.","Mark Newman","Great thanks. And if you think back to the previous back in 2014 at the moment this feels very much like 2014 pricing strong, demand is good, supply demand movement is pretty tight. Anything different if you compare between now and then because now clearly what happened in 2015-16 wasn't quite what we were hoping for in terms of supply demand balance in pricing. ","I was just wondering if you had any comments on what is different between the previous cycle? Clearly the industry is a lot better than the past, but the question is how much? And I'm just trying to ask if you had any particular thoughts of this time versus 2014 in particular. ","Mark Durcan","Well I think that part of what happened in the last latter stages of the last cycle where perhaps a little bit a miscalculation by one of the suppliers, but that they probably learned from so there is that. The biggest change structurally in the market though really is the fact that the products are going in a much broader set of end markets are much more broadly distributed now we\u2019re three or four years on from where we were in the last cycle. And I think it does make a difference.","Mark Newman","Thanks very much.","Ernie Maddock","Mark I\u2019ll add one more piece to that, which is sort of a long-term trend that we\u2019ve talked about in the past in terms of slowing technology migrations, means that the competitors in the marketplace are likely doing math with numbers that are changing less rapidly than they used to be. So both from a demand and a supply perspective as those numbers get smaller and the slope gets smaller and a rate of change it gets a little bit easier to do the math and keep things in balance.","And then finally you layer on what\u2019s going on with NAND right now from a demand perspective, just explosive I think is probably the right word in terms of demand and elastic as well. And so I think there is maybe some insulation there that wasn\u2019t there last time around. ","Mark Newman","Great, thanks very much.","Ivan Donaldson","Operator we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes sir, our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your question please. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Ida [ph] calling in for C.J. question. Another questions on XPoint, can you talk about whether you see that product impacting DRAM demand down the road?","Mark Durcan","A question on export, is that. Not early no, the question was asked who we are ship to first, we are not tell you who we are going to ship to first, but longer term it\u2019s storage, it\u2019s datacenter and it\u2019s mobile applications all of those. I think early on it\u2019s pure additive demand from the overall memory market. So we get two or three years in and have more substantial ramp going on the cost reduction. Yes I think it will overtime cannibalize part of the DRAM business.","Unidentified Analyst","And second question, in terms of the NAND channel inventory, who is that looking right now?","Mark Durcan","Very tight, very tight, customers are quite concerned. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. ","Ivan Donaldson","Thank you everyone. This now concludes Micron Technology\u2019s first quarter 2017 financial release conference call.

Bedard","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Durcan. Mark?","D. Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to start today with a brief overview of the key developments during the quarter and an update on the proposed Elpida acquisition, followed by a recap of fiscal 2012 and our focus heading into 2013. After that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary, and we'll close our comments with Mark Adams discussing key developments in our business unit and operations, as well as an update on market condition.","Revenue in the quarter was down about 10%, primarily due to a reduction in DRAM bits. You may recall that we had forecast in our previous earnings call that this would be occurring as we transition significant production to more forward gigabit densities. Also impacting this comparison was a significant reduction in inventory for both DRAM and NAND that occurred in our fiscal Q3.","Gross margins were pretty flat quarter-over-quarter, with improvements in NAND and NOR and offsetting reductions in DRAM. From a market perspective, NAND flash demand improved during the quarter. And this, coupled with muted industry supply, led to improve ASPs compared to the quarter-to-date estimate we gave you in late June.","On the other hand, DRAM market prices deteriorated during the quarter, primarily related to weakness in the PC environment, although our net DRAM ASP, A-S-P, was essentially flat due to mix improvements. NOR revenue remains stable in the quarter, and we're pleased to see NOR gross margins improved by about 5 percentage points, mostly due to cost reductions.  Total inventory was down again in fiscal Q4. We're continuing to focus on improving our turns over the next several quarters.","In DRAM, 30-nanometer yields are on track, and we should see a nice jump in production and cost improvements over the next few quarters. From a NAND perspective, we had the first full quarter of results following the restructure of our supply and technology agreement with Intel in April. All product coming out of IMFS in Singapore and our Virginia fab now flow to Micron. As a result, we have a much larger base in wafer capacity in our trade NAND trade business, targeting key gross segments including SSDs, smartphones and tablets.","Although we would have preferred to be reporting better financial results for fiscal 2012 today, looking back, we had some significant highlights in the year. We achieved increased manufacturing scale and performance as we completed our volume manufacturing ramp of our world-class flash memory facility in Singapore on both 25- and 20-nanometer technology and transitioned Micron's DRAM operations to 30-nanometer DRAM manufacturing.","We launched the Hybrid Memory Cube product line, reinforcing our leadership in high performance DRAM technology. We completed the successful implementation of our new global supply chain management system. We achieved a successful outcome in the Rambus antitrust trial. We redefined and expanded our joint venture with Intel. We signed a sponsorship agreement to merge Elpida's operations into Micron and which, upon close, will place Micron as the industry's leading memory pure play and one of the top 5 semiconductor companies in the world.","Relative to Elpida, let me elaborate on a few of the items and update you on the timeline to close. The Japanese court and Elpida trustees ran a rigorous and thorough sponsors selection process and determine Micron's sponsorship proposal to be the most attractive alternative. We believe the proposed agreement represents the best solution for Elpida's debtholders, employees, customers and the Japanese semiconductor and electronics industries.","For Micron, the deal will provide greater manufacturing and R&D scale, as well as a significant product, customer and cost synergy, all at attractive economics for Micron shareholders. The combined company will be well positioned to grow and thrive, optimizing a potential return for all involved.","The financial terms and expected timeline to close have not changed since our announcement in July. On September 11, the U.S. HSR waiting period expired, and depending on the timeline for other government approvals, we still expect to close some time in the first half of 2013.","Entering fiscal 2013, we are focused on driving our return to profitability with a continued emphasis on cash flow. We do face some headwinds from the macro environment and from the demand profile in a number of segments. Specific to DRAM, prices are currently soft. While certain amounts of supply has come offline, we still need to see improvement in demand in the market to get things back on track. The upcoming Windows 8 launch and proliferation of DRAM in mobile devices should help get the ball rolling. Although it's hard for us to predict the timing of our recovery, Mark Adams will comment later on this.","NAND market prices are currently up quarter-to-date, following the nice ASP recovery over the summer and we don't see any disruptive supply coming online in the near future. We expect strong demand for SSDs and ultrathins in enterprise servers and storage, as well as the proliferation of smartphones and tablets to fuel significant NAND consumption.","From an operational standpoint, we continue to drive manufacturing cost reductions and optimize our product mix, focused on the best margin and growth opportunities. We also intend to be very disciplined in our spending profile, both in terms of overhead and CapEx and manage our inventory levels carefully.","I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.","Ronald C. Foster","Thanks, Mark. Our 2012 fiscal year ended on August 30. On our website, we have provided a schedule containing certain key results for the fourth quarter, as well as certain guidance for the next quarter. That material is also presented on a few slides that follow.","First, the fiscal 2012, it ended in a net loss of just over $1 billion or $1.04 per share on net sales of $8.2 billion. Fiscal 2011 comparatively showed roughly breakeven net income on sales of $8.8 billion. Total sales for 2012 decreased about 6% compared to the prior year as a result of the generally severe price pressure in the memory industry as a whole. DRAM sales for 2012 reflect a 12% decrease compared to 2011, the product of a 59% increase in DRAM bit sales, offset by a 45% decrease in average selling prices.","Bit sales in the premium DRAM sectors increased 62% in 2012 compared to 2011. Trade NAND sales grew 19%, the product of bit sales over 2.5x the 2011 level, offset by a 55% decrease in selling prices. Trade NAND sales were favorably affected by the higher mix of Micron SSDs in 2012, which comprised 14% of trade NAND sales for the year. Sales of NOR products decreased year-over-year in line with the general decline in market demand and the performance of our customer base in particular.","On the cost side, DRAM bit cost in 2012 decreased 32% compared to the prior year, roughly consistent with the long-term industry trend. NAND bit cost over the past year decreased 45% compared to the prior year as we leverage our industry-leading process technology. Broadly, annual sales for 2012 were comprised of about 44% NAND, 39% DRAM and 12% NOR.","Turning now to the fourth quarter results. We posted a net loss of $243 million or $0.24 per share on net sales of $2 billion. These quarterly results compare to a net loss of $320 million or $0.32 per share on net sales of $2.2 billion for the third quarter.","Fourth quarter revenue was sequentially lower in total, as well as for both DRAM and NAND on generally flat pricing for DRAM products and slightly lower pricing for NAND products. Although DRAM pricing was generally down in the fourth quarter, as Mark mentioned, improved mix in our premium segments yielded an overall flat average selling price. Both DRAM and NAND saw lower volumes of bit sales. As a result, when combined with stable bit cost for both DRAM and NAND across the 2 quarters and at better NOR margin performance, consolidated gross margin was fairly stable for the third quarter in a row.","Depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter was $509 million. This decrease, compared to recent historical periods, is due to certain production equipment primarily in the Lehigh and Virginia NAND and 200-millimeter NOR operations that have become fully depreciated. We anticipate depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2013.","As a result of the changes to the IM Flash joint venture with Intel that occurred in the third quarter, NAND sales to Intel decreased by half in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous projections. That volume has now shifted to trade NAND going forward. However, trade NAND bit volume growth for Q4, although consistent with our projection, did not reflect the magnitude of this shift for 2 reasons. First, onetime WIP sales to Intel, which were part of the IM Flash transaction, masked the normal Q3 to Q4 growth rate. And second, some production volume went back into WIP as we refilled the manufacturing pipeline with Micron trade products, so you can better ascertain the underlying growth rate by comparing trade bit growth from Q2 to Q4, which grew 78% over that period.","A higher volume of SSD sales in the fourth quarter mitigated the decrease in trade NAND selling prices compared to the third quarter. Price decreases for NAND components enabled increased penetration into the client SSD space. Sales of enterprise SSDs were also up nicely albeit on a lower base. Trade NAND selling prices are up a couple percent quarter-to-date, while trade NAND cost per bit is expected to be down a few percent in the first quarter. Trade NAND bit growth is projected to be flat in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter as we transition to new technology nodes.","DRAM revenue on the fourth quarter decreased 9% compared to the previous quarter as a result of a 9% decrease in bit sales volume, consistent with our prior guidance, due to a mix shift to lower density specialty DRAM, as well as initially lower yields on our new 4-gig DDR3 RAM. Selling prices for specialty DRAM products improved slightly in the fourth quarter, while prices in the PC sector dropped significantly due to weakness in demand. Quarter-to-date, selling prices are down on the high teens when compared to the Q4 average.","DRAM cost per bit declined slightly quarter-to-quarter, and we are forecasting bit cost for DRAM in the first quarter to be down in the high single-digit range as we continue to transition to our 4-gig DDR3 product. This transition is also driving bit production up low- to mid-teens in the first quarter.","NOR sales increased slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and represented 12% of total revenue for Q4. NOR revenue in the first quarter is expected to be in the same range as the fourth quarter. We anticipate NOR cost reductions will continue to outpace selling price reductions in the first quarter.","Turning now to business units. The NAND Solutions Group revenue declined from the third quarter due to the onetime impact of selling back-end inventory to Intel during the third quarter that I mentioned earlier. Trade NAND sales and NSG were up in the fourth quarter on increased volume and stable average selling prices. NSG was able to achieve positive operating income from the third quarter level on improved product mix sold in the fourth quarter, including a 67% increase in bits sold in SSD form, as well as lower cost base sales to Intel.","Operating income from the DRAM Solutions Group in the fourth quarter primarily reflects the lower DRAM revenue trends I commented on earlier. DSG sales into the personal system sector decreased as we move volumes into higher-margin areas, notably networking, as pricing in the personal systems came under additional pricing pressure, particularly in the latter part of our fourth quarter. DRAM sales into the personal systems market were just 14% of total sales in our fourth quarter.","Our Wireless Solutions Group performance continues to reflect weakness of the feature phone market segment and our customer group, in particular. Revenue declined for the third quarter, primarily due to lower NAND sales, as we transitioned to new products and configuration and as customers worked through existing inventory. Wireless DRAM and NAND declined ahead of product transitions, while wireless NOR sales remain steady quarter-to-quarter.","The Embedded Solutions Group results continue to reflect growth, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors. In fact, in the fourth quarter, ESG reported its highest revenue levels since the establishment of our business unit. The revenue growth came from the broad strength across the technology portfolio as NOR, NAND and DRAM revenue increased from the third quarter.","In addition to the top line growth, ESG operating income strengthened as the fourth quarter results included better cost performance than the previous quarter and improved factory utilization.","In operating expenses, SG&A expense in the fourth quarter was slightly below our projected range as a result of lower costs associated with pending legal matters and lower personnel costs from our variable pay plans. We expect SG&A expense to be between $135 million and $145 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","Fourth quarter expense for R&D was right at the high end of our guided range. These expenses vary primarily due to the volume of development wafers processed and the timing of the product quals. R&D expense in the first quarter is expected to be between $220 million and $230 million.","The company generated $450 million in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter. Comparing operating cash flows in the third quarter to the fourth quarter, the IM Flash restructure transaction had a favorable impact on Q3 from the $300 million deposit received from Intel in the third quarter, while the fourth quarter operating cash flow was negatively impacted by $45 million of product sales, invoices charged to that deposit. We ended the fiscal year with a cash and investments balance of $2.9 billion. This balance increased $718 million compared to the previous yearend, as we generate $2.1 billion of cash from operations, raised $1.5 billion net new financing and spent $1.9 billion in capital expenditures.","Inventory declined $82 million quarter-to-quarter, where finished goods reductions more than offset the WIP increase related to refilling the back-end pipeline after the Intel transaction. We expect expenditures from property plant and equipment for fiscal 2013 to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, slightly weighted toward the earlier part of the fiscal year.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. Mark?","Mark W. Adams","Thanks, Ron. Today, I'm going to walk through some of our fourth quarter operational highlights, as well as discuss the current market dynamics in memory business. Our NAND Solutions Group recovered from a weak ASP environment in the beginning of the quarter. If you recall, ASPs were down mid-teens this quarter-to-date during the first few weeks of our Q4. Prices recovered during the quarter, and the trade NAND business ended up with slight revenue growth and stable gross margins. In addition, finished goods inventory declined quarter-over-quarter.","Micron SSD revenue was up 33% in the quarter with unit shipments up over 50%. We're seeing steady growth of our client SSDs at key OEM partners and continued growth of Crucial blended SSD drives in the channel. Where other channel competitors have struggled to generate a profit, Crucial continues to drive solid financial performance. We are now shipping client SSDs to 5 of the top OEMs in the world and plans to grow our share in the coming year. Client SSD revenue was up close to 30% in Q4. For fiscal year '12, unit shipments more than doubled. Also, part of our growing client portfolio is our new mSATA SSD, which was selected as Best of Show Award winner at this year's Flash Memory Summit as the Most Innovative Flash Consumer Application.","On the enterprise side, our SATA drives, the P300 and P400e, continue to be the lead drives for us this quarter in terms of shipments. We also maintained steady progress in qualifying our PCIe drives with leading OEM customers and are now gaining traction to our distribution channels as well.","In Q4, Enterprise SSD revenue was up over 50% albeit off of a relatively low base. We're gearing up for some new products this fall, including our enterprise grade SATA drive and our first SAS drive. Both drives are involved in casing now with OEMs.","Unique features we provide with these new products showcase our silicon to system strategy including the firmware and hardware management schemes that are only available from a Micron-integrated SSD. Another example of our growing system capability is the acquisition of Virtensys this fiscal year, which had provided Micron with a virtualized appliance.","In combination with our P320 PCIe cards, it provides much more storage in the appliance versus mobile server storage, and when we hook these up via PCIe interconnects, you can share the storage across an enterprise environment.","We've also made significant strides in the quarter and in the fiscal year with our internal controller development. Our controller strategy is really 2-pronged, using both internal and externally-designed controllers. We're focused at the high end of our system solution for our internally design controllers. However, our approach is modularized and can be scaled down to the lower-end client systems over time.","On a NAND technology operation front, we continue to be pleased with 20-nanometer ramp and expect production crossover in the first half of calendar year 2013. MLC represented about 75% to 80% of our wafer production in Q4, with SLC and TLC essentially splitting the remainder. Although fiscal Q1 will only see a small reduction in trade NAND cost per bit, we expect to average down mid to high-single digits over the next several quarters, mostly related to the 20-nanometer execution.","As I mentioned earlier, following a tough first half of the calendar year, NAND prices started to recover over the summer, and we have seen continued improvements in market prices subsequent to our quarter end. In terms of NAND inventory, we see the channel balanced about 3 weeks. We are excited about the drivers for NAND, including SSDs, tablets and smartphones and believe the industry bit demand compounded over annually 50% [ph] from 2012 through 2016. In 2013, NSG bit supply forecast are up in the low 50% [ph] range, well below historical levels. We continue to see balance between our current capacity and serving our customer needs.","Our DRAM Solutions Group achieved record shipments in networking, storage, graphics and consumer segments this quarter. On the server side, we increased market share with existing customers and won [ph] critical qualification slot that our new customers are [ph] in the high-growth data center markets. We did, however, see some price pressure in the server market as OEMs compete for this growth-oriented data center business. Nonetheless, this server-growing market segment share is helping to drive DRAM bit demand over 50% year-over-year.","The networking segment had another strong quarter, exceeding targets for revenue, bit growth and gross margin. In terms of demand in the segment, LTE adoption is progressing well. While the Americas and Japan have strong investments in the infrastructure, so does -- China will continue to grow despite some weakness showing in the European market segments.","During Q4, we have seen softness in PC demand, although we were able -- still able to maintain minimal ASP declines in the quarter. That being said, we are seeing price weakness in Q1 and see short-term challenges with channel inventory overhang and OEM customers remaining generally cautious. The demand catalyst for improvement in the PC DRAM segment include the upcoming Windows 8 launch, with both Intel and ARM-based products expected in key OEMs, in particular, with the Ultrathin category.","From a technology perspective, our 30-nanometer process nodes saw volume ramp in fiscal Q4 with qualifications across the broad customer base. The timing of our 4-gigabyte transition actually limited our output in fiscal Q4, but we expect to catch up this quarter, which, coupled, with the 30-nanometer technologies, providing significant bit growth and cost reductions.","Another key aspect of our cost per bit and output improvement over the next couple of quarters is Inotera's execution. In fiscal Q4, they took steps to remove a production bottleneck during what was a slow demand period. Moving forward, the throughput and percentage of wafers on leading-edge technologies from Inotera will improve.","In aggregate, we expect crossover output on 30-nanometer in the current quarter, putting us in a much stronger competitive position. We are also progressing with a 30-nanometer design strength [ph] , which will give us additional cost reductions over the next couple of quarters. Our 20-nanometer process node will commence in calendar year 2013.","All in all, we see quarterly cost per bit reductions averaging mid- to high-single digits over the next several quarters. DRAM market prices were generally stable coming into the quarter, although things began to weaken in July and we're seeing that trend continue as we head into fiscal year 2013. In terms of DRAM inventory, we believe that the channel is currently running about 6 to 8 weeks on average. Some of the short term weakness in PC DRAM seem attributable to a pause prior to the Windows 8 launch. We anticipate things will improve with the new OS and in combination with Ultrathin form factors, although timing is difficult to predict.","Outside of PC, we're generally pleased with DRAM demand, with several segments driving bit demand well over 40% year-over-year. That said, continued mild or even lower industry supply bit growth might be the required catalyst to get DRAM ASPs back to profitable levels in the future. Current industry bit forecasts are high 20s -- or 20% for 2012 and similar for 2013 although there's no certain possibility of further supply or CapEx cuts in the industry given current ASP weakness.","Revenues in our Wireless Solutions Group declined with both DRAM and NAND as we continued [ph] to work on aligning our product portfolios to customer demand. NOR sales stabilized and were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. As we rebuild our wireless business, we remain focused on profitability. Despite the top line revenue decline, we see better operating performance in WSG, which will be our focus when we prepare for a combination with Elpida's wireless business.","Fiscal Q4 saw the introduction and rapid growth with the smartphone open market in China. This is expected to represent the majority of the rapidly growing Chinese smartphone market, which is forecasted to grow from 50 units -- 50 million units in 2011 to 600 million units in 2014 due to the rapid transition from feature phones to smartphones. During fiscal Q4, this emerging market adversely affected our wireless revenue due to abrupt NAND MCP density changes. However, in the long run, we anticipate this modest growth to be a huge opportunity for Micron due to our future portfolio alignment.","One example is the ramp-up of our 4-gigabit low-power DDR2 mobile DRAM, which is growing in present significantly in a portion of the market. We're also excited to announce the official qualification of our 1-gigabit phase change memory-based MCP product with 2 key mobile customers. We expect volume shipments to commence in fiscal 2013.","I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Mike Rayfield, who recently joined Micron as our new Vice President of the Wireless Solutions Group. Mike has an impressive background in the wireless business. I know he is excited to hit the ground running and help position this segment for growth and profitability in the future.","Our Embedded Solutions Group had another solid performance with record revenue in gross margins driven by strong quarter-over-quarter shipment growth in DRAM, NAND and NOR and across all regions outside of Europe. We have strong design wins across all technologies and clearly strengthened the networking in automotive sectors during the second half of the year. In automotive, where we are now ramping the MMC products for the segment, which is expected to drive significant revenue in fiscal 2013.","We've also completed qualification on over 150 platforms at 60-chipset partners during the last year. These qualifications span all segments with particular strength in consumer networking, ensuring that Micron embedded memory solutions were supported and pre-validated with chipset solutions to enable our customers fastest time in the market. We are leading the NOR industry from a manufacturing and technology perspective with 45-nanometer now ramping in mass volume on 200 millimeter and then the recent introduction of 45-nanometer, 300-millimeter NOR in our Virginia fab.","Moving into 2013, we will continue to focus on growing our share in key embedded segments leveraging our product portfolio, technology leadership and manufacturing scale. Our operational performance in fiscal 2013 is to continue the deployment of advanced technology, which I described earlier in the business units discussion, as well as improved cost efficiency in our fabs, optimize our inventory and enhance supply chain management. Our broad product portfolio extending scale and global manufacturing presence requires a greater focus on supply chain management.","The same goes for inventory management. We are tasking our business units and our sales teams to increase turns and quarterly sales linearity for high-volume products, while we're also ensuring we have the right levels of strategic inventory for premium margin-specific products.","While we have experienced ultimate market conditions over the last 12 months, we are optimistic that we can see improved money market looking out over the next 12 months. While DRAM prices have indeed weakened, we have seen a nice recovery in NAND ASPs and our overall NAND demand while we're benefiting from slower industry supply. Our NOR margins improved in Q4 and this business continues to generate substantial free cash flow. We remain focused on optimizing our product portfolio, as well as leveraging our technology leadership and manufacturing efficiency to enhance our financial performance in 2013.","Now I'll turn it back -- the call back over to Kipp.","Kipp A. Bedard","Thank you, Mark. We will now like to take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first of all, on the NAND side, I think you referred to some industry bit growth estimates for 2013 in the low 50% range. I was wondering, based on what you see today, do you think we're going to end up for the industry on the high or low end side of that? And where do you expect Micron to come in, in terms of that industry bit growth, higher or lower?","D. Mark Durcan","I think the answer to your question is probably both on the low end, both the industry and Micron.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then could you maybe talk about in the Wireless Solutions Group what are the steps you're going to take to start turning around the profitability in that segment? I think you obviously referred to improving gross margins in the NOR Flash space. But can you talk to maybe some of the actions you might look to take, either operationally or in terms of pulling apart portfolio there?","D. Mark Durcan","Sure. I think it's important to note that the business -- our wireless business has evolved from both the acquisition of Numonyx and kind of where this segment was. And then we had a pretty high heavily concentrated business in the feature phone market. We're -- we've been moving our product development efforts, as well as product roadmaps towards the smartphone piece of the business and our advancement in terms of low-power DRAM will allow us to get more aligned with the broader demand cycles in the mobile phone market. So I think from a product perspective, we're well aligned going forward. We also have, in taking a look at our spending across NAND, DRAM and NOR, to make sure we're focused on these future products and making some test choices on some of the existing or historical legacy products that have not generated profit. So between the expenditure side and some product alignment and, of course, our new leadership, we feel pretty good about the business going forward.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And the last question for me will be, I think you gave a number in terms of the SSD sales for fiscal '12. Do you care to make any kind of guess about what that number could be like on a -- or your basis for 2013?","D. Mark Durcan","You know us, James, we try not to predict anything like that or forecast it, but nice try.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first one on the DRAM side, can you talk about what you're seeing there in terms of utilization rate, particularly from the Tier 2 guys? Are you starting to see them ratchet back or they're still lingering?","D. Mark Durcan","Really, we just read the same stuff in the press that you guys do, and it's hard for us to comment beyond that sort of speculation.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I guess, thinking a little bit longer term, can you share with us what the mix was, PC, server mobility, et cetera, in August? And where you think that could move to 12 months from now and how we should think about the implications to gross margins for that business?","D. Mark Durcan","Sure. On a revenue basis, we were exposed to the personal systems by about 15%. This is of total revenues, had a pretty strong server business, low double digits; networking and storage, mid-teens; mobile, low-double digits; and then AIMM was around 10%.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And care to talk about where you see that going 12 years -- 12 months from now?","D. Mark Durcan","Can I just say just going to repeat my answer from the last question? It's really hard, especially we're talking revenues. You have to also predict not only your growth rate in bits, but also what ASPs are going to be doing, and that's just pretty difficult to determine.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure, very fair. And then last question for me on the NAND side. Can you walk through the roadmap there in 20-nanometer? When we should start to see -- you talked about, I guess, mid-to-high cost down each quarter. Will that commence in calendar Q1, Q2? How should we think about that?","D. Mark Durcan","Go ahead, Mark.","Mark W. Adams","I think the answer is we're really focused on hitting more of the production crossover towards the end of the first half of 2013. So then you'll see some of that costs flow through to our NAND costs. So today, we're shipping the product but expect to continued increased volumes that allow us to realize big cost savings.","D. Mark Durcan","If I can add, I can just refer you as well to your guidance sheet. You can see there for Q1 '13, we're suggesting down a few percent in NAND and then a more aggressive cost down over the next few quarters after that.","Operator","And we also have a question from the line of Daniel Amir from Lazard.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Can you a bit expand how you see kind of the PC market playing out in the next year given Windows 8, Ultrabooks, some of the change that you've done also to the DRAM franchise? And then I have one follow-up.","Mark W. Adams","Well, I think we commented earlier that, currently, we're in a soft PC DRAM market condition, and we do have some belief that between Windows 8 and a further enhanced delivery of ultrathin products from across the OEM base, can infuse some higher demand signals. It's hard to call. It doesn't seem like it's going to be in the real short term, but we think over the fiscal year, we see some balance there in terms of the markets, some recovery in the PC space. But that's really those 2 demand drivers offset, obviously, by smartphone and tablet growth and how that impacts the overall long-term piece of the business.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of -- how should we look at kind of the best guess would be on cost-downs in the DRAM space here in the next year? I don't know how much you want to comment on potential Elpida, but maybe without Elpida.","D. Mark Durcan","We're looking at around 30% to 40% on DRAM.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chin from UBS.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First one I had relates to your mobile DRAM products. I know it's still a relatively modest business for you currently. But referring from your perspective, what was the current average content for mobile DRAM in the smartphones that you guys have exposure to? And also, is your ability to produce mobile DRAM, is that going to be the -- is it the limiter to how big you guys can grow your MCP business?","D. Mark Durcan","Sure. I can start with the first part of that with the raw data, then maybe Mark can jump in with some of the spots around how the market's set a bit. Today, on average of all handsets, you're looking at about 315 megabytes per phone, average handset and about 3.5 gigabytes of NAND. In the smartphone segment itself, you're currently looking at smartphones in about the total 600, low 700 megabytes per handset and more in the low-30s to 40 -- low-30s gigabytes in NAND in the smartphone segment. The average megabytes per handset next year by third-party analysts are expected to grow again over 100% and NAND up around 50%.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And just looking at your solid-state drive business. Obviously, you do have a number of different products that are helping to expand portfolio, both on the client side and enterprise side. Care to take any guesses then as to what kind of margin profile the overall business will look like in a years' time, just given the different enterprise pieces, whether it's PCIe or the flash drive?","D. Mark Durcan","You guys are really making it easy for me to answer. I keep saying, sorry, too hard to predict.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. In terms of capital equipment reuse, can you remind us, given the latest generation of NAND, the lithography equipment that you have, what would be the smallest node that it can be reused on for DRAM?","D. Mark Durcan","This is Mark. There's really a lot of fungibility and we have really state-of-the-art lithography equipment in all our manufacturing fabs. Depending on the manufacturing technology we use, that equipment is generally fungible down to 15 nanometers on either technology.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In terms of your technology, you were talking about NAND transitions down to 20 nanometers. What's your visibility at the moment for future NAND transitions? And when do you expect to have to have EUV to keep progressing?","D. Mark Durcan","Well, we -- as I just mentioned, David, we can take the existing immersion -- high NA capacity on -- down to the 15-nanometer range. Obviously, we'd love to have a low-cost EUV solution available. If the manufacturing costs were there today, we'd use it today, but we can continue to migrate our technology without it, and we just continue to monitor that. We'll be adopters as soon as we see the return.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. And on Elpida, if I understand correctly, in addition to the regulatory agreement, you still need a final decision from the court for the deal to progress under the negotiated term. Is that correct? And if so, is there a deadline for when the court will make that determination?","D. Mark Durcan","We still see this deal closing the first half of 2013, and we see that the -- from our perspective, the bottleneck in that process is likely to be the regulatory approval. The court process will run its course, and we think that the regulatory approval will overlap or extend beyond the end of that process.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Goodman from the CLSA.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I have a question on the DRAM side of things. In the past, you've talked about specialty DRAM prices as trailing your commodity trends with lower highs and then higher loads, so sort of a smoother trend over time. But then if we look back over the past year, there really wasn't that boost early in the year in prices when commodity was doing well. Last quarter, it sounds like you've kind of tracked in line with flattish trends and then looking ahead, you're talking about down in the high teens. So I guess, how should we think about this business going forward relative -- how it will trend relative to the commodity trends?","Mark W. Adams","Well, I think that certainly there are certain segments that are experiencing significant growth but there's also new dynamics going on in the market segment, and I'm thinking specifically about server where we've seen tremendous application growth, but also on the low end of that segment, some level of commoditization with generic platforms and non-branded solutions where, even in the likes of Google, now being one of the largest server manufacturers in the world. So I think we're seeing pieces -- parts of that segment under some price pressure due to commoditization of it. But overall, we remain very bullish about the server business and I think it will be continue to behave as such. And the other side of that equation is that there wasn't really a big rebound as you might have suggested in the first half of the year. We didn't see that. It might have slowed, but it still -- DRAM didn't really have a recovery in such that it's just got a longer, prolonged pricing environment, especially the lag and now kind of in line with where it normally is.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on the NAND side of things. We've seen a kind of a reshuffling in the competitive landscape, at least on the custom embedded side of things where -- with some of the larger buyers out there have shifted their supplier base. Just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of how that impacted the opportunities you have? Has this opened up anything? Or are you seeing increased competition on fronts where you haven't in the past?","D. Mark Durcan","Really, Ryan, we haven't seen much of a change. The opportunities to increase our market share are available to us from various customers. And as we -- as Mark noted, we're excited to get our hands on additional trade NAND bits that we can go service these guys in a higher manner.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Market.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mark, you made a mention that you guys have the fungibility on the equipment front to go to lower nodes. How about transitioning from DRAM to NAND? And when I look at what's happening in the marketplace, it sounds like the NAND market is clearly in better space shape than the DRAM market, but yet your output is increasing fastest on the DRAM side. How do we reconcile that?","D. Mark Durcan","Well, Doug, I think that flexibility is definitely there and that's certainly something we have the ability to do as we migrate to future nodes. The opportunity to take DRAM capacity and move it to NAND is there. It's cost effective and efficient. It's not something you want to do with high frequency, but it is something you can do in Japan. Roadmaps in technology node transitions to efficiently take DRAM capacity and migrate it to NAND. And for that matter, it's the opposite of your thesis, but you can do it the other way around as well.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess my question is, really looking at next quarter, you're getting production up in DRAM faster in bit terms than your NAND side and I'm trying to understand why you're doing -- why you wouldn't have inverted that this quarter, given the condition in the marketplace.","D. Mark Durcan","Simple answer, Doug, it's just the timing of the strengths. We've got a real nice, steep ramp here on 30-nanometer DRAM in Q1. And our real steep ramp in NAND bits going to 20-nanometer really happened in Q2 and 3.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And I guess as sort of a follow-up, how should we think about the status of your inventory? And whether you -- inventory did come down a little bit this quarter. Is that the right level of inventory? And how should we think about your ability to model inventory for the next year, so to speak? Is there an opportunity to run your factories a little leaner so that there's higher turns? How should we think about that?","Mark W. Adams","Doug, as I commented in my opening discussion, we will continue to look at inventory. Over the last couple of quarters, I think the team has done a pretty good of job on that front. And then we also, as we take a look at some of these more system-level solutions, enterprise is a steeper example. It's -- when we take capacity from just selling raw components to building solutions-oriented products, it might limit some of the future reduction potential. But we will continue to look at it, and we feel pretty confident we are putting the right controls in place to make sure inventory stays at the appropriate level for the business.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And my last question for you, can you guys give us an update on new technologies? I mean, we talked at the last Analyst Day about a whole laundry list of potential candidates for the next generation technology. Where do we stand on that and mainly timeframe?","D. Mark Durcan","Well, we continue to make good progress on a number of different technologies targeted at really slightly different applications. Obviously, we're in volume manufacturing now on phase change. So I don't know if you count that as an emerging memory anymore because we really don't -- we count it as here today and going into volume applications in 2013. But beyond that, some of the ROE RAM technologies and other more advanced next-generation memories, we're making good progress on them. I don't see any of them having a significant impact in 2013 or really in 2014 with the possible exception of some volume on vertical NAND technologies, if you include those in that bucket.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","If I heard you right, you talked about what mobile DRAM in and being down in the mobile category. And I was wondering, is that a phenomenon of your customers working down inventory during what should otherwise be seasonal strength? Is it ASPs? Or is it simply your customer mix and maybe not having the best share positioning as we go into the holiday season?","Mark W. Adams","I think it's really the latter area. We're working ourselves through some customer concentration, customer mix issues that don't really reflect the larger in potential as we transition. But that's what's causing some of the impact to the financials.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","How long would it take you to maybe realign that customer concentration out? Can you -- what kind of window should we look forward to?","Mark W. Adams","I would just say this, without trying to predict too much in the future, Alex, I think that we've been working on this for some time. And remember, some of the product technology that we have that goes in that space, the value of commodity line of the wireless space, we can also use in other segments, namely embedded. So as we're focusing our customer engagement development efforts on some of the better pieces of the wireless business, we're able to use some of that capacity and drive ESG, for example, to higher -- their highest quarter since they've been formed as a BU. So I don't want to predict the future. I will just say that this is a known process that we're going through in the company that obviously, hasn't yet hit the financials but we're pretty encouraged by things like low-power DRAM and our 30-nanometer nodes and the uptick that we've seen in wireless, in addition to our longer-term prospects of a combined Micron and Elpida wireless business.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could ask, SSD seems to be performing pretty well but the DRAM, as it pertains to the PC industry, is struggling. How can you reconcile that? Is the SSD business experiencing some of the similar weakness in DRAM? Or has your share gain been so great that it masks it?","Mark W. Adams","I think when you look at SSDs, the client SSD business is coming from such a lower penetration rate that the -- uptick giving more pricing add and the value consumers are placing on it continues to improve. And the core DRAM growth, obviously, doesn't in line with the same traffic, so it's kind of in a much larger share of the platform.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. One more, if I could. You mentioned Windows 8 being a catalyst eventually. It sounds like you've not yet seen some much of the boost. Can you talk about your expectations around the build cycle there and maybe about average density as it pertains to now that we have Windows RT and we have Windows X86?","D. Mark Durcan","We believe that the builds have largely taken place. And as Mark mentioned in his commentary, PC OEMs are being extremely conservative. They don't want to have a high risk of inventory obsolescence. And in terms of the second part of your question, remind me again?","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I guess I was wondering about what this does to average density, especially now that we've got to deal with the factor of the Windows RT versions out there.","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, let me answer it maybe 2 ways. If you go on to a lot of the online website sales organizations for the various large OEMs, you're seeing a fairly large concentration now at 6 and 8 gigabytes. That being said, when you look at the third-party data, they're only suggesting about a 20% to 25% bit growth from the PC area for next year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dean Grumlose from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin Cassidy. I have a question and a follow-up. As we head into next fiscal year, can you comment on your expected change in the NAND Flash wafer output?","D. Mark Durcan","We don't expect a large change in the number of wafers currently.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, do you have a projection on how your mix of SLC versus MLC and TLC may change, heading into next quarter?","D. Mark Durcan","It won't change all that much from where we are today. We're running basically high 70% MLC and the balance is split pretty evenly between SLC and TLC.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I was just wondering, Mark, can you give us some color in terms of the past quarter, in terms of how the sequential ASP trends were between the 2 SSD segments? And how much more value can you add to strengthen the ASP in that segment? And I have a follow-up.","Mark W. Adams","Sure. Well, I think, as the track of cost per gigabytes and ASPs have gone throughout our 2012 year, the demand cycle for client SSDs went up significantly, and that's what's showing up in our financials as far as the client SSD performance. When I look at how much more value is there, I think the value around that is driven by the industry's ability to remain competitive on the ASP front to drive a good level of demand on the longer term PC builds. I think that seems to be in a pretty good place today. So I think there's -- with increased or newer ability to drive cost down over the next 6 to 12 months, we would anticipate a continued demand growth there. On the enterprise side, there's a lot more ability, obviously, to differentiate both in terms of form factor, as well as performance and reliability features, that we think is already in place but will continue to grow as the development -- as we talked about earlier in our controllers and firmware and error correction, those types of things fit into our product portfolio, which will again allow us to drive more differentiation and value.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Follow-up on this. Can you give us some color on the 2013 CapEx between the DRAM, NAND and the NOR segment? And does it include Elpida at this point of time? Or should we model something going to be incrementally for Elpida once the acquisition gets closed?","D. Mark Durcan","Yes. So I think in terms of NAND and DRAM, roughly balanced. And that number that we floated out there, $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion, we continue to work on that. And as we really tune our investment for 2013, just on what's strictly needed to drive particular product introductions and efficiency in our technology implementation. Elpida is not included in that number. Obviously, depending on when we close Elpida, the numbers will change. But I think you should expect that to the extent we are investing in Elpida, we'll be trading those opportunities off against internal opportunities to make sure that we'll put the capital in the highest return on investment.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","If I could just add one quick follow-up. Can you just characterize how much of it was supply cost in the DRAM between the first half of this year and the second half of this year?","D. Mark Durcan","Probably need to ask the people who actually made the cut, to be honest with it.","Kipp A. Bedard","With that, we'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

Mark?","Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. I am pleased with our team\u2019s performance this quarter. Our diverse product portfolio and balanced customer base produced solid financial results. Revenue was within our guidance at $4.2 billion and GAAP net income was $934 million or $0.78 per share. Gross margins in DRAM and trade NAND were in line or better than guidance. Importantly, we are starting to see the early benefits of our NAND product and technology repositioning. Free cash flow was approximately 400 million in the second fiscal quarter based on operating cash flow of 1.25 billion, plus CapEx of 853 million.","We finished the quarter with $6.35 billion of cash and short-term investments after successful execution of $1 billion straight debt offering. We remain very positive on the long-term prospects for our business despite short-term headwinds in certain segments. We expect to continue generating strong operating cash flow as we optimize technology, operations, product and segment mix. Micron\u2019s fiscal Q3 guidance is $3.8 billion to $4.05 billion. The midpoint of the range is about 6% lower than revenue in Q2. This guidance indicates the willingness to hold inventory if needed.","Let me talk a little bit more about technology. Today the significant majority of our mobile DRAM and non-Inotera production is on 25 nanometers. Our advanced DRAM technology deployment is going very smoothly. The 20 nanometer yield ramp is exceeding both our plan and results achieved on previous process node introductions. We continue to expect commercial volume in the second half of 2015 with the majority of our DRAM bits on 20 nanometer in the first half of calendar year 2016, 1X nanometer DRAM development is also proceeding well and we recently started the early silicon in Hiroshima.","We\u2019re currently in pilot production of our gen 1 32 layers 3D NAND with early sampling in progress. We expect to be in full production of both MLC and TLC versions by calendar Q4 of this year with system level solutions following soon thereafter. 3D will be a meaningful percentage of our trade NAND supply in calendar 2016 and will represent a majority of our bits during 2017. Our gen 2 3D NAND technology is progressing nicely in R&D. ","Turning now to bit growth, we expect our calendar year 2015 DRAM bits produced to be up mid-teens although product mix adjustments including an increased mix of DDR4 and mobile DRAM could impact bit growth. Mix adjustment decisions are based on margin optimization and strategic positioning and are not necessarily aligned with maximizing bit growth. In 2015 we\u2019re focused on technology enablement and we\u2019re comfortable growing bits below the market in the near-term in favor of driving long-term market opportunities for Micron.","For 2016 as we see the benefit of 20 nanometer conversions we expect to be in line with or slightly above the industry bit growth. We expect our trade NAND bit growth to be below marketing calendar \u201915 as we tune our product portfolio to more value-added applications and prepare for a 3D manufacturing ramp throughout 2016. Once complete our Singapore fab expansion and ongoing conversion of existing planar capacity to 3D NAND could support 40% to 50% bit growth per annum over an extended time horizon. The exact timing of these investments is dependent on market conditions and the expected ROIC but this is an exciting initiative for the company.","With respect to capital allocation we continue to believe in long-term value of investment in our business to drive manufacturing efficiencies and future growth. We also continue to prioritize appropriate investments in R&D including memory sub-systems and systems development and manufacturing capacity. We\u2019re actively managing our cash balances including the deployment of $2.8 billion over the past six quarters to reduce dilution associated with convertible debt. We also repurchased approximately $200 million of common stock in fiscal Q2 under an existing $1 billion stock repurchase program.","Now for an update on our finance team, we have a number of outstanding CFO candidates under consideration and are working to identify the best fit for Micron. While we work through that process the finance team is reporting to Mark Adams as Interim CFO. Our finance leadership team has decades of collective experience at Micron and other leading semiconductor companies. The team includes among others Mark Heil Micron\u2019s long time Controller and current Interim Principal Financial Accounting Officer. I have asked Mark to cover the financial portions of our prepared remarks today.","Before I turn the call over to rest of the team I would like to reiterate that there are a number of significant factors that we believe will deliver growth, margin improvement and strong financial results for Micron towards the end of 2015 and heading into fiscal 2016. Among other things these include 20 nanometer DRAM, 16 nanometer TLC NAND, 3D NAND, mobile NAND, eMCPs, enterprise SSDs, and the Inotera contract change.","I\u2019ll stop here and turn it over to Mark Heil and Mark Adams before turning for Q&A.","Mark Heil","Thanks Mark. The second quarter of fiscal 2015 ended on March 5th. When comparing the Q2 results to the first quarter recall that the first quarter was a 14 week period rather than our normal 13 week period. The results for the second quarter include net income of $934 million or $0.78 per share on net sales of 4.166 billion; gross margins came in at 34%. Our reported income from equity method investments for the second quarter was $208 million substantially all of which was attributable to Inotera. Our share of Inotera\u2019s results includes a benefit of 65 million from their release of a valuation allowance on their deferred tax assets that was reflected in their December 31, 2014 year-end results.","Aside from recurring items the benefit from Inotera\u2019s tax adjustment is the only other noteworthy non-GAAP adjustment this quarter. So non-GAAP income for the second quarter was $941 million or $0.81 per share. Relating to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter please refer to the dilution table that\u2019s posted along with the other materials for this call on our Web site. The dilution table reflects the anti-dilutive effects of our capped calls at various assumed stock prices.","Looking at the results and other guidance for the third quarter by product line let\u2019s start first with DRAM. DRAM revenue decreased 13% compared to the first quarter reflecting a 9% decrease in bit sales volume and a 6% decrease in average selling prices. Lower bit sales were largely attributable to the extra week in fiscal Q1. DRAM gross margin was better than anticipated being stable comparing Q1 to Q2 as bit cost decreases nearly offset decreases in selling prices. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter using quarter-to-date ASPM projected mix for the quarter should be down compared to Q2 based on bit sales that are guided to be flat, average selling prices down high single-digits and cost per bit down low single-digits.","Key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the third quarter include bit production up high single-digits over each of the next couple of quarters as 25 nanometer yields continue to improve. This increase is net of anticipated affects of increased mix of mobile and DDR-4 products which generally have lower bit densities. Our sales guidance anticipates taking strategic action to reduce PC DRAM sales this quarter given the recent demand and price weakness. Therefore we\u2019re guiding bit sales to be flat for the quarter. We believe the PC DRAM segment will show improvement in the second half of the calendar year based on the stabilizing demand profile. Fiscal Q3 to-date mix adjusted ASP is below the second quarter average due to pricing pressure in PC DRAM over the past several months and a high volume of products sold in die form.","On the trade NAND side revenue increased 3% in the second quarter with a 12% increase in bit sales volume, partially offset by a 9% decrease in the average selling price. Trade NAND gross margin declined to the low 20% range as cost reductions per bit only partially offset decreases in selling prices. Trade NAND gross margins for the third quarter using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter are expected to be relatively stable compared to Q2 based on bit production down low single-digits, ASPs up single-digits primary from a higher mix of mobile products and cost per bit up mid single-digits also primarily on mix.","Key trends for the third quarter affecting the guidance are like-for-like pricing relatively flat, relatively stable component and client SSD markets, lower bit sales into the component spot market which had a negative effect on bit growth and cost per bit but improving effect on average selling prices. And finally continued focus on mobile and managed NAND products which has an improving effect on margin with increases both in ASP and cost per bit. On a consolidated basis, we\u2019re guiding total revenue for the third quarter to be in the range of 3.8 billion to 4.05 billion.","Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, SG&A is expected to be relatively stable over the next several quarters in the 180 million to 190 million range. Research and development expense in the second quarter was just below our guided range primarily due to a lower volume of wafers used for development. We expect R&D expense to trend up slightly over the next couple of quarters in line with development activities. The Company generated operating cash flow in the second quarter of 1.25 billion and ended the quarter with 6.35 billion in cash and marketable investments. During the second quarter we received $1 billion in proceeds from the issuance of high yield notes our first successful offering of straight debt with near investment grade terms. We anticipate utilizing proceeds to repurchase or convert outstanding convertible notes and other debt and for other general corporate purposes.","We also replaced our $255 million Singapore-based AR backed credit line with the $750 million line no amounts have yet been drawn under that facility. The second instalment on the Elpida creditor\u2019s debt of approximately US$150 million was paid during the second quarter. We also repurchased 6.5 million shares for $192 million under the Board authorized $1 billion share buyback program. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment year-to-date are 1.5 billion and we continue to expect expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $3.6 billion and $4 billion with the stepped up level of spending in the latter half of the fiscal year as we execute on 20 nanometer DRAM and commence 3D NAND investments.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments on the operating results.","Mark Adams","Thanks Mark. Good afternoon and thanks for joining our call. I am going to change my format a little today and begin by providing some thoughts around both our DRAM and NAND business and the respective markets followed by a deeper dive into our business units.","Fiscal Q2 showed some seasonal weakness which is not uncommon coming out of the holidays considering the timing of Chinese New Year is within our quarter I was pleased with our operating performance. The strength of our diverse product portfolio contributed to relatively stable gross margins quarter-on-quarter. We saw some pricing pressure in the PC segment, but generally all other market demand remained healthy. DRAM represented 65% of our total revenue in Q2. As a percent of that DRAM revenue mobile represented mid-20% similar to Q1, the PC segment represented low-30% down from mid-30% from prior quarter and server business was about low-20% up a few percentage points, while networking, AIMM and graphics were each below 10% similar to the Q1 mix.","We are allocating less production to the PC segment and continuing to shift more bit stores towards the other faster growing segments. We also continue to move production from DDR-3 to DDR-4 as our customer demand grows. Although these manufacturing move generally weigh on production bit output guidance, our DRAM process transitions will more than make up for the bit and wafer effect as a result we are guiding to high single-digit sequential output growth for each of the next couple of quarters.","Our DRAM team is executing through key technology transitions over our second half. We\u2019re driving expanded 25 nanometer production and preparing for second half calendar year \u201915 conversion to 20 nanometer across our fab network. DRAM technology enablement remains a key focus for our teams. We are pleased with the market acceptance of our DDR4 technology as major OEMs are adopting Micron\u2019s products for their value-added segments. We are qualified across all Intel server platforms and we\u2019re seeing very strong demand signals for our 8 gigabit DDR4 products and in particular from the enterprise server and networking customer base. DDR4 ASPs remain at a premium to DDR3.","The NAND market has gone through some challenging quarters of late, but we\u2019ve seen signs that the market pricing has stabilized. As a percentage of total revenue trade NAND represented 29% with gross margins down slightly quarter-on-quarter as we guided during our first quarter call. Within trade NAND, the sales components represented about 50% in the second quarter. SSD units approximately 20%, our mobile NAND was roughly low teens while AIMM and other embedded were roughly in the mid single-digit percentages. We continue to leverage our industry leading MLC NAND flash in key segments that demand higher performance. We\u2019re significantly reducing our NAND supply to the spot market down 30% quarter-over-quarter and as a result our trade NAND bit growth in the coming quarters will be limited. Working with our partner Intel, we recently showcased our new 3D vertical NAND technology an innovative manufacturing approach that extends more large trajectory for flash storage cost and performance.","Micron\u2019s high density 3D NAND flash devices will enable small form vector drives with 1 terabyte of storage and standard 2.5 SSDs with greater than 10 terabytes of storage. We expect the improved performance of Micron 3D NAND technology to open up expanded segment opportunities. We plan to commence early 3D production in the second half of the calendar year. Our 16 nanometer TLC product is coming along nicely and we are on-track for initial component shipment in late May, early June.","And moving onto our business unit discussion, in our Computing and Networking Business Unit, referred to as CNBU, our revenue was 1.8 billion in fiscal Q2. The PC notebook business saw a reduced demand and pricing pressure, yet turned in operating profit up only slightly at 27%. Interestingly, customers took forecasted delivery which we interpreted to be generally positive as it pertains to overall channel inventory and future shipments. We saw continued growth in our server business driven by cloud computing and enterprise. Server DRAM bit growth is forecasted up roughly 40% year-on-year in 2015. The growth in server memory is based on increasing server workloads that require a high DRAM performance and density. We continue to invest in expansion of our server business, as this segment offers a growth demand profile that is less sensitive to price fluctuations.","The Networking segment delivered strong gross margins while achieving flat revenue quarter-over-quarter despite ASP pressure in the broader DRAM market. Demand remained stable driven by LTE build out in the emerging markets. Demand for DRAM supply in growing data communications, video and gaming content is estimated at roughly 20% in calendar year 2015. We believe this will drive higher demand for Micron\u2019s memory products and networking going forward next year.","Our Graphics business led by DDR5 is another growing specialty DRAM market for Micron. Last year Capital doubled their memory content per system and there will be additional content growth this year as the use of these devices continues to expand beyond gaming into compute and home entertainment. Graphics products for the PC segment also reported growth in Q2. Demand for overall DRAM graphics is projected to be up 25% year-over-year in 2015.","The revenue for our Storage Business Unit or referred to as SBU was recorded at 954 million in Q2, down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Although our SBU operating margins were down quarter-over-quarter we believe the business is stabilizing and it should improve going forward. We announced three new enterprise products, the co-developed fast drive, a new PCIe express drive and a new database solution. We also announced strategic alliances with Seagate and IBM in the enterprise storage market. Our agreement with Seagate provides an opportunity to sell high performance MLC components and accelerates our expansion into the enterprise flash SSD market. Micron\u2019s current plan in our enterprise drives are based on our award winning 16 nanometer MLC technology which more and more of our customers are seeking due to superior performance compared to competitors\u2019 planar TLC drives. We see a value segment in the channel for planar TLC SSDs and are expecting a late Q3, early Q4 calendar year shipments of our Micron branded 15 nanometer TLC client drive.","The mobile business or MBU had another strong quarter. MBU revenues came in at 856 million with operating margins at 31% in Q2. We have indicated on prior calls that our main focus on mobile is optimizing the business for profitability and diversifying the customer base. The team has done a nice job in executing to these objectives. We continue to see strong demand for our mobile products, one example is the increasing prevalence of 3 and 4 gigabyte low power DRAM configurations and a super mid and high-end smartphone segments. We also continue to see significant growth opportunities for Micron in eMCPs. eMCPs generally include 1 to 2 gigabytes of low power DRAM and 8 to 16 gigabytes of NAND in an integrated package. With our innovative DRAM known good die offering and 16 nanometer NAND technology Micron is uniquely positioned to cash for this growing opportunity as eMCPs replace eMMC in the large segments. Revenues in eMCP were up 70% quarter-on-quarter as mobile NAND bit shipments nearly doubled when compared to Q1. We remain bullish on memory content in mobile as evolving system architectures steadily increase density requirements in all handset segments.","Higher performance 64 bit application processor SOCs supporting at your OS platforms the richer applications as well as large screen sizes and more advanced gaming all contribute to increased memory density delivering more rewarding experience.","Our embedded business posted revenue of 502 million and operating margins were up slightly quarter-over-quarter to 23%. The automotive segment continues to drive EBU performance with the revenue increase of over 10% when compared to the same quarter in fiscal year 2014. We continue to invest in custom segment solutions to drive our leadership in the embedded memory market across all the EBU segments, including IMM Industrial Medical and multi-market, gaming and the connected home.","We\u2019re seeing strong market reception for Micron\u2019s next-generation serial NOR Flash product family and should benefit from the signing up of an open industry standardization agreement. We initiated qualification sampling of 16 and 32 gigabyte eMMC version 5.0 to customers in Q2 and began production for the embedded SSD product that addresses the needs of our auto, IMM and gaming customers. A complete portfolio of memory solutions including DRAM, NAND and NOR along with industry consolidation is strengthening Micron\u2019s embedded value proposition as a stable memory focused solutions supplier to the embedded market. In fact now DRAM and NAND now make up more than 70% of our overall embedded business and growing. In closing we\u2019re confident in the long-term dynamics of the memory industry and remain focused on optimizing our margins and returns over the long-term.","With that I will hand it back over to Kipp.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks Mark. We now like to take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions] And with that please open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And first question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur","Good to see your DRAM bit supply in upper trajectory, I know that there was some concern that 25 nanometer and 20 nanometer transitions and some of the initial prep work may have inhibited some of the supply growth here in May but it\u2019s good to see that back on a growth trajectory. Can you just help us understand what are the drivers for the bit supply decline in NAND in the May quarter and do you guys expect the resumption of supply growth starting in the August quarter?","Mark Adams","Well, there is a couple of things, one, the primary issue is the mix issue as we shift our products directed more towards mobile and end product SSDs. The second factor is we are getting our factories ready for both transition to new process technology, 16 nanometer TLC, as well as prepping for - in Singapore starting the process for 3D manufacturing.","Harlan Sur","And then I think on the last call you talked about relatively high levels of inventories of SSDs coming out fiscal Q1. What\u2019s your assessment of SSD inventory levels exiting Q2 and then if you can just give us an update on your 16 nanometer SSD products. I think you might have mentioned it, sorry if I have missed this but I think you were talking about last time sort of ramping 16 nanometer SSD kind of second half of this year?","Mark Adams","That\u2019s right. Our assessment is that the industry inventory position on SSDs is improving. We actually think the pricing in the NAND business is stabilized quarter-to-date, and relative to Micron\u2019s performance we've got a number of products that are going out [in qual] [ph] to OEMs that are based on our 16 nanometer MLC, interestingly enough for us we\u2019re seeing a lot of people or some of our customers revert back to an MLC-based SSD drive based on some of the issues that have come up with competitive offerings on performance and endurance and reliability.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox, Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit to the storage business unit. The business swung to losses, I think you partially explained that but maybe we could talk about that a little bit. And then you\u2019ve given some reasons why those losses should reverse back to profits. But I was wondering if you could talk through maybe a roadmap to get into acceptable margins and where you see maybe margins exiting calendar year, et cetera? Thanks.","Mark Adams","So this is Mark I will take the question we try to avoid speculating on future pricing and in projecting margins out in the future but I will comment that we continue to feel very good about the execution of the team in delivering against closing the gap competitively and for all the reasons we\u2019ve talked about in the past those signs are happening; I have talked about in my earlier comments how our mobile NAND business is growing quarter-over-quarter - had a very successful growth trajectory. I think that the 16 nanometer MLC SSD that I communicated just a second ago are pretty good. Our alliance with Seagate and the SaaS development in getting access to these SaaS market earlier than we otherwise would have is pretty good and as we commented into the market last week in our announcement with Intel on the 3D NAND technology we still continue to feel that we\u2019re in a very competitive and market leading position in 3D NAND. So, with all those things in place we are pretty bullish about NAND and we continue to think we\u2019re going to close the gap.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney","I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on your outlook for the DRAM industry for the second half of the year and if you could just talk I know you don\u2019t want to give specific pricing guidance. But if you could at least just talk to the trajectory and linearity of DRAM ASPs over the course of the second quarter and what sort of confidence that may or may not give you as you look into second half overall DRAM\u2019s bottom-end trends?","Mark Adams","Mark, this is Mark Adams. I think that we remain bullish in general on DRAM going forward for the following reasons. First of all, we think that the second half of the calendar year is going to be pretty strong in mobile and all signs are indicating to that. We do think that the PC capacity needs to be shifted over that to address that opportunity and that will balance out some of the current market conditions around PC. I am not sure how to call the PC market other than to say that we think it could improve from here because it is not doing so well and we think the back half of the year with Microsoft new OS and holidays and so on so forth we think it\u2019s just got to be better and hopefully than that it is today. Beyond that when you look at our business we think as we have talked about in the past that it\u2019s a more rational industry and with that is coming better behaviour and as Mark talked about earlier we\u2019re going to do the right things to run our business and if that means not selling inventory below acceptable prices we\u2019ll do it. So if I look at all of that I think about other end market growth I think we\u2019re still in a pretty bullish perspective about DRAM will play out in the second half here.","Mark Delaney","That\u2019s helpful, and it actually kind of gets to my follow-up question, which is around your comments you\u2019re making about holding inventory. Could you elaborate about how long you think you could hold inventory and then can you just talked about how would have to happen if you\u2019re sitting on inventory and market pricing continued to decline just how quickly you have to true up your inventory with pricing in the market?","Mark Adams","Interesting, let me comment on one thing around inventory that you didn\u2019t really asked for but I will get to your answer. General inventory has increased a little bit since the first quarter. Now my interpretation of that is pretty positive. The people who accumulate this inventory on channel that\u2019s how they make money, they make money by taking inventory and waiting to sell in a better market and the accumulation of this is just not dramatic but it\u2019s probably now four or six weeks in DRAM and NAND and as you think about that they\u2019re buying memory at current market pricing and they\u2019re betting on a rebound and these are some people who have been in the business for quite some time I happen to believe that\u2019s a pretty positive sign. Now relating back to the question on how we can do that, well I am not going to give you a number or weeks on-hand or what have you but we do believe that given the diversity of our end markets it is more a matter how we shift our capacity and now that we sit on a bunch of old aged inventory we would just move our capacity to better end markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","Just two for clarification, you are guiding high single-digit for production of DRAM bits but for more - for shipment and revenue purposes it\u2019s flattish?","Mark Adams","That\u2019s right.","Monika Garg","So the second question I have is if you look quarter to-date ASP guidance of DRAM you\u2019re guiding minus 9%, it was about minus 6% last quarter. When do you think we see some stabilization in PC DRAM pricing and also if you could talk about pricing the other segments of DRAM like mobile DRAM and server DRAM going forward?","Mark Adams","Sure, Monika this is Mark Adams, relative to pricing it\u2019s hard for us to get on that and try to make projections out in the future. What I would say is the comparison between the 9% and 6% Q2 and Q3 remember the 6% was off a much higher base coming into Q1 and so the 9% and 6% are not really apples-to-apples. We do believe that for the reason I say it is earlier that the overall DRAM business will remain in pretty good shape we don\u2019t see massive price pressure in any of the other segments - are down 6% actually and Q2 was PC down a lot more than 6% and the other segments flat to even some better. So what I would say there is that we don\u2019t see a lot of pressure in the other segments at this point.","Now remember each of the businesses this is what is great about diversification, each of these businesses act differently, meaning for example the commodity component DRAM business is what it is and we have noted to be it is a lot smaller portion of our business, but when you look at things like mobile, mobile is a different business. It's a design in business, more concentrated customers in the number of 10 to 15 major customers that we sell to and we negotiate with them and we negotiate more long-term and so that\u2019s a different business. So the pricing dynamics are much different. The fact that pricing stays good it is a great sign for us in mobile and our costs can get better and as we grow our market share we are going to continue to expand our business and that\u2019s true if we look at each of the segments whether it\u2019s the embedded, mobile, networking and automotive that\u2019s all true in terms of how we look at the business, we take each of them as individual segments that run differently.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Line is open. Go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini","Just a question here first, given your ASP cost and bit production and shipment trend, how should we think about trends in DRAM margin profile by different segments particularly for PC, mobile and server DRAM from the coverage quarter to the current quarter and I have just another one?","Kipp Bedard","We\u2019re not going to dive into gross margin by segment, but we\u2019ll give you another chance to ask a different question if you like.","Mehdi Hosseini","How should we think about the impact of use of the inventory since you think demand is going to high, how should we think about the impact of the inventory of that on margin profile in the current quarter?","Mark Durcan","Yes, I think the answer maybe it is Mark Durcan I think the answer is the same that we\u2019re not going to try and predict margins, but the fact that we\u2019re talking about this and by the way it's nothing new. But the fact that we\u2019re talking about our willingness to hold some inventory here. Is really reflective of the fact that we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence, as we move into the back half of the year we\u2019re seeing a lot of signals, Mark talked about a bunch of them I\u2019ll say even with the compute business we get signals from some customers that maybe they want to look at longer term ordering patterns et cetera. So, we got a lot of confidence that this is going to be pretty solid in the back half of the year and that\u2019s probably about all we can say about it.","Mehdi Hosseini","And looking into the NAND and alliance with Seagate and the recent optimism about 3D NAND especially looking into this 48th layer and the fact that Intel also has some collaboration Western Digital, how do all these dynamics play out into 2016 but maybe 48 million 3D NAND would become cost effective to commercialized, do you have direct alliance with Seagate and you have indirect supply into Western Digital through Intel, and any thoughts or any qualitative assessment that you can offer us looking into next year given this kind of a dynamic?","Mark Durcan","Yes let me just say this Mehdi, we compete with Intel in the marketplace, we have for a long time and we expect that Intel product whether it is hit by Intel or by Western Digital will be competitive or will be competing with my comp solutions in the market in 2016. Now the good news is, we think we\u2019ve got a great 3D NAND solution and we also have a lot of capacity at Micron and so we think that overtime, we\u2019re well positioned to do well in that business.","Mehdi Hosseini","But if 3D NAND is going to be the disruptive technology it is going to be the canvas, how you're going to be able to manage the conflict of interest when you're effectively supplying these three different entities?","Mark Durcan","Well it's -- remember Mehdi it is -- the partnership we have with Intel is the co-development, the core technology that\u2019s a big piece of the solution, other areas are the SaaS controller, the firmware, the software and the go-to-market capabilities that each of the other people are interested in it is the Seagate and Western Digital references that comes into the equation of going to market with a full-fledged enterprise SaaS SSD. So as we look at that it's our core technology we have dealt with our partner and there is really two avenues one with Intel taking it through their channel, and one with us taking through our channel.","Kipp Bedard","And by the way if they do well, we\u2019ll be happy to sell them some NAND flash.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from CJ Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","CJ Muse","I guess first question regarding your pricing guide for DRAM down high single-digits, can you talk about what like-for-like pricing looks like versus mix shift?","Mark Durcan","So when you think about the pricing like-for-like, the overall price I think we have guided down was 9% for the quarter. So high single-digits and as I made the comment earlier that, that was really driven by where we have exited Q2 going into Q3 as some of the mix changes that to think about our business mobile server and the other markets have pretty stable pricing. So a lot of the fluctuation in the guidance we are giving you is coming out of a quarter that started higher, ended lowered and then we\u2019re starting kind of in the lower base.","CJ Muse","And then as my follow-up, can you walk through the progression that you see in terms of the 20 nanometer ramp at Inotera when you start to see bit production and then when you expect that will have shipment in revenues. And then I guess overtime what are the milestones in terms of percentage of your overall DRAM mix and whatever timeframe you want to discuss?","Mark Durcan","So let me characterize it generally for Micron and then I think relative to Inotera you can get some more specifics from them. But for 20 nanometer we've said the second half of calendar 2016 will be -- sorry the second half of this calendar year will be ramping, and by the time we get into the first half of 2016 it will be the majority of our debt mix.","CJ Muse","And will you say ramping that is production or that is shipment?","Mark Durcan","That is production.","CJ Muse","And how should we think about the\u2026?","Mark Durcan","Let me say it this way then, there will be significant shipments in Q4 of the calendar year for Micron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rajvindra Gill","Wondering if you could discuss a little bit about the competitive pricing environment in DRAM and NAND, you gave some highlights in terms of what the actual numbers are, but wondering kind of qualitatively what\u2019s happening in the market, and a lot of this positive pieces on the DRAM industry where some rationalization that\u2019s occurring in the industry a rational behaviour. So I\u2019m just wondering if you are seeing that continue if you could describe a little bit about that it will helpful.","Mark Durcan","As I have highlighted today in our script and some of our comments that the real catalyst for some of the disruption here in not just the PC segment was really the demand side. And I think if you talk to other people in that business in the PC business the hard drive guys, the CPUs, the unit declined in the PC notebook segment kind of drove some of this and an interesting thing for us is that none of the other segments kind of showed that, and when you think about where our business is today where it might have come from years ago is, yes our pricing in one of the segments had some pressure in the first quarter, I am sorry in the second quarter. We felt pretty good about the rest of our business and it kind of showed up in our performance. So as I think about driving for us, we clearly in Micron if you look at industry pricing and you look at kind of pricing for gigabit and DRAM for example Micron is clearly the leader in pricing in ASP terms. And so at least historically we've been and we feel like we\u2019re today, and we\u2019re going to continue to try to drive it up and with that, that might mean holding inventory like we said it might mean moving to other segments, server, networking, mobile so on so forth. And so that\u2019s kind of the picture today, I think that my comment earlier about what the timing of channel inventory and even our customer reaction we've had customers try to who initially wanted to get off the quarterly pricing come back to us in this past quarter and want to go back to quarterly pricing. So we\u2019re generally bullish on the dynamics of pricing in the market. And yes there was an industry catalyst in the form of demand for PC, notebooks that drove a little bit of disruption in the business we don\u2019t think it\u2019s major, yes it\u2019s if so you can measure it but the rest of our business is pretty good.","Rajvindra Gill","And on the NAND side, you talked about NAND pricing stabilizing a bit, just wondering what\u2019s driving that stabilization. And can you comment in terms of what percentage of your NAND business will be TLC exiting this year and should we start to see NAND gross margins increases as we exit this year?","Mark Durcan","Well as we think about our business, we think about the end-markets where they are going where the products will be generating the highest return and as we achieved our strategic objectives in NAND. And on a competitive basis okay we believe we will be closing the gap between our competitors in the second half of our fiscal year and throughout 2015 calendar, we believe that will happen. TLC today is less than 10% it\u2019s not a large number today, and as we ramp our staffs it won\u2019t be materially much larger. You will see some growth in the back half of the year but it won\u2019t be materially much larger because we've got other parts of our business whether it be mobile or I talked about the success of our MLC 16 nanometer product as Tier 1 OEM. So we will seek TLC growth at Micron but we\u2019re not going to do it just to do it, we need that mixture nature that we are getting the right value for it and that\u2019s important to us and our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tristan Gerra","Given the strength of the U.S. dollar there has been some concern about potential dispatching of the year one content that have been PCs. Is that a trend that you are currently seeing or I expect in the second half?","Mark Durcan","I think for us the question around FX is really more a question around what is worldwide GDP growth going to be. We\u2019re a global company. We\u2019ve got global customers some will do better in some FX situation some will do slightly worse. But unless something dramatic happens to worldwide GDP growth we think we\u2019re pretty well positioned with manufacturing all around the world and with customers all around the world some of which will do better in certain circumstances and some of which won\u2019t. So we\u2019re not overly worried about it. Obviously we have manufacturing in Japan and there is a certain cost reduction associated with the weakening yen. Obviously we got some manufacturing in Singapore and certain costs associated with the strengthening Sing But net, net for Micron these aren\u2019t huge effects.","Tristan Gerra","And then what does the ramp of 3D NAND means from an equipment reuse and the point is this going to be a significant percentage of your existing equipment and could this impact the DRAM production next year if some of the equipment gets shifted to other product lines?","Mark Durcan","Absolutely we plan a lot of equipment reuse as we transition planar NAND to 3D NAND I assume that was the question is 3D transition\u2026?","Tristan Gerra","Yes.","Mark Durcan","So there is incremental equipment required the incremental floor space there is some amount of tooling all of which can be reused in other parts of our or the vast majority of which can be reused in other parts of our business. But generally speaking we will be trading out planar NAND wafers for incremental for 3D NAND wafers. And we think that\u2019s the most capital efficient way to run the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kevin Cassidy","May be along those lines also with 3D NAND, is that a drag on gross margins as it first ramps into production and when do you think would be the crossover where it could be a tailwind to gross margin?","Mark Durcan","Sure, it\u2019s almost always a short-term drag on GM when you make the transition like this you\u2019ve got new tools coming in and it takes a while to qualify and get them loaded, et cetera, et cetera. And there are existing efficiencies associated with yields ramps et cetera. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable by the time we get to late in the year, late in this calendar year. We\u2019ll be looking pretty good.","Kevin Cassidy","And you also mentioned that if the DRAM pricing isn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect you\u2019re willing to hold inventory is there any willingness to cut CapEx or is that fixed for this year?","Mark Durcan","We would be willing to do that if we thought the market situation were such that that would make sense to us. I can\u2019t actually foresee that sitting here today. Clearly as we think about our plans for 2016 and things a little bit further out we\u2019ll take into account where the market goes over the next number of months and quarters. But as we sit here today we just told you we think things are looking pretty good so we\u2019re not anticipating making any major changes as we sit at the table today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Amir from Ladenburg. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Pardon me your line is open. Please go ahead, if you have your phone on mute un-mute your phone please.","Daniel Amir","So in terms of the DRAM side you have expressed that PC DRAM you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s going to decline here in the next couple of quarters. What is the ideal mix that you kind of see your mix of DRAM a year from now? Is it PC DRAM kind of in the 20% level or do you expect it to decline and then come back maybe to 30%?","Mark Durcan","I think directionally where you are going initially was right we think over time it will decline as a percentage of the mix and a lot of it does depend on the business but I think directionally we think you\u2019re spot on.","Daniel Amir","And then the second question is related to it sounds like the eMCP business is something that one of your growth drivers here. Do you feel that this is kind of the leading factor here to drive your mobile business? I mean it\u2019s up 70% Q-over-Q in the eMMC space you probably didn\u2019t have as a bigger competitive advantage is now that you have in the eMMC space given that you have a very good integrated product then with the DRAM side?","Mark Durcan","Yes I think it absolutely I mean in full transparency we\u2019re coming off a somewhat lower base but I think we have stated in prior calls we have stated we think eMCP is for the mobile business coming out of our fiscal year will be somewhere around 25% little bit lower than 25%. But somewhere up from zero in the last 12 months so we as you identified it\u2019s a strategic play for us leveraging our portfolio and quite honestly given our make up in the mobile business we think we\u2019ve got advantage over just about anybody in the space.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Wong","Could you give us some idea about the ownership of the IP associated with 3D NAND technology between Micron, Intel or joint venture entity? And so there was some concern about someone encroaching on your IP or the prosperity of licensing the IP who does the negotiations will drive the legal action?","Mark Durcan","We\u2019re not going to talk about intellectual property strategy, David but I can tell you that we do that, we fund the development together, we do it jointly and we both own different pieces of the intellectual property but beyond that it is not a lot I want to talk about.","David Wong","Well then could you give us some idea of the proportion of your DRAM production in the May quarter between PC DRAM for memory, how you're allocating what you're actually making?","Mark Durcan","Well I think David, I\u2019ll kind of get back and give you some of the comments I gave earlier. We think PC DRAM in the quarter will be down from mid-30s in Q2 to low to 30% kind of range and we think that that will signal increases in other areas such as mobile in the mid-20% server in the low 20% of our business. And so we see kind of a blend it is not just one category picking up with the PC business, mobile is the more capacity will allocate the server some PC business to server and we\u2019ll look at networking on those as well, so that\u2019s kind of a full suite of things we evaluate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Newman","You talked about the inventory on the DRAM side and you're saying your production is going to be up high single-digits, what are the assumptions you're using for the mix shipments for Q3?","Mark Durcan","Mark, I think in the business we can\u2019t, we said basically flat on shipments that we know we don\u2019t say a whole lot more in terms of future guidance. But I think it is just that in other comments around what we\u2019re going to do what is right for the business to drive returning margins and it is not going to be fire sale advantage for us.","Mark Newman","And then a follow-up question on NAND flash, I thought I heard you say components 50% of NAND, could you clarify that, perhaps I misheard? And then I wanted to get some of this kind of ideas from you about how is that going to be fixed over the long-term because clearly as you increase the percentage of your solutions and decrease the percentage of were NAND components that obviously very good for your margins basically moving up the value stack to create to catch more of the value but in addition to that it actually helps to consolidate the NAND market by essentially taking out the competitors because a lot of those were NAND customers are actually in the end of the day there also competitors certainly flash cards and SSD. So could you give us some better roadmap for how we can expect that percentage of components to decrease going forward?","Mark Durcan","So the data I spoke to in my opening comments was that in Q2 component shipments includes cards and components and now it is somewhere around the area of 50% of our overall shipments in the quarter Q2. In Q3 alone that number will be cut by 30% as we start the transition of what you just highlighted away from component card sales to mobile and SSDs. Part of that dynamic by the way in discussing how this plays out is we now will be shipping in the quarters 16 nanometer MLC followed by drives that were in process and didn\u2019t have that volume in Q2. So the move from components and cards to mobile and then client SSD based on 16 nanometer certainly is a positive move for us as you say we move up the stack and we continue to drive things like in enterprise drive both PCIe and SaaS as we explained earlier. That\u2019s how you should think about our target and I mentioned also I think we gave guidance that NAND did grow will be flat to down in the Q3 timeframe as we think about the evolution for 3D manufacturing stuff as well as switch to some of our capacity to those 16 nanometer TLC. We think that all kind of resonates to a better optimize mix of products for NAND portfolio.","Mark Newman","If I could ask just one quick follow-up on for LP DDR4, my understanding is Apple was moving to LP DDR4 for the next iPhone and also I understand 2 gigabytes. Do you have an update on your readiness or your roadmap for LP DDR4 when do you think that will be ready?","Mark Durcan","So I think that Mark it is safe to say that we feel pretty good about our position there both existing 25 nanometer LP DDR4, as well as our 20 nanometer LP DDR4 offering. This is lesser about Micron readiness and more about customer demand lining up for the back half of the year and beyond.","Mark Newman","Got it, thanks very much.","Mark Durcan","And it looks like we have time for about one more caller.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John Pitzer","I guess I want to back to some of this idea of building inventory in the May quarter, I am kind of curious why is that now and not sort of accelerating the transition to 20 nanometer more quickly because clearly I would argue if you had 20 nanometer at a larger percent of wafer outs your cost structure would be better, and just can\u2019t remember a time of building inventory either internally or in channel has been a good thing. So I am just kind of curious why the inventory decision is not a faster ramp in 20?","Mark Durcan","John this is Mark. So we talked this quarter about how we were doing exactly what you just mentioned, which was in fiscal Q2, we made some adjustments in our manufacturing line to start positioning equipment for the 20 nanometer ramp. These things always in our balance and certainly the market today is not the market of last year or the year before, we have pretty broad diversification in the segment customers and products where we feel pretty good about our ability to move some stuff overtime, if the market demand is out there this quarter. We don\u2019t know exactly what the market demand looks like this quarter maybe we end up not only anything else, we've left ourselves some room to manoeuvre there. But we\u2019re trying to strike a balance between what you are suggesting as well as just building products and then seeing what the market looks like.","John Pitzer","And maybe on my follow-up just on the OpEx line and specifically the R&D line continuous to kind of creep higher especially R&D kind of independent of revenue levels I am just kind of curious to what extent is this just kind of a new structural norm we should expect in R&D where you go after a lot of different market segments with a lot of different products or would you kind of characterize the current spend is kind of accelerating or elevated because of the where we are in the 3D transition or something else or just the long-term guidance on R&D and OpEx would be helpful?","Mark Durcan","Yes so just on the R&D piece, there are a lot of different dynamics implying here, obviously we've got a lot of new 20 nanometer products that were going to want to qualify and ramp. And so we\u2019re always wanting to make sure that we don\u2019t let the R&D dollar spend getting away with qualifying products on a timely basis and getting to the market, and you just said that we should be doing. So there is that dynamic there is also I think there is an overlying dynamic as we start thinking about some of the storage class memories that we talked about making investments in and as we start continue to add resources to position the company deliver system level products that there is a different nature to the R&D spend than there have been historically as well. Now overtime we may spend less on some of the other things we spend R&D dollars on. But what we are talking about right now in terms of over the next number of quarters being up a little bit. I think it\u2019s more related to some of the short-term dynamic around technology ramps and new product introductions.","Mark Durcan","And with that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

We'll share further details about this event in the coming months.","With that, I will now turn the call over to you, Sanjay.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon. Micron's record first quarter results demonstrated the company's continued strong execution, a market environment that reflects the strategic importance of memory and flash storage and healthy supply and demand fundamentals.","During the quarter, we continue to enhance our cost competitiveness, achieving yield maturity on both 1X DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND. We improved our mix of high value solutions, delivering record SSD revenues and further increasing our SSD shares.","More recently, we began shipping our first 64-layer NAND consumer SSD. We also introduced the industry\u2019s fastest high-density 32GB NVDIMMN, which combines Micron\u2019s DRAM and NAND to deliver a persistent memory solution that addresses intense data analytics workloads. We have garnered solid interest from enterprise and cloud customers, and customer qualifications are underway.","And, we strengthened our talent bench with the recent addition of Manish Bhatia, who leads our global operations. Manish brings extensive experience in managing end-to-end operations and is focused on driving manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies to reduce costs and improve our agility.","Finally, we improved our financial foundation with the retirement of $2.4 billion of debt. I\u2019m pleased with our accomplishments and believe our focus on speed and execution better position Micron to deliver value to our customers and capture the increasing number of end-market opportunities.","I will now discuss trends and results in each of our major markets. Cloud and traditional enterprise data center trends are continuing to drive robust demand for memory and flash storage solutions. Our Q1 SSD revenue to cloud and enterprise customers increased 50% sequentially. We recovered from the flash component issue discussed in our September earnings call that impacted last quarter\u2019s SSD sales.","On the compute side, we had solid sequential DRAM revenue growth into data center markets, driven primarily by enterprise sales. DRAM bit shipments to both cloud and enterprise customers were up by more than 50% year-over-year, underscoring the data center\u2019s growing need for memory and our strong execution in this market. Our 1X nanometer designs have been well received by cloud customers, with more than a quarter of our cloud revenue in Q1 coming from our 1X technology.","Fast qualification and production ramp by our cloud customers of new technology node products is a significant benefit, as it diversifies and accelerates our customer traction and market reach during early stages of production deployment of these advanced nodes. The need to access, analyze, and store data extends well beyond the cloud. This is perhaps most apparent in the mobile market.","Smartphone capabilities have surpassed simple communication and web browsing, they help us navigate, monitor, and interact with the world around us. New cameras capture precious moments with amazing fidelity, and emerging applications like AR have tremendous promise. This increase in functionality is driving the use of higher-capacity memory solutions and increased storage in mobile devices.","These trends, along with our solid execution, drove record mobile revenue in FQ1. We are strengthening our offerings and continue to diversify our portfolio of LPDRAM, MCP, and discrete managed storage solutions to meet the growing needs of our customers. We are accelerating our progress to expand our portfolio of low-power solutions with the release of new products such as our 1X LPDRAM designs. We also shipped initial samples of our 64-layer NAND discrete UFS solution to chipset partners and customers, with very promising results.","Home automation and edge computing devices continue to drive strong revenues in consumer and industrial market segments, which require a wide variety of memory and managed storage products. As more edge devices begin to integrate machine learning and intelligence, we see opportunities to provide higher-performance memory and flash storage solutions in these markets.","We have also seen rapidly growing demand for our graphics products. The graphics market continues to be fueled by the ever-growing popularity of gaming and eSports. Although smaller in size, recent interest in crypto currency mining has put further pressure on graphics memory supply. Our close customer relationships and leading product portfolio helped drive record graphics revenue, up more than 75% year-over-year.","We sampled industry-leading 16Gb-per-second GDDR6 products to key customers and are seeing significant interest in automotive and networking applications that need the high bandwidth this memory provides. We plan to ramp GDDR6 to production in early calendar 2018 for the graphics market, followed by other high-performance applications such as automotive and networking.","The rapid innovation in automotive technology towards autonomous driving continues to create significant demand for higher memory capacities and greater performance. We secured a key design win in an important autonomous driving platform this quarter and are focused on replicating our success to retain our leading share in that market. Automotive customers are moving more rapidly to new memory technologies than they have in the past, and our announcement of the fastest 1X LPDDR4 and GDDR6 products for autonomous driving applications will ensure we continue to support this shift to leading-edge technologies.","We also set record revenues supplying the networking applications that serve data centers and edge devices, as our reputation for consistency and innovation drives strong ties with networking customers. These diversified growth drivers and structural market trends are generating tremendous opportunity for Micron.","We are uniquely positioned in these markets with a broad portfolio of both DRAM and NAND solutions, excellent quality, and comprehensive customer ecosystem engagement. We are focused on developing the right products, deepening our customer relationships, and enriching our revenue mix to capitalize on these opportunities.","Turning to manufacturing and technology, our ability to execute our technology roadmap and drive cost competitiveness are foundational to our ongoing success. In terms of wafer manufacturing plans, we still expect to achieve bit output crossover on 64-layer NAND during the second half of FY2018 and expect to achieve bit output crossover on 1X DRAM by the end of calendar 2018.","We are outfitting our new back-end factory in Taichung, Taiwan, to ramp assembly and test capacity, and expect meaningful output from the facility before the end of the fiscal year. Our capital investments are tracking with our deployment plans, and we are seeing good traction in improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our operations through these investments. Both 1Y DRAM and third-generation 3D NAND development are progressing well, and we remain on track for initial output of both in the second half of calendar 2018.","We continued to make good progress with our 3D XPoint technology. Historically, Micron\u2019s efforts on 3D XPoint have been largely focused on technology development and early manufacturing ramp, but given our increased focus on high-value product solutions, we have recently resourced a product development team to address the opportunity ahead of us.","Simultaneously, we are working with various players in the ecosystem to assess market and enablement opportunities, and we will provide further details of our views regarding these opportunities during our upcoming analyst event. We will also continue to have the opportunity to sell our 3D XPoint output to our partner as this market develops.","Switching to our industry outlook, our supply and demand projections remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. DRAM industry supply bit growth is expected to be about 20% in calendar 2018, and we expect a healthy market environment, driven by the ongoing enterprise data center, cloud, and mobile strength as we just discussed. We expect the industry bit growth for NAND to approach 50% in calendar 2018, as the industry continues to ramp 64-layer designs into volume production.","SSD adoption in client computing and data center applications continues to increase and will expand further as more supply becomes available over time. Against that backdrop, projections for our own bit growth remain unchanged, we expect our DRAM bit growth to be slightly below the industry, and we expect our NAND bit growth to be somewhat above the industry for fiscal 2018.","During fiscal 2018, we are focusing on technology transitions for both DRAM and NAND, without any additions to our total wafer capacity, and on improving our mix of high-value solutions to enhance our revenue share. For fiscal 2019 and beyond, we continue to assess scenarios for the fab clean room space required to implement technology transitions to future, more advanced DRAM and 3D NAND nodes.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ernie to provide details on our first quarter results by business unit.","Ernie Maddock","Thank you, Sanjay. And thanks to all of you for joining the call today. We had a very strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding guidance across all financial metrics, driven by strong execution, a continued robust market environment, and further progress on our technology migrations.","For FQ1, total company revenue was $6.8 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 71% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 55%, up 4 percentage points from FQ4 and 29 percentage points from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 46%, up from 41% in the prior quarter and up 35 percentage points from the year-ago period.","We continue to prudently manage spending with non-GAAP operating expenses totaling $612 million for the quarter, up 2% from FQ4 with both SG&A and R&D remaining relatively flat quarter-on-quarter.","Non-GAAP net income increased to 44% of revenue and totaled approximately $3 billion, or $2.45 per share. This performance compares with $2.4 billion or $2.02 per share in Q4, and $335 million or $0.32 per share from the year-ago period.","Turning to performance by business unit: The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported FQ1 revenue of $3.2 billion, up 13% sequentially and more than double year-ago levels. Our record performance was driven by increasing server memory content, which drove higher sales to enterprise customers together with strong demand for graphics processing. Operating income was 60%, compared to 56% in FQ4 and 14% in FQ1 2017.","Q1 Storage Business Unit revenues increased 7% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by strong growth in SSD sales. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 61%, driven by increasing market share in SSDs. In fact, sales of SSDs reached record levels in the quarter, with double-digit sequential growth across Consumer, Client and Enterprise and Cloud markets. SBU operating margins increased to 29% from 19% in the prior quarter, and negative 5 percent in FQ1 2017. These results reflect a higher value product mix and continued market acceptance of our TLC 3D NAND based products.","The Mobile Business Unit reported $1.4 billion in revenue, up 16% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. We are seeing strong acceptance of our LPDRAM products and continue to enhance our portfolio of managed NAND offerings. The solid demand environment, combined with the traction we\u2019ve made with our latest-generation products, led to operating income of 37%, up from 31% in FQ4 and 9% in FQ1 2017.","The Embedded Business Unit reported revenue of $830 million in FQ1, in line with the prior quarter and up 44% year-over-year. Operating margin was 41%, essentially flat from the prior quarter and up 10 percentage points year-over-year. As Sanjay noted earlier, we continue to see exciting demand trends across each of the underlying embedded markets with evolving end-market requirements ranging from high-performance memory required for autonomous driving, to ultra-high-density storage solutions for edge devices such as video surveillance cameras. We are focused on building upon our existing leadership position to capture these growth opportunities.","Turning to results by product line: DRAM represented 67% of overall company revenue in FQ1. Demand for client PCs, solid exposure to new flagship smartphones, and ongoing strength from servers, particularly in cloud and hyperscale data centers, drove DRAM revenue higher during the quarter, up 13% sequentially and up 88% year-over-year. Sequentially, shipment quantities increased in the upper single-digit range, while ASPs increased in the mid-single-digit range. DRAM non-GAAP gross margin was 61.5% in FQ1, up 2 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 33 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.","Revenue from trade NAND increased by 2% sequentially and represented 27% of overall company revenue in FQ1. Trade NAND revenue was up 47% year-over year, driven by our strong growth and market share gains in the SSD market and robust demand from the mobile and embedded markets. On a sequential basis, shipment quantities increased in the mid-single-digit range, while ASPs declined in the low single-digit range. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margin was 49% in FQ1, up 9 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 26 percentage points from the year-ago quarter, reflecting a richer mix of sales into high-value end markets.","As Sanjay noted in his prepared remarks, we are making strong progress on the roll-out of our 1X DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND deployment. The roll-out of these technologies will enable meaningful levels of ongoing cost-per-bit reduction as we make progress throughout fiscal \u201818. For DRAM, our bit output growth will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year, while NAND bit output growth will be relatively greater in the second half of the fiscal year.","The company generated operating cash flow of $3.6 billion in FQ1, compared to $1.1 billion in the year ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions. We continue to expect FY18 CapEx in the range of $7.5 billion plus or minus 5%, fairly balanced between the first and second halves of the fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion, compared to negative free cash flow in the year-ago period.","We continue to pursue our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and lower debt. During FQ1, we raised $1.4 billion from an equity offering and repurchased or converted $2.4 billion in principal amount of our debt. Total face value of debt was $9.3 billion as of the end of FQ1, and we currently expect to exit FY18 with approximately $8 billion in face value debt. We expect the interest savings from these de-leveraging actions, combined with higher interest income from larger cash balances and the anti-dilutive effects of settling converts for cash, to materially offset the dilutive impacts associated with the equity offering.","Exiting FY18, we foresee non-GAAP net interest expense of $25 million $30 million per quarter versus $100 million per quarter in FQ4 of \u201817. We ended the first quarter with cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash of approximately $6.6 billion and continue to see the opportunity to exit FY18 in a positive net cash position.","Moving on to guidance for FQ2 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Revenue in the range of $6.8 million to $7.2 billion; Gross margin in the range of 54% to 58%; Operating expenses between $625 million and $675 million; Operating income ranging between $3.25 billion and $3.45 billion, and; EPS ranging between $2.51 and $2.65 per share, based on 1.241 billion diluted shares.","Finally, a word about tax reform, as drafted, the legislation would have no significant impact to our FY18 tax rate, which we continue to expect to be in the mid-single-digit range. In FY19 and beyond, we would expect some impact to our non-GAAP tax rate, with an offsetting benefit of more flexibility in deploying our global cash balances. As further clarity around this legislation develops, we will provide appropriate updates.","With that I will turn it back to Sanjay.","Sanjay Mehrotra ","Thank you, Ernie. As we close out calendar 2017 and look to 2018, we see increasing opportunities for Micron to play a larger role in the technology trends shaping modern life. We will be hosting an analyst conference in May, where we plan to elaborate on our view of these trends and how Micron envisions our technologies shaping the world in the years to come.","We believe that our technologies, capabilities, and team talent place us in a unique position in the market. Memory and flash storage are strategic assets that put Micron at the intersection of the biggest growth trends in technology, and we cannot be more excited about our future. Our customers increasingly view us as an essential partner in early design discussions due to the differentiation our solutions can provide. We are focused on increasing this value, and I look forward to sharing the results of that focus throughout 2018.","We will now open for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you and congrats on a great quarter guys. A couple of questions on the NAND side, Sanjay at least among the investor community there seems to be some concerns that there is going to be a flood of supply coming online into the industry in the first half. I am just wondering if you have any thoughts about what your view is about the supply-demand balance as we head into the first half?","And then for Ernie, the NAND gross margin improvement is 900 basis points sequentially, I know you mentioned mix healthy there, but I am just curious if you could provide some more color as to exactly what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable that is going forward?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So in terms of the industry demand-supply environment, let me just say that, with respect to the industry supply growth in the calendar year 2018 we have said that the industry supply growth would be approaching 50%. While that is more than what the calendar year \u201817 supply growth is, it is in the range of 35% to 40%. The overall what you have to look at is the demand requirements.","In calendar year 2017, of course supply has been tight, there has been pent up demand particularly in the areas of client SSDs and the client PC, notebook PC environments. The march toward high density SSDs in notebook PCs was somewhat slowed down given the overall tightness of supply in calendar year 2017.","When I look ahead at calendar year \u201818, I see strong demand trends with respect to attach rate of SSDs and client PCs continue to increase the applications related to cloud and data centers, enterprise data centers continuing to drive higher average capacities usage in cloud and data center applications as well.","And certainly mobile applications also the average capacities of NAND content continue to increase. And these are all increasing because of the trends, right? I mean, attach rate in notebook PCs in calendar year \u201817 about 35%, going toward over the course of next several years by 2020 timeframe getting to 75% attach rates. So lot of HDD that is still to be replaced with SSDs and same trends are continuing in all markets for NAND average capacities are continuing to increase.","So the demand trends continues to be very robust flash, yes, more supply environment. But we are very focus on continuing to strengthen our product portfolio and increased our share with respect to SSD markets as well as with more managed NAND solutions to address the mobile markets. ","Ernie Maddock","And relative to the question about margins, I think there are two pieces of that. One, we are making progress toward a mix -- higher value added mix of solutions and those typically carry the opportunity for higher margins. Also we continue to make progress on the cost side with respect to increasing amount of 3D NAND, as well as TLC and you had a good quarter for cost reduction as well. So it\u2019s a combination of both market facing with the higher value add solutions and a good quarter from an operational perspective relative to costs.","Srini Pajjuri ","Thank you. And then maybe just one follow-up Ernie on the balance sheet, I think you previously said your gross debt target is about $8 billion, which you said you are going to reach I guess next quarter. Given assuming that the tax bill will pass, is there any change to that target? And then if you can talk about again assuming that the tax bill will pass, what\u2019s your priorities for cash going forward?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, I don\u2019t think we have said that we\u2019d reach that gross debt target in FQ2, we said by the end of our fiscal year. And so I wouldn\u2019t expect that we would achieve that level in fiscal Q2. The tax bill, as we understand it would not necessarily change the priorities, which are always to continue to make sure we have the best technology we can in production and to be able to transition that at a time that make sense for us. And then for fiscal year \u201818, certainly getting the balance sheet in shape relative to these aggregate levels of debt.","Srini Pajjuri ","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. On the DRAM side you\u2019ve got Intel ramping sky lake, you have AMD ramping EPYC on the server CPU side, cloud and hyperscale CapEx spending looks to grow about 30% next year. Given all of these, do you guys anticipate continued momentum and mix in your server and cloud business in DRAM to continue to move higher next year? And then from an industry perspective does the server and cloud segment become a bigger part of the DRAM consumption mix over the next two to three years overtaking mobile?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes absolutely, cloud and server, data center enterprise as well as cloud, data centers absolutely will continue to be the biggest growth drivers at large volumes for the DRAM industry and we have very strong penetration in these markets. And actually we do expect to continue to build momentum in these markets going forward.","Harlan Sur","Great, thanks for that. And Sanjay you talked about semi and fully autonomous wins in the quarter. All of the major auto OEMs and subsystem guys are focused on this, we talk to one of the leading guys that focused on sensors and processors technology required for these types of vehicles, they are talking about 25-30 gigabytes of DRAM and 1 terabyte SSDs per car for level 4 and level 5 fully autonomous. That\u2019s a pretty significant step up in DRAM and NAND content, is that consistent with how you see the content trends in automotive over the next kind of three to five years?","Sanjay Mehrotra","It\u2019s absolutely is. I mean, when you look at autonomous vehicles, they really are level 5, autonomous vehicles in the future are projected to have about 40 gigabyte of DRAM content in them. And when you think about it that is very similar to the average capacity that are associated with servers in the server workstations, right. So these cars will be really very powerful computers in the future and they are not only going to be driving tremendous amount of DRAM content usage, but they will also drive NAND flash usage.","They will be generating using data to make millions of real time split second decisions to make sure that the passengers in the autonomous vehicles can be transported effortlessly and safely to their destination. There will be sensors from sonar to cameras that will be generating billions of signals and all of that data will have to be processed, accessed in order to make fast decisions.","So you are absolutely right to note that this is really a secular trend here in front of us in terms of driving continued usage of memory and storage. Earlier we talked about cloud and data center applications and again those are growing faster than the rest of the industry, autonomous vehicles will be another big driver in the future.","Harlan Sur","Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And Micron is uniquely positioned with the strong portfolio of solutions both with its flash solutions as well as DRAM memory solutions to address these fast growing market trends.","Harlan Sur","Thanks, Sanjay. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Blayne Curtis","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and clearly congrats as well. Couple of questions, maybe on DRAM, can you just go back to the servers been a huge driver and that's really been without Intel\u2019s clearly still the minority units. Can you just maybe talk about content per server, how much that increased this year and then as you look into next year how much of the driver is clearly as you look into second half and that being more meaningful?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So in terms of content per server I think 2017 if you look at flash attach rate it's about average capacity around 2,500 gigabytes. And when you look at projection over 2018 timeframe growing to anywhere above 3,000 gigabyte average capacity continue to march ahead by 2021 timeframe almost tripling from the 2017 levels well above 8,000 gigabytes as well.","So that is on the SSD side, and similarly on the DRAM side, average capacity is continue to increase nicely there as well. In 2017 timeframe about 145 gigabyte per server average capacity estimated and industry reports are showing that by 2021 timeframe going to about 350. So, very strong solid and year-over-year increases not just in near-term, but again as I say these are secular trends here.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks for that. And just on the NAND side, I just want to go back that part of question, obviously you are seeing a across over of 64, how do you think about the cost trajectory here as you then start to ramp 3rd gen as you look to the fiscal year is there any sort of -- what's the slop of that costs curve as one is going up and the other one is going down?","Ernie Maddock","As we introduce 3rd generation 3D NAND, we would continue to expect that that technology of mature yield have or has favorable cost dynamics relative to 64 layer. We don't believe that it will have a significant positive or negative impact in our FY18 results as we will just be implementing that as we get into the last quarter of the fiscal year. So, it won\u2019t be material enough either way to change the fundamental dynamics that we're going to see this year, which is largely driven by our 64 layer TLC NAND.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks, Ernie. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Kevin Cassidy","Hi, thanks for taking my question. You had mentioned when you gave your guidance for CapEx for the year about adding more value added into your DRAMs and Flash. Can you say what percentage right now would you call in the value added group and what's the goal for that?","Sanjay Mehrotra","In the value added solutions category we count our SSDs in that and in fiscal Q1 we had really solid increase in our SSD revenues, we gained shares in the market as well. In the mobile space, managed NAND solution are also and discrete NAND solutions, we consider as value add as well. Our share in those markets today is relatively low, low single-digits, but we see tremendous opportunity as we are continuing to diversify our product portfolio. And as we execute on that product roadmap in the quarters to come, we expect to be gaining -- making substantial progress. ","And of course in the DRAM side, applications such as automotive, such as graphics, high performance applications they all contribute toward the value add solution. We are not providing any specifics at this point. We'll discuss more details at our Analysts Day in May.","Kevin Cassidy ","Okay, great. And maybe just as one follow-up is because especially DRAM market had been such a commodity market, are you getting any push back from your customers that they want you to move more towards the commodity?","Sanjay Mehrotra","And let me just point out in response to your previous question that while we will provide more detail in May, but on a year-over-year basis, certainly we are increasing our value-add solution mix substantially and very pleased with the progress that we are making.","Regarding your second question on DRAM, DRAM really is a strategic enabler today in diversity of markets and the mega trends we talked about whether it is data centers, cloud applications being the few for AI engine helping make decisions for various search algorithms as well as various activities in all verticals that are being pursued leveraging AI in mobile space as more and more applications go toward augmented reality type of features in mobile requires more DRAM, DRAM is highly strategic.","Even in the future when you look at notebook computers, they will require the form factor and the low power aspect, even in PCs of LPDRAM in future years to come. So you see and of course we just talked about automotive as well. So now DRAM is addressing diversity of markets, I mean, several large diverse markets product portfolio meeting the needs of these markets is becoming differentiated and when that happens that always gives you stronger opportunities to drive profitable growth in that market.","And our customers when we have an engagement with them, when we have dialogues with them they are talking to us how memory, DRAM memory is really now helping them solve the bottleneck in their applications. So DRAM today is very different, as I said many times before from the DRAM in the PC era only or when it was about just PC and mobile, today it is about many more applications of DRAM. And really providing a very strategic enabling role in creating all these applications that are truly transforming the world right before arrives.","Kevin Cassidy ","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","David Wong","Thanks very much. I\u2019, not sure that you said it, but on the November quarter, how much of your total NAND production was 3D NAND? And as you transition to 64-layer in the February and May quarter next year, did your NAND production drop or grow sequentially?","Ernie Maddock","So about 80% of our output for the quarter just completed was on 3D and over the course of the balance of fiscal \u201818 we would expect that number to grow to about 95%. We expect that we\u2019ll have some measure of bit growth as we said each and every quarter we said it would be in the prepared remarks little more heavily weighted to the back half of the year.","David Wong","But you never let will grow in the first half?","Ernie Maddock","Yes. ","David Wong","Okay, great.","Ernie Maddock","Yes, that output for the quarter was up in the low single-digit range.","David Wong ","Excellent, thanks very much. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. ","C.J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on DRAM, you talked about 20% bit supply for the industry in \u201818, which would suggest continued tightness throughout the whole year. So curious how customers are reacting to that reality, what kind of visibility are you seeing to pricing, as well as extension in contracts?","Sanjay Mehrotra","We work very closely with our customers and we certainly work hard in terms of gaining visibility to their future requirements of DRAM and how their applications are shaping up so that we can make sure that our technology and product roadmap is adjusting their needs. And this varies from customer-to-customer. Some customers tend to be more on a month-by-month basis, some more quarter and some certainly longer term engagements as well.","And you are right to note, that yes, I mean, the industry supply growing about 20% and demand likely to be somewhat higher, we do expect a healthy DRAM industry supply and demand environment and continue to work very closely to drive strategic growth of our revenue mix going forward.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up on the NAND side you are talking around 50% bit growth or approaching that for that industry one or two of the other players in the market are expecting lower type of bit growth. So it would appear that you are making assumptions around the 64-layer ramp that might be a little bit more robust than your competitors. So curious how are you thinking about that ramp? And clearly I think you would agree the risk is probably lower than 50%, how would you kind of I guess put a probability around where you think it truly ends up?","Ernie Maddock","So of course in terms of projecting, our industry bit growth estimates here. We of course are taking into consideration our estimate of the ramp of 64-layer technology in the industry and our assumptions around the ramp of wafer production as well as yield ramp of that technology. And along with other mix of technologies in the industry as well, but you are right to note that the dominant factor of the supply bit growth in the industry will be with 64-layers here.","And we continually look at our estimates and we review it based on all the intelligence that we may have, as well as we may collect from third-party reports we refine our models on an ongoing basis, and if we have any changes on this we will share them with you.","C.J. Muse","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe More with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Joe More ","Great, thank you very much. I wonder I know you don\u2019t want to get too far ahead yourself on this, but when you get to sort of net cash neutral and you get to investment grade, what\u2019s next from a prioritization of free cash flow. And how do you just qualitatively think about cash return versus maintaining cash for a more strategic usage?","Ernie Maddock","I think that we will continue to prioritize the supporting our latest generation technology in production as we talked about for fiscal \u201818 clearly focused on getting aggregate debt down in that $8 billion range. Those things will lead to we believe overtime improved ratings. But I think how we think about deploying cash is not wholly dependent upon the achievement of any particular ratings grade. We just think these are things that will be worked in parallel.","And at the appropriate time I think we are very open to thinking about broader uses of cash including shareholder return programs. So those do have a place in the hierarchy of thinking about uses of our cash. But until we get to the point where we have completed or substantively completed our work on this technology deployment and regaining cost competitiveness and also getting our aggregate debt levels to the -- to a level that we are more comfortable with certainly those will continue to remain our priority.","Joe More ","Great. And then I wonder the disparity between the 60% operating margins in the compute business and mobile which is still quite high, I guess to meet sort of you can see that PC DRAM still quite a bit more profitable than mobile. How do you think about that going forward in terms of your allocation of mix obviously mobile gives you more stability down the road versus the upside that you can get from PCs, how you are thinking about that balance?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, don\u2019t forget that the Compute and Networking Business Unit includes a wide array of products, which includes both clients but also includes data center, mobile -- not mobile but networking and other products as well. So it isn\u2019t just a statement about the client compute environment and many of those sub segments within the Compute and Networking Business Unit we would also consider strategically important these are relationships where we have the opportunity to deploy both DRAM and NAND. And certainly mobile continues to be important. ","So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily presume that the margin performance out of our Compute and Networking Business Unit is largely driven by the performance of clients.","Joe More ","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura\/Instinet. Your line is open. ","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you. Sanjay since some of your equipment, semi cap equipment suppliers have -- it just seems like over the last three months have been raising their spending forecast for 2018 driven impart by higher DRAM investments. So my question is what\u2019s the risk that your competitors perhaps are going more aggressively for share and that the 20% growth assumption you laid out for next year may actually end proving conservative?","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think the gain I would estimate today for DRAM as well are based on all the information from various sources and reports that we gather and we have put that here. I do think that even when you look at that estimates by other suppliers they are all pointing to fairly close tightly aligned industry supply growth estimate here. And -- but this is our estimate, we will as I said before for NAND same thing, we routinely look at this very, very closely.","And just also remember that the technology transitions in the industry today certainly are becoming increasingly complex and they have greater capital intensity, as well as with the advance technology nodes you are actually getting less bits on a per wafer basis even at mature yields compared to prior generation nodes.","Again given the scaling challenges increased complexity. So, all of these trends are actually increased technology complexity and increased capital intensity have a moderating effect on the supply growth.","Romit Shah ","Thank you. And then just on the February quarter, I don't know if you guys look at your individual periods on a seasonal basis, but it seems like the February quarter typically is a down quarter and you are guiding to sequential growth off of a better than expected November period. What's driving the better than normal seasonality for you, is it pricing or other factors as well?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, I think Sanjay mentioned earlier the diversification of the DRAM demand stream and certainly that is also true on the NAND side. And in the context of that diversified demand stream, for example, automobile tend to be far less seasonal than the client PCs and if you look at datacenter deployments among all of the key players there are certainly a specific pattern for customer. But when you put them all together, there is no macro seasonality pattern that emerges when you look at that.","So, as we've transitioned to these diversified demand drivers the concept of seasonality I think has been redefined and is perhaps less impactive on a quarter-be-quarter basis than it may have been in the past.","Romit Shah ","Interesting, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone. Your line is open.","Jagadish Iyer","Thanks for taking my questions. Sanjay, two questions, first, if NAND ASPs continue to decline from rising supply, do you expect cost reduction to keep pace with the ASP decline as we look at fiscal \u201818? And then I have a follow-up.","Sanjay Mehrotra","I mean, we are certainly not projecting pricing for fiscal year \u201818 here. But again what I'll point to you is that if you look at the history of NAND, increased technology capabilities, technology advances which leads to cost reductions ultimately enable opening up of many new market application and drive the elasticity in many of these markets as well and drive the demand environment.","So, I consider it as healthy if the cost declines are greater than the price declines in the industry, that's a healthy industry environment. And while we don't get into the projection of again when we look at all the demand drivers that are ahead of us, I spoke about it repeatedly in the call today multitude of demand drivers and in each of these large market segments again whether it is about could data center, enterprise data center, mobile, smartphones, client notebook, automotive applications all of these are continuing to drive strong demand trends for NAND flash application.","Ernie Maddock","Yes, I think the one thing I would add to that as well as if you think about our statements around industry bit growth which are approaching 50%; those would be associated typically with fairly healthy levels of cost reduction. We're not going to get into the specifics of what that might be. But it is important to remember that that bit growth usually would be accompanied by some good cost reduction as well.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay, fair enough. Then on the 3D XPoint, I was wondering how much are you year marking for spending in fiscal \u201818? And has there been customers who have identified and how should we think generally on a big picture about pricing there? Thank you.","Ernie Maddock","So this is Ernie. The 3D XPoint CapEx and any associated R&D expenses, the CapEx piece is embedded in our non-volatile estimates for the year, which we said was between 35% and 45% of our total spending. And as we look at that product we\u2019re going to have to see how the markets develop, as Sanjay mentioned before we provide any broader perspective on that. ","Jagadish Iyer","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. ","Steven Fox ","Thanks good afternoon. Two quick questions for me, first of all you mentioned the market share gains in SSDs and I assume some of that was related to fixing the component issue, but can you sort of give us some more color on where you think specifically you had most success in gaining share? And then secondly, I know you are not going to talk specifically about pricing for the upcoming quarter, but if you could maybe qualify some more how you get to your sales guidance in terms of pricing and mix that would be helpful. Thanks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","In terms of SSD share gain during the quarter, we believe we gained share both in client applications as well as enterprise and cloud data center applications. Really our products did very well there and at this point our offerings are with SATA drives and next year we will bring out our NVMe solution sometime during calendar year \u201818. And that should help us expand our portfolio and give us opportunities to continue to gain share in this market.","And regarding our guidance that we have given you, of course we have certain assumptions related to total demand and our pricing assumptions are baked in there as well. But obviously for competitive reasons we do not get into discussion of pricing on the call.","Steven Fox ","Understood, sorry give it a shot. Thank you, congratulation.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys, congratulations on the strong results. Ernie maybe I can ask the gross margin question around NAND a little bit differently. I am just kind of curious given that you guys had significant gross margin upside on pricing down low single-digit sequentially under a scenario where pricing continues to decline let\u2019s say at a low single-digit rate sequentially, is there enough mix and cost opportunity for you to maintain and\/or grow gross margins from here. How should we think about the parameters that you being able to maintain or grow gross margins relative to your cost and mix availability from here?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, so if we\u2019re framing the scenario in the future as we continue to see sort of marginally declining pricing environment couple of points per quarter or so I think there is ample room for gross margin expansion both as a result of our cost reduction as well as the ongoing transition to high value solutions, which would include redirecting -- continuing to redirect component sales into higher value added solutions as well as some of our partner contracts wind down over the course of our fiscal \u201818 and into 2019. So I think in that pricing scenario that you have set forth, we believe there is reasonable room for gross margin expansion.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. And a similar question on the DRAM front, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you expect more DRAM bit growth in the first half of your fiscal year than the second half. As we transition into the second half how much -- how many levers do you have on the mix side in DRAM to be able to progress sort of gross margins higher from here?","Ernie Maddock","Yes, I think again the same general story with respect to continuing to move toward higher value add solutions. You heard Sanjay speak too for example increasing the breadth of our managed NAND offerings, if you look at server that certainly a very strong growth pattern here as well as automotive. So I think there are a number of segments where we would continue to expect to be able to optimize our bit output toward, that would give us the best gross margin opportunity. And of course even though our bit output growth is going to be lowering DRAM than NAND we would still expect to deliver some meaningful cost reduction there as I articulated in the prepared remarks.","John Pitzer","Perfect, thanks guys. Congratulations. ","Ernie Maddock","Thanks. ","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our final question from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein. Your line is open. ","Mark Newman","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question on CapEx and capacity. So Micron you stayed top of the CapEx quite a bit this year from previous years, but still quite significant under spending some of the ride was particularly Samsung. My question actually is about, how is Micron thinking about the need for fabs longer term, this is more of a kind of longer term question, because both Samsung and Hynix are building brand new greenfield fabs as we speak. ","What is the status right now for Micron in both DRAM and NAND in terms of how much space you have available to you in DRAM and NAND? And I understand your goal is to keep wafer capacity roughly flat and grow gigabytes from technology migration. At what point do you need more fab space to keep that spread capacity roughly flat as of course more layers requires more fab space and of course as you shrink DRAM you also need more fab space as well. So do you have any plans for new fabs what would be the plan and how you are thinking about that? Thanks. ","Sanjay Mehrotra","So like you noted in order to realize the technology transition you of course do need space in your clean room to deploy the tools that are required to implement the advance technology nodes. So our fabs have had space here in terms of deploying the technology transitions for example in Singapore going from 32-layer to 64-layer and in the past in Singapore fab for NAND going from planer to 3D nodes as well. And similarly clean room space is something we look at very carefully for DRAMs as well because as I just said, I mean, more clean room space is needed for technology transition. ","So as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we do continue to assess the scenarios that are needed for future technology transitions and have continue to assess our clean room space requirements.","Fiscal year \u201818, we are not looking at any new wafer capacity additions, we are not looking at any new -- any meaningful new clean room space required to implement our technology transition plans in fiscal year \u201818. As I said in my remarks going beyond that we continue to assess various scenarios to implement the requirements for technology and transitions both in DRAM as well as in NAND. No plans firmed up yet, and as and when we look at it we will share these things.","Remember any time you build a new clean room it takes several months to build -- construct the building and it takes few months than to roll in equipment into the new clean room and to deploy the equipment, qualify it and build products. So these are things that are to be looked at for the longer term horizon and we are evaluating those scenarios.","Mark Newman","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Good afternoon, everyone.","Micron continues to perform exceptionally well, achieving record revenue and profitability and generating strong operating cash flow in the third quarter. Our focus on structural improvements and consistent execution is driving improved financial performance. First, we are accelerating advanced technology development and rapidly deploying it into production to meet our supply growth and product cost reduction targets. Second, we are broadening our portfolio of high-value solutions to drive increased profitability and strengthen our customer relationships. And third, we announced a capital return program to repurchase up to $10 billion of our shares outstanding starting in fiscal 2019. These initiatives underscore our commitment to enhancing long-term shareholder value.","Turning to our businesses, we delivered strong results across the breadth of our end markets. We were particularly pleased with our mobile business, where we increased revenue by 12% sequentially, setting a new Company record. Revenue from high-value mobile NAND nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, enabled by the ramp of eMMC and eMCP products to multiple smartphone OEMs. 85% of Managed NAND gigabytes that we shipped in FQ3 were lower-cost TLC NAND, as compared to virtually no TLC NAND just one year ago. Memory and storage content per phone continues to rise, creating ongoing demand for our mobile solutions. We are strategically shaping our mobile portfolio to put us in the best competitive position, including the production launch of our 1Y nanometer low-power DDR4 memory and several new 64-layer TLC UFS and eMCP Managed NAND solutions, all later this year.","Data center trends are also driving momentum for Micron\u2019s DRAM and NAND solutions, with combined revenue up 87% year-over-year. In the third quarter, ongoing demand for our memory and storage solutions in cloud computing was a key highlight. Our DRAM and NAND revenue from cloud customers increased sequentially by 33% and 24%, respectively. This performance was enabled by our improving execution, ability to expand share, and strengthening relationships with key customers in this rapidly growing segment.","We stand to benefit from the significant investments cloud service providers are making to build out their IT infrastructure. Cloud CapEx is expected to be $50 billion in 2018, and as we shared during our investor event, analysts project this CapEx to reach $108 billion by 2021.","We achieved record revenue across all market segments of our embedded business, enabled by shifts to higher-value products and continuing healthy demand. Growth was particularly robust in consumer and industrial markets, driven by trends in home and industrial automation, drones, and IoT. We completed qualification of a 64-layer 3D NAND surveillance-grade microSD card, which is designed for smart surveillance deployments that move AI capabilities to edge devices.","We also had notable design-in activity on low-power automotive DRAM and see growing opportunities in the near term for our portfolio of infotainment, dashboard, and ADAS solutions. We readied multiple new products for customer qualification this quarter, including the first 1X nanometer low-power automotive DRAM and a GDDR6 solution for ADAS and autonomous applications. These advanced new products extend an industry-leading portfolio of unique automotive and industrial solutions that, coupled with long-term customer relationships, has helped the Embedded Business Unit deliver consistent profitable growth for Micron.","Overall, we continue to strengthen our product portfolio as we shift our mix away from components and toward high-value solutions. We are outpacing competitors in the high-value graphics market, and our graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year. We also set another Company record in overall SSD sales, increasing our revenue by 37% versus a year ago. We began volume production shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND enterprise SATA SSD and shipped the world\u2019s first QLC-based SSD, a high-capacity drive ideal for read-centric applications like streaming media servers. This QLC SSD is built on our industry-leading 64-layer 3D NAND, utilizing the first-ever terabit NAND die in the industry. As we continue to introduce new SSD solutions on lower-cost, next-generation technologies, we believe that we can unlock new pools of demand that are currently being served by HDDs.","Our technology and operational execution continues to pay dividends. As we recently shared, we achieved yield maturity and production output crossover on our 64-layer 3D NAND ahead of schedule. We still expect to have production shipments on our 96-layer 3D NAND in the second half of calendar year 2018. We are also making good progress on the development of our fourth-generation 3D NAND, which will utilize our novel replacement gate technology.","In DRAM, we are on track to reach bit crossover on our 1X technology and to begin production shipments on our 1Y technology, both in the second half of calendar year 2018. As we noted at our analyst event, we have a strong product and process roadmap for DRAM with 1Z and 1-alpha development programs already underway.","Turning to 3D XPoint technology, as you know, we are partners with Intel in the development and manufacturing of 3D XPoint. As part of that ongoing relationship, we have been discussing the commercial terms of our future-generation 3D XPoint collaboration. Our goal in these discussions is to ensure that Micron has a path to strong ROI for our investments and technology contributions. We will provide updates as appropriate as these discussions progress further.","As we highlighted at our investor day, we are excited about the potential for 3D XPoint technology to create a new tier of memory and storage between DRAM and NAND flash. We remain focused on our 3D XPoint product development and are on track to introduce our first products in late calendar 2019, with meaningful revenue in 2020.","In summary, we continue to see strong market demand for memory and fast storage products due to the value these solutions provide in an economy where data and fast access to that data is increasingly important. Growing capabilities in the data center have enabled greater functionality at the edge, increasing users and creating more data and, in turn, driving opportunities for expanded, higher-value data services. We believe this virtuous cycle has driven the secular growth patterns we are currently seeing across nearly all of our markets and believe that it will persist into the foreseeable future.","I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Dave Zinsner, to provide details on our third quarter results and outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018.","Dave Zinsner","Thank you, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone.","Micron\u2019s relentless focus on execution is evident in our third quarter results. We set new records for revenue, gross margin, operating income, and earnings per share. In addition, we delivered on our goal of achieving a net cash positive position with our cash balance nearly $350 million above GAAP debt position. We are on the strongest financial footing in the Company\u2019s 40-year history, allowing us to make investments that will capitalize on the secular growth trends driven by the data economy.","Our focus on growing high-value solutions, including Managed NAND and low-power DRAM products for the mobile market, SSDs for the cloud market, as well as graphics DRAM, drove our fiscal third quarter results. We also saw the benefit of strong execution on technology transitions. Total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 6% from fiscal second quarter and 40% from the prior year.","Non-GAAP gross margins for the period expanded to a record 61%, up 250 basis points from the prior quarter and up from 48% in the prior year. A robust business environment, more favorable mix, and good execution on cost reductions drove significant gross margin expansion. It is important to note that we were able to achieve record gross margins while we continue to incur underloading charges in advance of volume ramp of our 3D XPoint solutions, which will follow product introductions that are targeted for late calendar 2019. We estimate that these charges impacted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points.","Our record revenue and gross margin performance drove strong profitability in the third quarter. Operating income grew to $4 billion on a non-GAAP basis, representing 52% of revenue. This compares with operating margins of 49% in fiscal third quarter and 37% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $733 million, up approximately 10% from fiscal second quarter and in line with our planned investments in technology and product development. Moving forward, we expect to increase our OpEx from the current run rate, particularly for R&D as we continue to accelerate the development of new products and technologies.","Now, turning to the performance by business unit. We achieved record revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit of $4 billion in the third quarter, up 67% year-over-year and 8% from the prior quarter. Every CNBU business contributed to this growth except the client business, as we directed supply to customers in markets experiencing robust demand. We saw broad-based demand for our memory solutions, with sales of both cloud server and graphics memory products more than doubling year-over-year. Operating income for CNBU increased by 12% sequentially to $2.6 billion or 66% of revenue and more than doubled on a year-over-year basis.","Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit increased to a record $1.8 billion, up 12% quarter-over-quarter and 55% year-over-year. We are experiencing ongoing momentum for our Managed NAND products, with multiple customer qualifications underway for our eMCP solutions. We also continue to see healthy demand for our industry-leading low-power DRAM products. The benefits of shifting more of our supply to these high-value mobile products are evident in our profits. Operating income increased to $860 million or 49% percent of revenue, up from $689 million last quarter and $304 million in the year-ago period.","The Embedded Business Unit continues to deliver solid results, with record revenue of $897 million, up 8% versus fiscal second quarter and up 28% year-over-year. Growth was driven by demand for consumer and industrial applications, including set-top boxes, factory automation, and industrial drones. ADAS and in-vehicle experience applications supported record automotive sales for the quarter. Fiscal third quarter operating income was $386 million, which translates to a healthy 43% of revenue, roughly flat with the prior quarter and up by 600 basis points from the prior year.","And finally, turning to the Storage Business Unit, third quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, which is comprised of SSD, NAND components, and 3D XPoint sales. We continue to build momentum with our SSD portfolio and set a new record for SSD revenue, which now represents over 50% of total SBU revenue. Consistent with our strategy and as we shared at our investor event, we are shifting more of our NAND supply away from components to high-value products such as Managed NAND, which are targeted for our mobile and embedded markets, as well as SSDs. This shift to NAND supply and lower 3D XPoint sales to our partner resulted in a 9% sequential decline in our Storage Business Unit revenue.","The underutilization costs associated with 3D XPoint production that I previously mentioned had a negative impact on SBU operating margins of approximately 700 basis points in the third quarter. Our resulting SBU operating income was $156 million or 14% of third quarter revenue, compared with 20% in fiscal second quarter. Today, a majority of our SSD sales are based on 32-layer 3D NAND. As Sanjay pointed out earlier, we are starting to ramp SSD solutions built on our 64-layer 3D NAND, initially targeting consumer and cloud customers. Our SBU cost structure will benefit from this transition to lower-cost 64-layer SSDs.","Moving to performance by product line, DRAM represented 71% of total Company revenue in fiscal third quarter. DRAM revenue was up 6% from the prior quarter and 56% year-over-year, reflecting strong execution on our strategy and a robust market environment. ASPs increased in the mid-to-upper single digit percentage range, supported by broad-based demand and a richer mix of high-value sales, including server and graphics DRAM products. Shipment quantities were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. And our resulting non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in fiscal second quarter and 54% from the year-ago quarter.","We achieved $1.9 billion in trade NAND revenue, representing 25% of total Company revenue for the fiscal third quarter. Trade NAND revenue was up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year, reflecting healthy demand for our products. While on a like-for-like basis, NAND pricing declined modestly sequentially, our overall NAND ASP increased in the mid-to-upper single-digit percentage range, driven by a richer mix of high-value solutions in our NAND portfolio. We ramped eMCP solutions to our mobile customers, which tend to carry higher ASPs relative to other NAND products. Trade NAND shipment quantities remained relatively flat compared to the prior quarter. And trade NAND gross margins were 47% on a non-GAAP basis, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter and up 600 basis points from the year-ago quarter.","Our solid execution and healthy industry environment led to record non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15, up 12% from the prior quarter and 94% from the prior year.","We generated $4.3 billion in cash from operations, representing 55% of revenue. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was $2.1 billion in the third quarter. We expect the full fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be approximately $8 billion, which includes previously discussed investments associated with our cleanroom expansions in Singapore and Hiroshima.","Our resulting free cash flow was $2.2 billion, flat with the prior quarter and nearly double that of the year ago period.","We ended the quarter in a net cash positive position with approximately $7.7 billion in cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash, and $7.3 billion in GAAP debt, including approximately $300 million of incremental debt incurred in third quarter by our jointly owned 3D XPoint fab. We are very pleased to have achieved a net cash positive position one quarter earlier than we had originally committed. We reduced our gross debt position by approximately $2 billion in FQ3, and we expect to reduce our debt by another $2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter.","We also used $1.1 billion in cash in the third quarter to settle the debt and equity components of our convertible notes. In addition, we received another $550 million of convertible note redemptions in the third quarter, which we will cash settle early in the fourth quarter. Combined, these convert notices equate to roughly a 20 million share count reduction.","This is a great start to our strategy of reducing our fully diluted share count, which we expect will continue in fiscal 2019, when we begin utilizing at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase shares under our $10 billion share repurchase authorization.","Turning to non-GAAP guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter. The market for our products continues to be robust, and we are executing well on our strategy. We therefore expect sequential revenue growth again in the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.4 billion; gross margins to be in the range of 59% to 62%. Operating expenses are expected to be $750 million, plus or minus $25 million. And based on a share count of approximately 1.23 billion shares, these results should drive EPS of $3.30, plus or minus $0.07.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Dave.","We recently introduced our vision for the New Micron. We have been undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by changes in our markets, our industry, and within our Company.","Starting with our markets, data-hungry applications are driving secular growth for memory and storage solutions. Importantly, our customers recognize the essential added value that memory and fast storage provide for the solutions they deliver to their end customers.","Second, the industry we operate within is structurally different than in the past. Technology transitions require more CapEx and provide less bit gain, and the pace of those transitions has slowed, given increased process complexities. The result is a more consistent and stable supply-demand outlook. These structural changes have also resulted in improved ROI over the last several years.","Finally, a laser-sharp focus on executing our strategic business objectives has allowed Micron to better capitalize on our excellent technology portfolio, product breadth, manufacturing scale, customer reach, and deep team expertise. We are creating a culture of increased urgency, crisp execution, and accountability that will enable us to consistently deliver against these strategic objectives and create positive results for all stakeholders.","We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Romit Shah","Okay, thanks. And thanks for leaving the guidance at the end of the presentation that really kept us on our seat here. Great results. I had a question about NAND pricing. The like-for-like pricing, you mentioned in NAND was down modestly. And based on guidance, it seems like the NAND business as well as DRAM will be healthy again in August. There has been, I would say several reports about your largest competitors seeing significant ASP weakness in their NAND business. And I\u2019m just having a hard time trying to reconcile why Micron isn\u2019t seeing this weakness as well.","Dave Zinsner","Yes. I think, I won\u2019t comment on the fourth quarter guidance and what\u2019s built into it. But, I think right now what you\u2019re seeing is a pretty healthy mix of the higher value solutions. We\u2019re getting increasingly a higher mix of that component into our NAND -- into our NAND business. And that\u2019s really helping keep the pricing healthy.","Romit Shah","You did say though that even absent mix that seems like NAND pricing was down far less than it was in the prior quarter. Correct?","Dave Zinsner","Yes.","Romit Shah","Okay. So, again, kind of the same question. How do we reconcile the performance that the NAND business and pricing like-for-like it seems like the ASP declines are fairly modest with what seems to be bigger and broader weakness from some of your competitors?","Dave Zinsner","Well, I think, in one case, in the second quarter when you look at the pricing, there was a bit of an aberration, I guess I\u2019d call it, given that we had in the first quarter a higher ASP lift as it related to kind of onetime MLC sales. So, actually think when you strip that out, if we had done it like-for-like. I don\u2019t think we made a comment on that in the second quarter. You would have found that those ASP declines were relatively modest as well.","Romit Shah","Okay. And if I could just follow up\u2026","Sanjay Mehrotra","I just want to point out that as Dave said in his remarks that the mix of our NAND business has improved substantially, given successful execution on our strategy of shifting our products toward high value solutions. And multichip packages which have both NAND and DRAM and carry higher ASPs, on a sequential basis, we doubled our sales of those solutions in the market. And of course we did well on SSD as well, which hit a record. So, all that mix really drove our strong performance on the ASP front for the NAND business.","Romit Shah","Okay, great. And then, just as a follow-up, I noticed for both DRAM and NAND, there really wasn\u2019t much bit growth for each of those businesses. Are you still comfortable with your bit growth targets for both DRAM and NAND for calendar \u201818? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes. We are comfortable with our targets. As we said, we are proceeding well with our 64-layer transition into production, actually achieved bit output crossover one quarter earlier than planned, and on the DRAM side continued to do well with our 1X nanometer technology transition, which we said will have bit output crossover by the end of the calendar year, and similarly good progress in terms of our 1Y nanometer DRAM. So, yes, with respect to our overall bit growth target for the year as we have said that we believe that the industry will be in the range of 40% to 45% for NAND and will be somewhat higher, that remains the case. And with respect to DRAM, we have said in calendar year 2018, industry supply bit growth will be approximately 20% and will be in range and that stays the same as well.","I\u2019ll just point out that in FQ3, our -- the supply -- the shipment growth being flat for DRAM and NAND, as you were questioning that really is just related to the normal ebb and flow of the business in terms of qualifications of our products in those new technology nodes as well as ramp up in production of those technologies.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on gross margins and if we take the midpoint down just a smidge Q-on-Q. So, curious, should we be thinking about changes to mix on both DRAM and NAND as driving that or perhaps a slowdown in cost down, given some of the challenges ahead with 64, 96, 1Y et cetera? I would love to hear your thoughts on that.","Dave Zinsner","Yes. Well, we probably won\u2019t get into too much detail about our guidance, other than to say we did give a range, the high end of the range is 62%, so that would actually be an improvement from this quarter. So, that\u2019s certainly a scenario and that would encompass a more robust mix of higher margin products for sure. And this is somewhat mix dependent business. And so, we factor in that that might happen and that creates a bit of a range for us. I wouldn\u2019t look too much into the fact that the midpoint is slightly below.","C.J. Muse","Okay. I was just trying to get more color on the mix. So, thanks for that. I guess, larger picture question for DRAM, in the last few months we\u2019ve heard about real-time push-outs of select capacity, which I think is the first when the industry is enjoying such margins, as you are today. So, I guess, can you speak to I guess this new rational profitability focused market and would love to hear kind of your thoughts for the market today and into year-end and beyond?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, we just said that at length at our investor day and as we highlighted, the markets today are structurally different compared to ever in the past. For us, they\u2019re ever more diversified. Markets are not just about DC and DRAM. I mean, data center is driving large growth for DRAM. The AI trends, which we are very, very early innings of requires more and more DRAM in order to really perform high performance competition that AI applications rely on. So, driving -- AI applications are driving growth in the data center as well as through more intelligent devices on the edge. And smartphones, certainly where features such as AR and VR and AI getting implemented into these phones, along with all the high resolutions cameras, they require more and more DRAM as well. So, the demand drivers are diverse. They\u2019re secular in the nature. Memory has become essential in terms of delivering the value proposition of the end market applications. So, this is what is really driving the overall robust demand drivers for our industry for DRAM. And whether it\u2019s in data centers or in mobile or in graphics or automotive applications, all of these need more memory. And memory is now really enabling higher value as well to the end market applications. So, yes, this all bodes well for the long-term healthy industry fundamentals. And all of this reflects in our guidance as well, which speaks for itself. It\u2019s a very robust strong guidance that we have provided for the third quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Dave, I guess, my first question just revolves around the profitability levels in the SBU. Just kind of curious, when you think about underutilization charges for XPoint, have those now peaked on sort of a quarterly basis or how should we think about that? And you mentioned in your prepared comments that the move from 32 to 64 should help profitability there. I guess, just as we think longer term, notwithstanding what you\u2019re selling to Intel at sort of cost, how do we think about the long-term operating margin trajectory of this business compared to your other business units?","Dave Zinsner","So, just going back to the prepared remarks, the underutilization charge associated with 3D XPoint was about 700 basis points, as it hit to the SBU operating margins. We sold very little of 3D XPoint to our partner. And so, it certainly was a relatively high level. Hard to say, if this is indeed the peak, but it\u2019s certainly close to the peak if not the peak. I think, longer term from underutilization perspective, we could continue to sell wafers to our partner, and that certainly would mitigate the underutilization charges. So, I wouldn\u2019t dismiss the likelihood of that happening. And then, on top of that, as Sanjay mentioned earlier in the call, we are expecting 3D XPoint products towards the end of calendar year 2019 and will ramp into 2020. And that certainly will help improve the underutilization aspect of this thing, and have that go away. Having said that, we are looking to try to improve the cost structure of the storage business unit; and certainly as we transition more and more of the wafers from 32-layer to 64-layer, that will have a meaningful improvement to the cost structure of SBU.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And I\u2019ll just point out that it\u2019s only a very short period of time, just a few quarters. So, we eventually we have really driven tremendous momentum in our SSD sales and SBU. And yes, they are mostly 32-layer driven but 64-layer is starting to ramp. And as we focus on bringing our next generation of products into the market with our -- such NVMe solutions as well as more 64-layer based solutions for cloud applications, that will help improve the cost structure and certainly will bode well for the health of our SBU business going forward. So, we are very excited about the opportunities, about our very cost-effective NAND die and technology, and very focused on continuing to accelerate our product introductions and get the benefit of advanced technology nodes as well as the reduce the overall cost of SSD builds, because you know that in SSDs, there is more than just memory that goes into building SSD. So, we are extremely focused on all of those. And that bodes well for the cost structure of our SSD solutions as well as growth of the SSD business.","John Pitzer","And then, Sanjay as my follow-up, I know that you guys have sort of rightfully tried to get away from giving us quarterly bit growth and cost down projections for DRAM and NAND. But, I wonder more generically, as you think about for DRAM, the transition to 1X and NAND, the transition to 64 layers, which quarter do you think you are going to get the maximum benefit? Is there more of a benefit in the August quarter or is it more of the November quarter? How should we think about that for both DRAM and NAND?","Sanjay Mehrotra","In terms of cost, we are continuing to ramp our -- in DRAM, our 1X technology into production. And as we said in the latter half of this year, we will achieve the bit crossover. And then that 1X technology node will continue to ramp into production even during the course of next year, just like our 20-nanometer ramp for several quarters as well. So, that will on an ongoing basis continue to provide us cost benefits. And same story on the NAND side. We are focused on continuing to go beyond bit crossover, the 64-layer now, to continue to increase the mix of 64-layer technology to production. And then, as we ready our 96-layer technology, which in my prepared remarks I said, we will be having in the second half of this year, as we ramp that up, it will then continue to provide additional cost benefits on an ongoing basis. So, you really can\u2019t say, which quarter is the cost reduction peaking. In general this is gradual over the course of future quarters.","And please do not forget, when I\u2019m talking about NAND here, I\u2019m talking about the NAND technology level cost reduction capabilities. Of course NAND cost is also a function of mix. I mean MCP solutions tend to carry the cost of the DRAM in them as well. So, they tend to be highest cost when you measure it as a cost per gigabyte of NAND and similarly SSD solutions because they have other cost, also tend to be higher cost. So, don\u2019t confuse the reported cost changes quarter-over-quarter with the underlying technology capability of cost reduction. The mix plays the role in reported margin numbers that you talk about.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. ","Joe Moore","I wonder if you could talk about the capital spending. You talked about the low 30s as a percentage of sales. Obviously, sales are coming in lot better than at least I expected this year, and you\u2019ll be in the sort of high 20s. So, low 30s comments mean you think your sort of spending less than you want this year and just any indications you can give us on what that means for next year?","Dave Zinsner","I mean, the low 30s is more of a longer-term model. Clearly, some years will be under the low 30s, some years we might be a little bit above the low 30s. This is a very robust year from a revenue perspective. And we had a plan where we wanted to make investments, both in DRAM and NAND, plus cleanroom space we talked about in Hiroshima and Singapore, and then also some investments, capital investments in our R&D organization. And so, I think the fact that we had a bit more revenue and we had an opportunity to make some more investments, we did take advantage of that this year. But clearly, it\u2019s below our model.","I\u2019d tell you next year, which I\u2019m assuming Joe is real source of your question is try to figure out what next year might look like. I don\u2019t know the exact number yet. I mean, we\u2019re still working up the operating plan for next year. I think Sanjay in his discussions with all of you at the analyst day made a great point about the capital intensity of these businesses going up, which is why we thought the low 30s as a percent of revenue made sense. And so, I think if you wanted to make a guess, you certainly suggest the CapEx will be up next year. The magnitude of that and exactly how that would all break down, I think is yet to be determined by us. And we will go through the process this quarter in a very granular fashion, make sure we\u2019re getting good ROI on everything, every dollar we put into CapEx. And then, I think at the end of the fourth quarter when we\u2019re providing guidance, we\u2019ll give you a specific number in terms of CapEx.","Joe Moore","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I wonder if you can -- there has been a bunch written about antitrust concerns here. It is not obvious to me that there would be any. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide any context around those articles or those things.","Sanjay Mehrotra","We can\u2019t really comment much on it, other than the authorities in China had visited our offices and had on May 31, I believe it was, and had requested certain information. And of course we are cooperating with that. And I would just like to point out that we absolutely do remain focused on -- disciplined and operating with highest integrity methods.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Blayne Curtis","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious, in DRAM, you saw nice uplift in ASPs. I think, you\u2019ve seen the pricing in the market, or at least it was swapped, pricing come down. I was curious, little more color on that mix that helped you there. I think you mentioned servers and graphics, just curious your outlook for those segments as you look into the second half of the calendar year.","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think, servers and graphics, we continue to see growth, strong growth in those areas. And again, these are long-term trends. As we described earlier that cloud and all the billions of devices on the edge, all of them becoming more intelligent and trends of AI are absolutely driving more and more demand. We had shared at the investor day, for example AI driven, AI training driven compute workloads have like 2x the amount of DRAM and 6x the amount of SSD. So, these trends are really secular in nature. We are at the very, very beginning. And same way in mobile in terms of our low power DRAM where we have very strong position, DRAM contents requirements are going -- continuing to increase. And certainly graphics in console and gaming as well as some crypto driven demand continues to be overall long term strong trend as well.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks. And then, maybe just a question for Dave, I just wanted maybe a clarification, just on the NAND. ASPs were up with mix. It looks like costs were up. And I just wanted to make sure is that just a function of selling more higher value parts and modules and such, just curious.","Dave Zinsner","Yes. You\u2019re right. Sanjay even mentioned that the mix of multichip products in the mobile was very healthy this quarter and they do have a NAND and a DRAM component. Their ASPs are very high. They\u2019re margin accretive, I would point out, but the cost is actually higher. So, the cost and ASPs did go up. But it did expand the margins on the NAND side by about 50 basis points.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you. And let me echo my congrats as well. I guess, Sanjay, just a quick question on the server demand that you talked about. You said data center DRAM and NAND grew 87%. I can see why the NAND business is outgrowing the market, but I\u2019m just curious, you seem to be outgrowing DRAM overall server demand, server market as well. So, I\u2019m just curious as to what\u2019s driving those share gains, if you can comment on that. Then, I have a follow-up.","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think our strong execution with our products is enabling us to really broaden and deepen our reach with our cloud customers. And over the course of last few quarters, in cloud where we used to be under represented with respect to our total shares, when you look at our total share of the DRAM industry and you look at cloud, we used to be under represented but with strengthening execution, our share has increased and is in line with rest of the overall DRAM industry share. So, it is really sheer execution on our product roadmap, our ability to work closely with those customers to understand the requirements in terms of the technology, in terms of the product and certainly understanding them in terms of supply as well and being able to fulfill their requirement successfully. This is an important area of focus for us. And I am very pleased with the performance of the Company, both on the DRAM side as well as on the NAND side in this growth market.","Srini Pajjuri","And then, maybe for Dave. Dave, on the CapEx, the low 30% CapEx guidance that you talked about, you talked about expanding cleanroom, both in NAND as well as in DRAM. I believe it was 10% in DRAM and 35% in NAND. I guess, if you assume that the NAND and DRAM bit growth will sustain at the current levels when do you think you\u2019ll need more cleanroom space? And whenever that is, what are the implications for the CapEx?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Difficult to predict when we would need additional cleanroom space. Obviously these node transitions are requiring more footprint, more floor space as we move increasingly to more and more higher technologies. And so, I am not sure I could predict exactly when we\u2019ll need that. What we\u2019re trying to do is carefully build supply consistent with what Sanjay indicated as our long-term expectations around industry growth rates.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","I guess, two for me as well. First, the 100 basis-point headwind that you mentioned from 3D XPoint that\u2019s impacting you in May quarter, how do I think about that number in August quarter? What do you have baked into your guide with regard to that number and when do you see that getting to a neutral level essentially?","Dave Zinsner","As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s roughly in the same range for next quarter, assuming that we do not sell any 3D XPoint to our partner. I wouldn\u2019t rule that out, as I said before, and that could happen in any quarter or multiple quarters quite honestly where we do sell product to our partner. And that would certainly reduce or mitigate that underloading charge. Absent that, I think the expectation is, as I mentioned that 3D XPoint products would start to be introduced in late calendar 2019 and the expectation is they would start to ramp shortly thereafter. And we\u2019ll start to see the benefits of that in terms of bringing our underutilization charges down over time.","Amit Daryanani","And then, if I could just follow-up, cloud server demand, especially the hyperscale side has been fairly robust for you guys, I think it\u2019s across DRAM and NAND both. And I understand all the medium to long term dynamics that you guys have outlaid. But in the near term, I guess, is there a concern that perhaps some of the strength you have seen these customers prebuying or buying ahead and you may see a period of digestion over the next couple of quarters as a use for the capacity they\u2019ve taken up. So, I guess from where you sit, do you have visibility and comfort that whatever you have shipped into these hyperscale OEMs is getting used and absorbed and not just prebuying on that -- from their end?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, as I pointed out earlier, we work closely with these customers and really are building strong relationships across the board. We do not see trend of building or holding product. We don\u2019t see that. I mean we -- the demand in cloud applications has continued to increase. You have heard cloud operators, the major cloud operators increased their CapEx in Q1, calendar Q1 \u201818 over Q4 \u201817, by more than 20%. And on a year-over-year basis in calendar Q1, CapEx spend by major cloud holders increased by -- cloud operators increased by over 100%. So, this -- and of course meaningful part of that total cost CapEx from cloud operators is certainly going towards compute and storage and memory. And we are playing a good role in terms of supporting the needs of those customers. So, no, we do not see these trends. We work closely in assessing overall their demand requirements and expectations. And keep in mind that this is a global trend in terms of cloud data centers growth and there are several large operators around the world. And we are well engaged with most of them. So, if ever, there is any pause from any one of them, it doesn\u2019t overall matter because the total trend is one of continuous growth. Again, given the value that memory and fast storage brings to the end market applications that these cloud providers are enabling for consumers as well as for businesses.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Given the normalization in NAND pricing, is the team starting to see price elasticity effects starting to kick in? In other words as you guys work with your customers on their second half product launches, are you seeing SSD attach rates and notebook PCs increasing and are you seeing more content per application in areas like smartphones and IoT devices?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes. Certainly, we do see that average capacities of NAND continue to go up in smartphones, we discussed that at the investor day as well, and certainly for DRAM keep going up as well. In the high end smartphones, 6 gigabyte DRAM is being used. And that average capacity over time, even phones getting introduced in the future with 8 to 10 gigabyte, even 12 gigabyte. And similarly on the smartphone side, certainly average capacity of NAND content is continuing to increase nicely. I think at investor day, we had pointed out that there is a smartphone introduced in China that has in fact a terabyte of flash content. So, average capacities are continuing to increase. And yes, certainly, with the benefit that 64-layer technology has brought to the industry in terms of enabling lower manufacturing cost certainly is enabling content growth, not only in the mobile market but also in SSDs. And last year in SSDs, somewhat average capacity growth had somewhat stalled, given the supply constraints that existed last year. And now with the benefit of 64-layer, certainly average capacities are expected to continue to increase over the course of next several years. And yes, replacing HDDs as well both in client computing application as well as in enterprise applications with increasing attach rates and average capacity increases as well.","Harlan Sur","And there has been some reports of your competitors struggling on advanced DRAM node transitions. Sanjay, can you just confirm that the Micron team is -- you guys are hitting your cost per bit targets at the 1X nanometer node? What do the initial yield and manufacturabilities look for as a team? And then as you ramp initial production volumes of 1Y in the second half of this calendar year, can you just talk about also your ability to hit your cost targets and manufacturability targets? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, we\u2019re executing very well on our 1X as well as 1Y technology for DRAM. I think, we had already indicated that how on 1X DRAM technology we had RAM to mature yield much faster than the previous generation technology note and we have talked about that on 1X, we are on track to achieve bit output crossover in our supply in second half of this year. So, we\u2019re absolutely on track there and very pleased with the progress on 1Y technology node in DRAM as well, which we will begin production of in the second half of this year, of course following customer qualifications.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Karl Ackerman","I had a follow-up to last question. So, it is widely reported that one of your competitors is struggling with yields on not just 1X but also 1Y. So, do you still expect to have 10% of wafers out on 1Y this calendar year? And I guess, would you expect to have a more measured pace of the capacity expansion plans or perhaps is your guidance for fiscal \u201818 capacity expansion plans in part, acknowledging some of this pause from the 1Y yield ramps or yield learning on 1Y? And I have a follow-up, please.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, I don\u2019t think we have stated the core in terms of our 1Y technology mix. What we have said is that in the second half of this year we will begin production of this technology following customer qualifications. Of course that will then ramp up gradually over period of time. And of course we will be then focused on ramping up the production yields of the technology as well. I think, you\u2019re confusing the 10% with what we have said regarding the Hiroshima space expansion. What we have said is we\u2019re expanding the cleanroom space in Hiroshima by 10% in order to implement the 1Y transition of the install capacity there. That does not mean that we will have 10% of our DRAM production in 1Y technology. That is not the case. So, I hope I clarified that with you. But as I said earlier, we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making with our 1Y technology development and really pleased with the execution focus of our entire team on accelerating our technology development and focus on deploying these technologies into production in order to enable us to catch up on the cost competitiveness in the industry.","Karl Ackerman","Fair enough. I tried my luck on 1Y. Perhaps more of a longer term discussion. So, there are several new memory fabs announced in China in Yangtze Memory I think seems to be the furthest along. While it appears these indigenous fabs may struggle near-term to access IP beyond lagging edge NAND technologies, thus limiting any real impact on supply, I was curious to hear your thoughts on how you think about the opportunity to sell supply agreements to indigenous Chinese companies in exchange for perhaps large upfront prepayments that could be used for both investment and capital return. Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Again, as we have said, we are focused on executing to our strategy in terms of accelerating technology development and cost competitiveness and executing well on our products. We see strong demand trends for our products in our end markets, in the well-diversified market that we have talked about. So, I think this is what we\u2019re focused on and this is the best way for us to focus on high ROI, return on our investments, and that\u2019s our focus here.","Operator","Thank you. Our question will come from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question for me. You guys early in the call mentioned multiple qualifications were underway on the eMCP products. I was curious if you could put a little color around that and whether you\u2019re referring to the rest of this year, into next year, and maybe types of customers, geographic regions et cetera that you may be seeing most demand from.","Sanjay Mehrotra","With respect to eMCP, we are engaged with a broad set of customers in terms of getting our products qualified. The shipments that we have made with respect to eMCP are with 32-layer. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re also focused on qualifying 64-layer based eMCP products. And just will like to point out that along with eMCP products, we are of course also focused on qualifying our 64-layer based UFS and MMC products with our customers as well and seeing good traction there. This is all part of our strategy of shifting our portfolio toward high-value solution. Having both DRAM and NAND in those eMCP solutions gives us a unique capability to provide a strong value proposition to our customers. And of course, these solutions are also, as we pointed out in our embedded markets, automotive markets. So, there is a broad set of customers that we are engaged with for our eMCP and discrete Managed NAND solutions.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Vijay Rakesh","Hi, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. Good quarter and good guide. Just one question. As you look at the 96-layer and 1X, can you talk about what kind of cost reduction you see once it gets to steady levels?","Sanjay Mehrotra","We do not provide cost reduction for these technologies. For competitive reasons, we don\u2019t disclose that. But, I can tell you that in NAND, if you look at our track record and Micron\u2019s capabilities of CMOS under the array we have produced the smallest die in the industry with our 3D NAND. And on the DRAM front, we are continuing to focus on bringing in next generation technology nodes to narrow the cost gap that we have currently in the industry. And we are making very good progress as you can see in our results of FQ3 as well as in our guide of FQ4; we\u2019re making very good progress on all those fronts.","Vijay Rakesh","Last question here on the -- when you look at the second half, obviously first half has been very strong. As we go to the half, where do you see inventory levels in both DRAM and NAND?","Dave Zinsner","So, inventory, as you probably noticed, was up a little bit this quarter. I\u2019d point out that finished goods inventory was actually down by about $50 million. It was all up in whip and that was driven by this crossover on 64-layer and the ramp up of the 1X technology that drove the inventory up. Early to make a prediction on next quarter, but maybe what I\u2019d tell you more holistically is as Manish talked about in the analyst day, we really are looking at inventory and intend to make good progress on just refining our ability to manage with lower days. So, that\u2019s kind of our goal. But, that\u2019ll happen over time.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session today.

Mark?","Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. I would like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter, followed by a few strategic and industry thoughts. I will then turn it over to Ron for financial summary. Before turning to Q&A, we will close our prepared comments with Mark Adams covering additional details of our operational performance and market conditions.","Fiscal Q1 was our first full quarter with combined Micron and Elpida financials. Elpida's financial performance met or exceeded the high end of the range for the key estimates we provided in early August. The early execution of our combined teams has been impressive and in conjunction with favorable market trends, our financial results were outstanding.","We achieved record quarterly revenue of over $4 billion, improved our gross margin to over 7 percentage points, and delivered very strong earnings performance. Operating cash flow was $1.5 billion and CapEx was $669 million, resulting in free cash flow of $838 million.","We are focused on a capital allocation strategy to maximize long-term shareholder returns. With this in mind, we recently entered into a series of transactions to restructure our existing convertible debt and address the dilutions stemming from those converts which Ron will describe in more detail later. We will continue to focus on optimizing our capital structure.","Although we had a head start on planning and technology development, we are still in the relatively early stages of the Elpida integration activities which are going very smoothly. In particular, we are very pleased with the 25-nanometer ramp execution of both Hiroshima and Rexchip fabs, this positions us at the leading edge in terms of industry technology.","Our outlook for memory industry conditions remains very favorable. In terms of DRAM, the fire at Hynix Wuxi fab last fall coupled with what was a healthy supply demand situation beforehand is resulting in significant reductions in inventory across the DRAM supply chain, in particular for the PC and mobile segments. Our belief is that this tight and further declining inventory situation coupled with balanced long-term production and demand to continue to drive healthy market conditions. We will continue to monitor the market and make the best supply allocation decisions for our long-term margin profile.","We expect to see the DRAM industry wafer production down about 5% in 2014 with total DRAM industry bit supply up in the mid-20% range. Micron's total DRAM bit production, including Elpida, will be well below the industry for the calendar year at about the mid-teens year-over-year given our DRAM to NAND conversion activity. Beyond 2014, we expect industry capacity to remain relatively stable. For Micron, any potential decision to add capacity in DRAM is not just about current profitability levels which while good are still below the long-term average that we believe justify the significant investments in R&D and process technology required in the business.","In addition to attractive long-term returns on the existing asset base, we would need to see a fundamental and significant upward shift in bit demand consistently above approximately 40% compared to the current CAGR in the low 30% range before it would make sense for us to bring on additional wafer output. As such, in the current environment, we believe the best strategy for Micron is to continue optimizing existing capacity for improved gross margins.","For NAND, we are projecting industry supply growth in the low 40% range for calendar 2014. This includes a 10% increase in industry wafer production with the remaining supply growth coming from technology. Micron's total NAND supply growth was below the industry in 2013 but it will be slightly above the industry in 2014, given our DRAM to NAND conversion. This supply forecast compares to the five-year NAND bit demand CAGR in the low-to-mid 40% range implying favorable long-term supply and demand balance. Our emphasis in NAND is on continuing to improve customer enablement and product placement and value-added applications.","We are very pleased with the results for the quarter and the outlook for a healthy memory industry dynamics. We remain focused on optimizing value for our shareholders and worldwide customers in 2014 and beyond, and I will stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before turning it for Q&A. Ron?","Ron Foster","Thanks, Mark. Our first quarter of fiscal 2014 ended on November 28. To ensure you have easier access to the materials we are covering today, we\u2019ve posted to our website a file containing these financial informations I will cover, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the first quarter, as well as guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2014.","For the first quarter, we reported net income of $358 million or $0.30 per diluted share on record net sales of $4,042 million. These results include the unanticipated costs of the Rambus settlement and debt restructuring. As a reminder, the results for the previous quarter included the $1.5 billion non-operating gain recognized as part of the purchase accounting for the Elpida acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $881 million or $0.77 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments totaled $523 million or $0.47 per share.","Key adjustments included the following; a $233 million charge recognized on the Rambus settlement which was expensed entirely in the first quarter, $111 million non-cash flow through of Elpida inventory step up related to the acquisition, $92 million in accounting losses recognized on the convertible note transactions, a portion of which resulted from mark-to-market accounting and our improved share price in the last month of the quarter. Approximately $17 million of this amount was recorded as interest expense for the make whole premiums on the notes. Q1 adjustments also included $50 million in non-cash amortization of debt discounts and other costs. This primarily consists of the imputed interest on the convertible notes and Elpida installment debt, $73 million in non-cash taxes related to the Elpida operations in the quarter, and finally $54 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the first quarter of $17.48.","In the second quarter, we expect the following non-GAAP adjustments. Around $30 million flow through of Elpida inventory step up reported as a higher cost of goods sold in Q2. This should be immaterial in future periods, approximately $50 million amortization of debt discounts on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt. We expect the results of the second quarter to also reflect $70 million of losses when we complete the repayment of the 2027 and 2031A convertible notes. We estimate $15 million to $20 million for the tax effects netted against these items.","Non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition of between $65 million and $75 million. Also, the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Assuming a $22 share price, this would equate to a reduction in diluted shares of $43 million. Please refer to our convertible debt dilution table, which is included in the earnings call data file posted on our website.","In fiscal Q1, DRAM revenue was up 69% and gross margins were in the low-to-mid 30% range, an improvement of over 7 percentage points from the prior quarter. This was primarily a result of two factors. First, a full quarter of the favorable cost structure of Elpida's operations. Second, opportunistic shifts to a higher mix of wafer sales in both, PC and mobile markets, which generated above average gross margins despite having below average ASPs.","Like-for-like PC DRAM ASPs were up double digits in the quarter. As you know, we participate in Inotera's results with our 35% ownership interest. If you combine our share of Inotera's net income with our reported DRAM gross margins, and add back the inventory step up cost from the Elpida acquisition, DRAM margins would be approximately 7 percentage points higher than reported on a GAAP basis.","I\u2019d also note that the Inotera JV is a highly efficient capital structure, including the margin on the sale of Inotera's products and our share of their equity method earnings over the past two quarters. Inotera is currently generating an annualized ROI close to 130% based on our total cash investment to-date.","As Mark mentioned, Elpida met and generally exceeded the performance estimates we provided in early August. In December, Elpida transitioned to a cost plus model similar to our other fabs across the world. As a result, Elpida is now part of our total DRAM results and will no longer have separate reportable financials.","DRAM guidance for Q2 is as follows. Production bit growth is approximately flat. Quarter-to-date ASP is approximately flat, and cost per bit is down mid-teens. The key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the second quarter are; less impact going forward of selling through stepped up inventory acquired with Elpida, continued transition of the Fab 7 in Singapore to NAND production, and opportunistically shifting to a higher mix of wafer-based sales in both the PC and mobile markets with higher than average margin and below average ASP and cost.","Turning now to NAND. On the Trade NAND side, revenue was up approximately 10% as we benefited from increased NAND volumes from Fab 7 in Singapore. Gross margins were in the low-to-mid 30% range, up slightly quarter-over-quarter. Like-for-like market prices were generally flat to slightly down in the quarter, although initial output from Fab 7 is selling in component form at below average margins.","Trade NAND guidance for Q2 is as follows. Production bit growth of high teens. Quarter to-date ASP down high teens, and cost per bit down mid-teens. The key trends affecting Q2 guidance are; first the continued conversion of Fab 7 to NAND, which achieved wafer output crossover in the first quarter. Also, considered are lower expected ASPs related to seasonal demand and increased production of high density products initially being sold in component form, which typically have a lower average ASP.","Following fiscal Q2, we expect to see an increased mix of embedded systems sales, including SSDs, which should improve our ASP mix.","NOR sales in the first quarter decreased compared to the previous quarter as we continue to see NOR applications primarily in the wireless space convert to NAND. We see this trend continuing through Q2 with NOR revenue in the $100 million to $110 million range. Longer-term we expect to see revenue stability and growth in gross margins with the vast majority of NOR sales in the embedded market and our planned transition to 300 millimeter production for our new applications.","The company generated $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in the first quarter. This operating cash flow includes a deposit from a customer of $250 million associated with a long-term DRAM supply agreement. This supply agreement provides for current market pricing at the time products are sold. Subtracting the $669 million capital spending from the $1.5 billion operating cash flow netted $838 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, as Mark mentioned. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.4 billion, up just over $200 million from our year-end. Also, in the first quarter the first installment payment of $534 million was made under Elpida's reorganization plan. The next payment is due in December of 2014. Capital spending for 2014 fiscal year is still expected to be between $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion.","Earlier in the second quarter, we executed a borrowing guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. That netted approximately $435 million with a cash interest rate of 1.26% and no significant financial covenants. We are continuing our efforts to optimize our capital structure with a focus on dilution management as well as a long-term debt reduction. The convertible note transactions I mentioned earlier were executed in response to the significant increase in our share price over the past six months or so, which has driven additional potential share dilution. The transactions reduced current potential dilution by about 3% to 4%, based on a $22 share price and reduced future potential dilution as well. The net effect of all our debt activities across the quarter was a decrease in debt of $243 million. We will continue to evaluate additional capital transactions in line with our strategic objectives.","Now I will turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.","Mark Adams","Thanks, Ron. As this is our first quarter with the Elpida operations fully integrated into our results, I thought it might be helpful to discuss how we are structured within our manufacturing network before commenting on our Q1 performance and the current state of the memory market.","We have communicated on past calls that over the last 18 months or so through M&A and redefining strategic joint venture partnerships, we have increased our overall capacity by greater than 90%, all of which was existing industry capacity. A key focus for us as part of this growth is to ensure operational efficiency and how we manage that capacity. After the sale of our Italy and Israeli fabs in our fiscal year '13 and with the close of our Elpida acquisition, Micron's volume manufacturing sites are based in three geographic areas, Japan, which is primarily focused on mobile and graphics DRAM, Taiwan, the location of Inotera and Rexchip operations which is focused on computing, server and networking DRAM and Singapore which is our primary location for our high volume, non-volatile technology with NOR and NAND manufactured there. Combined with our high-volume production sites, we are manufacturing some of our specialty embedded products at our Manassas, Virginia facility and leverage our Lehi, Utah plant for our strategic NAND and emerging non-volatile production.","Our customers appreciate the geographic diversity as it creates a natural hedge against production disruption and they also value the flexibility from a product sourcing perspective. On the manufacturing front, our team has done a great job in improving productivity across our network. We saw some noteworthy cycle time reduction at the sites in Q1 that lead to strong bit growth production far exceeding our guidance. As our business increasingly diversifies across a growing number of end-market segments, we continue to serve customers with different requirements. Customers and segments such as automotive, networking, gaming, mobile and storage, all plays different levels of prioritization in areas like assembly, test, supply and quality. This diversification in end market is driving us to think about each of these businesses almost as independent operations.","A good example of this dynamic is how we view our inventory. In our Server business, we have customers who compete for large volume orders and thus rely on Micron's flexibility reacting to the increasingly volatile demand requirements.","In NAND Flash, we serve consumer, automotive, mobile and storage customers, where a growing number of NAND chips are integrated in new packages and full system solutions. Each of these has their own build cycle and inventory requirements. Thus as our business evolves, we may strategically choose to build inventory and\/or adjust our product mix accordingly.","As Mark commented earlier, we were pleased with our Q1 results highlighted by a strong quarter in DRAM. Our DRAM gross margins improved over seven percentage points from Q4. Three of our four BUs consume DRAM capacity to address their customer segments, DSG, WSG and ESG.","DSG, which focuses on computing, networking, server and consumer including graphics, makes up over 60% of our overall DRAM revenue. The combination of Micron's legacy mobile business and the former Elpida's mobile business comprised roughly 30% of our DRAM revenue with ESG contributing the remaining segment serving automotive, industrial, military and medical customers often referred to as a my AIMM.","In my opening comments, I noted where specific products are manufactured in volume. As part of our network design, we are set up to ensure maximum flexibility in our network. For example in DRAM, we continue to evaluate our computing versus mobile demand profile to optimize profitability when possible. Even within this segment, we are managing our inventory direct output to the most profitable opportunity. A good example of this has been our mobile DRAM business.","We have customers requiring known good die mobile DRAM components that are sold in wafer form as Ron noted with the margin profile more attractive compared to fully assembled models, therefore we are shifting some of our DRAM capacity in this direction to capture the incremental margin.","A number of our largest OEM customers communicated shortages in DRAM, and are looking for more supply in our calendar Q1. We continue to see strong demand signals from our computing, mobile, networking and embedded customers and thus expect a healthy DRAM business throughout the remainder of our second quarter.","On the DRAM technology front, we are ramping our world-class 25 nanometer process and we have been pleased with the progress to-date. We will continue to ramp 25 nanometer and will introduce our 20 nanometer technology in the second half of the calendar year. We are also the first supplier to sample low-power DDR4 to our customers and chipset partners. This allows them to debug their next-generation systems and reference platforms with Micron solutions.","Our overall NAND business surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time an 8% quarter-on-quarter increase. Our Trade NAND business achieved revenue growth of roughly 10% quarter-on-quarter with margins up slightly as bit growth was up 17%, driven primarily from our Fab 7 conversion from DRAM to NAND.","As is the case, any time new capacity comes online, we are in the process of qualifying customers on products that use Fab 7 output. We thus saw an unusually high percentage of our output sold in component form versus prior quarters. We anticipate that this dynamic should last three to six more months as we align our Fab 7 output to customer qualification cycles.","During the quarter, SSDs including component sales to strategic SSD customers represented 48% of our Trade NAND revenue with consumer sales coming in at 30%. We shipped our first 20 nanometer enterprise drive, the M500 DC product to a large OEM in Q1. In addition, we are on track for customer qualifications of 20 nanometer client drive at major OEMs and channel customers in fiscal Q2, and have plan to begin production of 60 nanometer client drive in our fiscal third quarter.","Outside of solid state storage, we are seeing increasing NAND penetration in the mobile where when packaged behind an MMC controller, it will offer attractive demand growth. In the embedded business, we are seeing growth for NAND, some of which is the NOR replacement option and some of which comes from the development of what I would refer to as industrial solid state applications such as the automotive.","Revenue in the mobile segment represented 12% of our Trade NAND, while AIM was in aggregate, 10%. On the technology front, we are on track to ramp our 16 nanometer planar NAND this calendar year and we continue to make good progress on 3-D NAND which is on track for production samples in late calendar Q1, early Q2. As we have commented on during prior calls, the NOR business is maturing and we are focused on rightsizing our operations to align with the demand profile. As a result of NOR industry dynamics, we view the NOR operations as a cash flow generation business focused on healthy returns.","To that end, our embedded business is driving the majority of our capacity utilization. The shift to a more embedded mix drove margins up from single digits to about the mid-teens in Q1 despite an ongoing I\/O fab charges associated with the business. We began moving NOR production to our 300 millimeter fab in Virginia which will provide significant cost reductions going forward when coupled with our leading 45 nanometer technology. We are focused on continuing to widening our cost advantage in NOR and growing our share in the embedded segment.","In closing, we feel positive about the results our team achieved in Q1 both in topline revenue growth in operating margins as well as our strong cash flow generation. We continue to make progress on the integration front of the Elpida operations. The industry fundamentals remain solid as we are getting strong demand signals from a majority of our end-segments and industry supply in both DRAM and NAND look in balance. We remain optimistic for a strong Q2 and feel consolidated memory industry will continue to enable favorable market conditions over the long run.","With that, I will turn it back over to Kipp.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks, Mark. Before we take questions from callers, I would like to turn the call back over to Ron for just one quick clarification.","Ron Foster","Thanks, Kipp. I had one correction I want to make sure we got out there before questions and that is in the DRAM Q2 guidance, as you can see from the schedule we filed on the website, our cost per bit is projected in the second quarter to be down high-single digits, DRAM cost per bit.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks, Ron, and happy to follow up on that with any questions as well, but with that we would like to take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speaker phone, please pick up the handset when asking a question so we can hear you clearly.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Glen Yeung from Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir. Mr. Glen Yeung, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","Sorry about that. Can you hear me? My question is on the DRAM business. I am just trying to understand the shift to more wafer-based sales. I assume, one that the more you do obviously is going to have a negative impact on revenues. So if you could just clarify that revenues might be down in the quarter if you move more towards wafer-based sales. Then the ultimate question is, is it accretive to earnings, because as you mentioned gross margins are higher in that business?","Ron Foster","Yes, I mean that's right on. The actual impact on ASPs is not necessarily favorable but overall impact on margin is favorable.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","I am sorry. Just to clarify it, and ultimately you believe it's accretive to earnings, and combination of that will be better earnings?","Ron Foster","That\u2019s primarily, when you think about that, that's the decision on capacity we are trying to make.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","Okay, thanks a lot.","Mark Adams","The key Glen is both the ASP is down and costs are down, and the spread between the two is better than our average, hence a higher gross margin.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","There you go. Okay, thanks. Second question is, your thoughts around the Wuxi fab, not in the sense of asking you when you think it will come up, but whenever it does, do you anticipate having to make any changes in the way you are looking at production, based on the idea that, that eventually comes back into full production?","Mark Adams","We don't see any of that today, Glen. We certainly anticipate that that fab is eventually going to come back into full production. We see it happening maybe in a more measured way than some have prognosticated, but certainly with tight industry inventory today and some of the changes we are already making from DRAM towards NAND, we are not expecting any significant shock to the market or the system.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","Thanks, and last one for me just on CapEx. You are on a run rate now which will put you at the low-end of your annual CapEx guidance. Is it your anticipation that CapEx on a quarterly basis will increase?","Mark Adams","Yes. Our guidance for the year is still intact. As I mentioned, the same range $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion, so there will be quarterly differences.","Mark Durcan","I think there's one clarification on CapEx just in general. As we move into more systems and solutions, some of that CapEx is going to things that don't influence capacity necessarily. Some of it goes into things around packaging technology and assembly technology that's allowing us to build these systems and solution.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering now that Elpida is finally integrated, you could maybe give us a refresher on the amount of DRAM bits allocated to each of the PC, mobile, server, and other specialty areas if you would?","Mark Adams","Yes. We can do that. Would you like it on revenue or bit basis?","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Bits would be great.","Mark Adams","Okay. On a DRAM gigabyte basis - I am just going to pick some of the bigger categories, personal systems Q1 was about 40%, mobile was in the mid-30% range, server was in the mid-teens, and then the rest would be captured in networking and AIMM.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Great. That's very helpful. Then maybe as a follow-up, I believe and I may have not heard this right that you talked about the Singapore fab reaching wafer capacity transition, in the transition from DRAM to NAND. Did I hear that correctly? Then can you talk about when that might be fully transitioned at this point?","Mark Adams","That's right. We were over 50% in the quarter completed and the timing is still potentially variable, but I would look for that to complete out in first half of this calendar year.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Then just last one quickly for me.","Mark Adams","Sorry. Assuming no changes and as you know we have always maintained the flexibility there to make changes depending on market conditions, but as sit today, we anticipate completing that out in an orderly fashion.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Understand. Then last one for me would be, just in terms of the OpEx profile from here. I think you came in maybe a little bit under some of your targets. Can you maybe talk about going forward where there is opportunities either on the SG&A line or the R&D line to bring those down a little bit?","Mark Adams","I think there is some opportunity there over time. It came in a little under primarily, I think, in this current quarter we had some reduced legal expenses that were contributors to that, but on a go forward basis our focus on the R&D line right now is to make sure we make all the investments we need to support the business both from technology transition perspective as well as from a system-level solution enablement perspective, and so we are not looking to drive that down in a big hurry.","On the SG&A front, I will let Ron comment.","Ron Foster","Yes. In terms of overall and as Mark mentioned, we did some timing differences quarter-to-quarter in terms of trends. For example our legal costs vary. If you see our guidance, Q2 is a little bit up from Q1, and also we have wafer qual cost timings that shift around and varied a little bit in Q1, came in lower in Q2 is probably more on a trend line just in terms of the near term views .","In term of forward-looking cost structure, I think if you look at it as a percent of revenue, the way we are currently performing, we\u2019ve talked about OpEx being in a 15% range and I think we can structurally run well below that going forward given current market conditions in SG&A would be commensurately lower as well, so on an absolute dollar standpoint, I wouldn't expect to see significant changes, but I do think as a percent of revenue we can trend in the range we are running now.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two. Starting with NAND, would you be able to elaborate the percentage of the revenue of bits coming from the embedded segment of the market?","Mark Adams","Yes. I can do that for you. In Q1, we don\u2019t -- I am not going to be able to do that for you. Well, we just don't track them quite like that.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Sure. Well, because you said in Q2, you are going to see a mix moving more towards embedded. I am just trying to get a better assessment of how that is going to impact the mix and the margin profile?","Ron Foster","Yes, let me maybe approach it like I did on the DRAM side, I will hit some big buckets for you, and again we don't necessarily include embedded, so that will be embedded applications within some of these different categories, but with that being said, Q1 SSDs would be around 50%. the consumer which includes channel and CPG for us is around 30%, mobile will be in the mid-teens. And then again, networking, storage, and AIM will make up the balance.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Got it. So when I look at your NAND ASP and cost guide, it seems like margins are going to come down. ASP declined more than the cost decline. Is this trend going to reverse into the Q2 because of the mix changing or is that more of the ASP decline going to change? How should we think about the mix versus ASP versus cost into Q2?","Ron Foster","I think in general, we feel that we will improve our mix relative to the market after Q2. We are going, obviously, through a transition. I mentioned in my earlier comments about the output at our Fab 7 trying to align that to customer quality, and it is probably another three to six months dynamic ongoing. The other part that is worthy of note is that there is a natural ASP degradation, you are shifting SSDs to components. It might not be as much of a margin hit as much as ASP going down to the Bill of Materials lower and all that. So you have got the Fab 7 dynamic and just the mix dynamic that contribute to what assumes to be a decline in ASPs.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","If I may just add one more question for the big picture. In the Analyst Day in August, you talked about being more aggressive on acquisition, especially as you focus more on a system level storage. Can you give us an idea or any kind of flavor as where you are and help us understand or elaborate what kind of acquisition targets you are looking at?","Mark Durcan","Well, I think there is, obviously, as we build out our organization, we are doing a lot of that organically. We will continue to look at inorganic opportunities but certainly we are not in a position to go forecasting what, when, where or how any of that might happen?","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Is it more controller, is it more softer or is it more just offered acquiring talents, is what I am asking?","Mark Durcan","Well, we are acquiring talent across the spectrum to support those system level solutions. So you will note, in the last quarter we brought in some more senior leadership in the controller area with Brian Angell. We also brought in Tom Snodgrass in the system level storage solutions area and we will continue to bring in people up and down the organization whether they are software folks, firmware folks or hardware folks to support those efforts.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","When you look at your end markets between PC and smartphones, there is a lot of weakness. It looks like you guys had very good margins and there's good supply displayed. Do you expect to see that operating stability and discipline continue into 2014 even after Wuxi comes on?","Mark Adams","You know, we do. We think that the overall PC market feels like it's stabilizing a bit. At least from our customers' perspectives. The demand is pretty robust, as I mentioned earlier, quarter-to-date and we think that the balancing between that, not just the smartphone segment, we have got pretty good inroads into, what I would say, is the utility smartphone business that our customer breadth there is allowing us to diversify away. So we are not so heavily concentrated in the smartphone segment itself. So we don't necessarily feel that we are overly exposed to that dynamic you are referring to, post Wuxi coming back on. We feel pretty comfortable where we are at on the customer engagement model and what the customers are asking from Micron from a capacity standpoint.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Got it, and then Elpida, can you talk about regarding the cost synergy opportunities, let's say in test and packaging? And I also wanted to get your thoughts on the Yen, how you are looking at that side from there and then hedging there?","Mark Adams","On the packaging side, Elpida certainly has their own approach to packaging. So as we look at Micron going forward, we are drawing up our own strategy in terms of an internal and external approach, a hybrid approach to how we are assuming our product needs. A good way of thinking about this, or rather a simple way of thinking about it is, for some of the higher touch, higher value add products and applications more of that will be done in-house. And as we evaluate future opportunities, some of our more commoditized low-end business PC, mobile application, where they don't require a lot of touch and development will probably use some outside third-party to get that done.","Ron Foster","Vijay, on the yen and hedging question, I also make a couple of comments, see if I hit your point and ask for clarification if you want to go somewhere else with it. We use natural hedges in our Japan and Taiwan largely to protect our balance sheet along with some yen based forward contracts to protect us on our yen and our largest exposure as you probably know relates to a \u00a5140 billion creditor payments scheduled out over the next few years in Japan, so we use those hedging approaches, largely natural hedges, but some forward contracts to cover that.","Another data point I might just mention is on operating cost structure of one yen change in the yen-dollar rate will affect our operating cost quarterly in the neighborhood $5 million to $7 million just as a reference.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Got it. [Good number].","Ron Foster","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman from Bernstein.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good numbers today. My question is really on the NAND DRAM mix. Looking at the gross margins commonly I think both, NAND and DRAM are somewhere in the low-to-mid 30% gross margin, but currently with your ramp that you talked about in Singapore, the conversion of DRAM to NAND, is causing little bit of problem on the ASP side and gross margin for NAND looks like at least what you are saying for the ASP quarter-to-date seems to be down quite a bit.","With that in mind, it looks like the NAND gross margin is going to be quite a bit below DRAM in the coming, quarter fiscal Q2 and perhaps beyond, so in that case I am wondering like how you think about that?","You commented, I think, Mark Durcan, you commented that you may have some flexibility how you look at things and I am wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that considering the fact that the extra production that's coming out of the Singapore fab is causing pricing and margin to come down for your NAND segment and if you would consider to perhaps delay that conversion to ease that situation. Considering that DRAM is doing quite so well these days.","Mark Durcan","Thanks, Mark. It's a good question and one which obviously we think a lot about. I think the key here is we want to be careful we don't optimize a short-term at the expense of a long-term and we will continue to look at what the exact right balance is, but we think in terms of some of our challenges right now relative to NAND as we bring this new capacity online are more short-term oriented relative to enabling the customer socket and getting the product placed in the right place as opposed to a long-term supply\/demand phenomenon.","When we look at the long-term dynamic for NAND, we still think that's going to be pretty robust, so we will obviously keep a close eye on it and we do have flexibility, but as I mentioned earlier, our trajectory today is to continue to move towards closing that out in an orderly fashion over the next year.","Ron Foster","Just to add to that, Mark, as I think you numerically observed, but to be clear the current margins are pretty darn close to the same Q2. We might have a little bit of shift related to mix as Mark Adams commented about etcetera, but that's a short-term phenomenon so there's not a huge difference between the two right now.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Got it, so basically your goal is - would you believe that this mix issue is a short-term issue and you believe that within three to six months as you said you are going to be ought to transition this extra production in Singapore towards more higher margin solution products and therefore the margin should then catch-up back to the kind of more similar to DRAM back to the mid-30s or even higher gross margins, so you think this in other words is more of a short-term issue?","Ron Foster","We do. When you think about coming online with a Fab 7 or anytime you bring on new capacity out of a fab, your customer qualification process is somewhat timely around their only products, so as we go through that our early output tends to go into more commodity homes in the short-term and as Ron just noted, it hasn't dramatically hit our margin in Q1. So we are in the process of qualifying major OEMs on this output and we think the timeframe is roughly three to six months that will get us back to a more stable margin profile that we can drive the right capacity into the right sockets.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","All right. That's very helpful, and I just have one further follow-up. You mentioned 3-D NAND schedule samples in the late Q1 and Q2. Can you clarify, you are talking about 2014?","Mark Adams","That's right. I am sorry about that. Yes, when I made the comment earlier, we are still on track and optimistic that a late Q1, early Q2 for production samples for 2014.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","For 3-D and any more comment on how you think 3-D NAND, how that will shape-out in the future in terms of potential mix or when production may ramp-up? What product categories would be with more higher end enterprise versus lower end lower cost? Any kind of comments you can help us in how to think about that?","Mark Adams","Well I can tell you little bit about how we see it. I think we think from 3-D volume perspective, we think it will be, for us, a broad spectrum of application usage. We are looking to, obviously, enable it in the high end and use it to our advantage to drive enterprise but the way we have architected our products is going to allow us to cover a full breadth. We think volume is probably back half of 2015 for 3-D and thus we think that where we are in our development, we are on track to do that.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","I see. So you have a broad set of segments, not specifically high-end or not specifically low-end? Do you think it will affect --","Mark Adams","Our design allow us to focus on a couple of key markets that we view as kind of high value for the sockets, but are limited into where we can take this over the long-term.","Mark Newman - Bernstein","Great, and thanks very much. Congratulations.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Can you give us some idea what gross margin would have been if the inventory for Elpida had not been written-off in the November quarter?","Kipp Bedard","Yes, there was a reconciliation page and basically the stepped up inventory was $111 million.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up question on the 3-D NAND. Could you maybe talk about when you target 3-D NAND, will you look at the cost structure? Is it below your planar NAND cost structure at that time? Or depending upon the applications maybe some applications need high end (inaudible), so you may ramp 3-D NAND just for that applications to begin with? Maybe just if could you talk about what is your strategy on the 3-D NAND side?","Mark Durcan","So let me try and characterize. Obviously, early on, as with any new technology, we are going to pick a couple of applications first, as Mark Adams mentioned a moment ago. Our technology, I think, as you look at different suppliers in the marketplace, different suppliers are taking different approaches to 3-D NAND technology. Some of them, as I think you are implying Monika, have limited performance on certain planes or parameters. Micron's technology, we believe, is more generally applicable to the full swap of applications currently being serviced by planar NAND. So we expect over time we will roll our 3-D NAND across the spectrum. And yes, of course, we believe, over time it will be significantly more cost effective than planar NAND given the scale that goes on with 3-D NAND.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","And then, if I heard it correctly, you said that volume ramp is in latter half of 2015.","Mark Durcan","Well, it's tough to pin that because we have to say what we mean by volume and all the details associated with that but yes, we believe it's a 2015 phenomenon for production ramp on 3-D NAND and significant in the marketplace, probably more or so in the second half than the first half.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Okay, just a last question on the current pricing trends in the NAND market. At least what we see on the channel is slightly weak. Maybe could you talk about pricing trends in different segments in the NAND market?","Mark Adams","The way you have asked the question, the way we look at it, there are some parts of the NAND that have remained very strong and robust and there are some that have shown some of the weakness you are talking about. Some of that by the way is pretty natural out of the holidays, but it's not as severe as prior years necessarily.","We also see some people who are exposed in the NAND business in the mobile market getting a little more aggressive with that capacity and the low-end client business, quite frankly, we are not going to play that game. In addition to moving the components to other application segments, we don't necessarily want to sell our business just to compete the market share perspective, where other people are trying to grab share on pricing, so independent of the Fab 7 dynamic I mentioned earlier, overall it's not bad NAND business, it's just there is pockets of weakness coming out of the holiday and with some softness where people are exposed.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Thank you so much. That's all for me.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the good results. Guys, just relative to the November quarter, I think you said there was $250 million benefit or prepay of DRAM from a customer, I am kind of curious one did that product ship? I guess given that we are all worried about Wuxi coming back online and DRAM pricing going lower, what's the motivation behind the customer actually coming into a contract at today's pricing?","Mark Adams","Well, as we commented on earlier, the way we plan our business is basically with a full Wuxi fab capacity in the market. As Mark Durcan commented on earlier, we have got kind of bit of a shift in dynamic with certainly Wuxi coming on at some point. We don't know when that is, but some point in the future but offset partially by our continued Fab 7 conversion.","If you put that altogether and balance with industry up at about mid-20% range of DRAM bit growth of the year, we think that's in line. We don't think that's going to drive a significant oversupply in the market and we think the customer see that too, so as customers look for 2014 sourcing, as they think about kind of when Wuxi may or may not come online, they are trying to lock up capacity and commitment and are going to make it through as - future calendar 2014.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Mark, that's helpful. When does the product ship?","Mark Adams","We don't want to get into detail, but it's kind of over a longer period. The intent was to secure output over a long cycle, not in a specific quarter for example.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Great. That's helpful then guys in the prepared comments I think you mentioned that you shifted SSD enterprise drive this November quarter. Was that sample or was that actually true shipment of revenue? I am just kind of curious how do we think about the enterprise SSD as a percent of overall SSD mix? Any targets you can share with us for this fiscal year and how should we think about the gross margin differential between enterprise SSD and consumer SSD? Thank you.","Mark Adams","Well, let me answer your first question. It was a sample on the M500 DC product. It was based on our 20 nanometer technology. As we look at it, as I mentioned in terms of the NAND behavior in terms of ASPs and market, on the higher density in the enterprise market obviously we would like to drive as much of our capacity to that segment.","Where customers who have got exposure into the high end smartphone business have capacity, what we are seeing is some aggressive pricing in the client business and we are going to take a look at that versus our retail business which is doing pretty well, and versus our component business and versus other application segments, so we don't necessarily want to go head-to-head and try to compete truly on price in the client business.","If you look at our client business, on its own merit, our average densities in client are much higher than the market and because we are trying to keep that above, what I would say, the trading client business, which again you have got a lot of capacity in the high end smartphone business that's exposed, you might be bit more aggressive in the [business].","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Thanks. Again, congratulations again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick clarifications from me, on the yen part for the current quarter, can you just give us a sense of what you are assuming and how much of a benefit it is quarter-over-quarter to expenses?","Secondly, in terms of just looking at the Elpida cash margins, I don't know, maybe I missed it, but are you being specific about where they exactly were in the quarter?","And then lastly, can you just talk about, I think, you said it is still early on in getting Elpida integration integrated fully. Can you talk about what else is coming, maybe between now and the end of the calendar year?","Ron Foster","Sure, Steven. With regard to the Yen, if you are talking about our forward view, Q1 to Q2, we don't typically assume any exchange rate changes in our outlooks as we give guidance going forward, if that's what you were looking for.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Yes, so it's a benefit, quarter-over-quarter. Is that correct? Like versus what you just reported?","Ron Foster","Yes.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Okay.","Ron Foster","In terms of your question on Elpida cash margins, we are not going to give any more detail on Elpida specifically other than as we mentioned we met or in general, exceeded our projections we gave in August and that was a pretty good outcome in terms of flowing that through our business and getting it combined with overall Micron.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Great, and then just on the roadmap for Elpida integration, please?","Mark Adams","Sure. I don't think there is anything alarming to the process. I think what the comments on integration are that the teams is coming together, they are working pretty well. Of course, we have got the 25-nanometer ramp ongoing as well, as I talked about, second half of the year 20-nanometer product in the market. So as it relates to the focus of the team and just the timeliness of the integration efforts with engineering teams coming together, the marketing organizations coming together, looking at market segment optimization with that team as part of Micron has actually been very helpful for us because of the dynamic between the mobile and computing bit optimization we talked about from an ASP and wafer, our perspective. So a lot of normal stuff in integration that we feel pretty positive about and I think the customers see the breadth and the opportunity for flexibility in our portfolio whether it would be in the mobile portfolio or the pure computing portfolio.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks, Mark. And I think we have time for one more caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel Nicolaus","This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. My question is, can you provide a little extra color on the relative performance and demand in the server segment. I think we often talk about PC and mobile, but how strong is that segment in terms of demand perspective and what do you see going forward?","Mark Adams","Yes. I am sorry. This is Mark Adams. We continue to be very bullish on the server market, really primarily for two reasons. One, which is the applications driving at the data center, cloud computing dynamic, coupled with as much DRAM as they can put in the servers they are putting into the bit growth in servers last year continues to play into this year's numbers and we are seeing significant bit growth in the 50% to 60% range in the server market. So we feel pretty good about that business and it has been very stable and we have been capturing more share quarter-over-quarter for five to six quarters and starting to get in the and setting server market records.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, and as a quick follow-up on the Inotera cost structure arrangement. Does it matter at all which segment the device is for or what else can you provide as insight to how that works?","Ron Foster","So Dean, this is Ron. In terms of the Inotera structure, we don't get into a lot of details on it, but as I think we have commented, it's an averaging pricing mechanism looking at past three months on a moving average basis. So there is a lag defect as that flows through and then in general, we neutralize differences in mix so that we have the complete flexibility to move whatever products where we want in our system. So it doesn't have an difference fundamentally in our pricing or transfer pricing as a result of mix.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks, Dean. With that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

Good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter results accentuate an unprecedented year for the company. I thank the Micron global team for maintaining intense focus on our key priorities and delivering outstanding results. Our fourth quarter revenue was $6.14 billion with record gross margin, operating income and free cash flow. Full year revenue, profitability and free cash flow also set company records. Our results were driven by favorable industry fundamentals and solid execution in deploying our next-generation, lower cost technologies and diversifying our product portfolio toward a richer mix of differentiated, high-value solutions. We are excited about future opportunities as customers increasingly recognize the strategic value of our memory and storage solutions across a range of high growth markets.","Now, I will share details from each of our business units, followed by our perspectives on industry dynamics and an outline of our corporate strategy. In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we saw robust growth in Q4 revenue and profitability compared with the prior year. Our results were driven by strong demand in Cloud and Graphics, complemented by a healthy pricing environment. Revenue growth from these two segments significantly exceeded overall CNBU growth, which more than doubled compared with the year ago quarter. Cloud sales are supported by increasing DRAM content per server, which is up nearly 50% versus a year ago.","In Graphics, we continue to leverage our industry leading GDDR5 and GDDR5X performance to address strong demand, primarily from gaming. The business unit is also benefiting from the initial ramp of our first-generation 1X 8-gigabit DDR4 product, which was sold primarily into the client and cloud segments. In fiscal Q1, we anticipate continued growth of our 1X portfolio, coincident with the ramp of our second-generation 1X 8-gigabit DDR4 and GDDR5 products, both of which have already been validated at certain partners and customers. We also received initial customer qualifications on our TSV-stacked DDR4 products, enabling modules with up to 128 gigabyte and the highest speeds supported on industry standard server platforms. These products address the growing demand for analytics and in-memory databases in both the enterprise and cloud segments.","Fourth quarter revenues in our Mobile Business Unit, were driven by a favorable pricing environment and significant growth in our eMCP business. Due to strong execution, sales from our mobile NAND and eMCP solutions nearly doubled year-over-year. We believe that increased DRAM and Flash capacities in flagship smartphones will continue due in part to new applications such as augmented reality in mobile devices. Our roadmap of new LPDRAM, discrete managed NAND and eMCP offerings position us well to address these market requirements.","In fiscal Q4, we achieved our first 1X LPDRAM qualification at a major Mobile OEM and have several others underway. Also, our technology capabilities in 1X LPDRAM Package-on-Package products allow us to offer cost effective, high capacity mobile solutions ranging from 3 gigabyte to 8 gigabyte. We expect volume shipments of these new products in fiscal 2018 following successful customer qualifications. During the fourth quarter, we also qualified our first 3D TLC eMCP and eMMC solutions at a major chipset vendor and now have dozens of high-density products in qualification with several OEMs. We expect production shipments to start later in 2017. Our 64-layer 3D TLC UFS products will also start OEM qualifications later in 2017, enabling us to participate in the mobile market\u2019s highest density designs.","The Storage Business Unit recorded a revenue increase of 71% in Q4 compared with the prior year quarter, supported by strong demand for our SSD product portfolio. Late in the fourth quarter, we identified and corrected a flash component issue on select TLC 3D NAND products. We paused shipments of affected products as we worked to implement a solution to the issue, which appeared only under a narrow set of performance conditions. As a result, our SSD revenue declined sequentially during the quarter. Shipments have now restarted and we expect to resume solid sequential SSD revenue growth in Q1.","We continued to garner positive momentum with our SSD products across a broad range of customers. Our flagship SATA 5100 SSD has been qualified at enterprise server OEMs, cloud service providers and Fortune 500 companies. Demand for our client SSDs is also strong, with Micron shipping solutions to most leading PC OEMs. We see healthy demand trends for SSDs moving forward. Client SSD attach rates continue to increase. And although storage density growth has slowed temporarily due to a tight pricing environment, we foresee longer term demand for higher density SSDs. We made substantial progress in growing our relationships and our business with cloud and hyperscale customers in fiscal 2017. Cloud data center customers are seeking innovative memory and storage solutions tailored to their workloads. Micron\u2019s unique capabilities and expertise in DRAM, 3D NAND and emerging memory technologies make us a compelling partner for these customers.","Our Embedded Business Unit delivered strong performance, growing revenue 39% for the full year. We strengthened our leadership position in automotive in fiscal 2017, with growth driven by increasing connectivity and electronics content in vehicles. Automotive applications continue to require leading edge performance. As a result, we have seen significant ramp of our 20-nanometer DDR and LPDDR technologies this quarter and began sampling automotive-grade 1X DRAM to meet these needs. The growth in edge analytics in both industrial and consumer connected home applications led to record quarterly revenues in both segments. We saw strong growth through the year of our NAND and LPDDR MCP products, driven by form factor and performance needs in applications like machine-to-machine communications, surveillance, drones and home automation.","Turning to Micron\u2019s technology progress, our 1X DRAM and our 64-layer NAND production rollout is proceeding on plan and we expect to achieve mature yields in both technologies before the end of calendar 2017. We are pleased with our 1Y DRAM technology progress and are focused on the late stages of technology and product development. Our third-generation 3D NAND development is also proceeding well, with production expected to commence later in 2018. This latest generation technology continues to utilize Micron\u2019s industry leading CMOS under the array architecture, which yields smaller die sizes. We have made significant progress in our technology development and volume ramp execution. We see meaningful opportunities to further shorten the cadence of new technology node introductions, accelerate new technologies into volume production, upgrade our fab infrastructure and expand our captive assembly operations. Through successful execution, we expect to narrow our technology cost gap and optimize bit output growth in both DRAM and NAND, with a disciplined focus on profitable growth.","Our fiscal year 2018 CapEx plan targets achieving these objectives through technology migrations, with no new wafer capacity. Ernie will discuss our CapEx plans in further detail later in the call. Our ability to successfully execute our technology transition plans will be a key enabler of our cost reduction and supply bit growth capability in the foreseeable future.","Moving on to the demand and supply fundamentals, we expect the industry to remain moderately undersupplied for the rest of 2017 for both DRAM and NAND. We see DRAM industry supply bit growth of about 20% in calendar 2017 and expect it to grow at relatively similar levels in calendar 2018. The DRAM industry supply demand balance is expected to stay healthy throughout calendar 2018, driven in part by ongoing strength in data center and cloud computing trends. We expect Micron\u2019s fiscal 2018 DRAM bit output growth to be slightly below the industry growth rate. Our bit growth is supported by our 1X DRAM ramp, which represented mid-teens percent of our DRAM bit output in Q4 and will grow throughout the next several quarters to achieve bit output crossover as we exit calendar year 2018. We expect industry NAND bit supply growth to finish calendar 2017 in the high 30% range. At these levels, supply remains below demand, which has created a constrained environment. As the industry continues to transition to 64-layer 3D NAND, we estimate industry bit supply growth in calendar 2018 will approach the 50% range, which should better satisfy the current unfulfilled demand. We expect that Micron\u2019s ongoing transition to 64-layer 3D NAND in fiscal 2018 will result in bit output growth that is somewhat higher than the industry range.","In fiscal Q4, 64-layer NAND represented mid-teens percent of our trade NAND bit output and we expect to achieve bit output crossover during the second half of our fiscal 2018. The dynamic industry transition to 3D NAND is taking place in the context of a NAND market that has consistently exhibited demand elasticity. We expect this behavior to continue for the foreseeable future as higher-density SSD solutions increasingly displace HDDs in client computing, cloud data centers and enterprise environments and as average capacities continue to grow with more performance-sensitive, storage-hungry devices and applications in mobile and other end markets. These trends support our view that NAND demand drivers will remain healthy into 2018.","As I begin my first new fiscal year as CEO, I would like to outline our strategic priorities. First, we are focused on driving our cost competitiveness to best-in-class levels, primarily by accelerating the percentage of our output on leading edge technology, in both DRAM and NAND. Second, we will drive execution excellence, delivering solutions to customers quickly, predictably and in line with their product launch windows. Third, we will accelerate our transition to high value solutions. We intend to lead the industry in deploying disruptive memory and storage solutions. Fourth, we will leverage the full breadth of our capabilities to develop deeper collaboration and partnerships with marquee customers, maximizing our value in the market. And finally, we are strengthening our focus on our teams, investing in the best talent and driving a winning culture. We believe our diligent emphasis on the speed and urgency with which we execute these strategic priorities will have a transformative effect on our market competitiveness and financial performance. I look forward to sharing the results of our progress with you in the year ahead.","I will now turn it over to Ernie, who will walk through the specifics of our financial performance this quarter.","Ernie Maddock","Thank you, Sanjay and thanks for joining the call today. Our solid operational execution and favorable market dynamics resulted in excellent financial performance in our fourth fiscal quarter and the full year. For the full fiscal year, we achieved record revenue of $20.3 billion, up 64% from the prior year. We narrowed the technology cost gap with our competitors by successfully executing our technology migration plans. Our efforts resulted in strong levels of DRAM and NAND bit output growth for fiscal year 2017 enhancing our competitiveness while maintaining our wafer output.","I will now provide some further details on Q4 results, starting with a breakdown by technology and business unit. DRAM represented 66% of our Q4 revenue with the following segmentation: server held steady at approximately 30%; mobile was 20%; specialty DRAM, which includes Networking, Graphics, Automotive and other embedded technologies, remained in the mid-20% range, and; PC was also in the mid-20% range. Our trade NAND revenue represented 30% of total revenue. The three segments comprised of SSDs; mobile, which includes managed NAND and discrete solutions and MCPs, and; automotive, industrial, and other embedded applications, each represented approximately 20% of our quarterly trade NAND revenue. The remaining 40% of our trade NAND was made up primarily of component sales to partners and customers.","Turning to performance by business unit, the Compute and Networking Business Unit reported record FQ4 revenue of $2.8 billion, more than doubling on a year-over-year basis. The growth was supported by strong demand from cloud customers, who are architecting data centers and computing capabilities that enable them to execute their specific strategies. Our successful conversion to 20-nanometer DRAM production and the initial ramp of 1X DRAM output boosted Q4 CNBU operating income to $1.6 billion or 56% of revenue, up 31% compared with Q3.","The Mobile Business Unit delivered its highest ever revenue quarter at $1.2 billion, up 76% from the year ago quarter. Mobile operating income also set a record at $364 million, or 31% of revenue. Our results are due in part to the positive progress we have made in qualifying our mobile NAND solutions and we expect this momentum to continue in fiscal \u201818.","The Storage Business Unit reported fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.3 billion, up 71% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue and operating income were slightly lower quarter-over-quarter, due to the NAND component issue that Sanjay discussed earlier. With this issue behind us, we are focused on leveraging the progress we have made in penetrating the SSD markets over the past year. We estimate that our global SSD market share nearly doubled in fiscal 2017, enabling record fiscal year revenue for the Storage Business Unit. Our operating income for the fourth quarter was $250 million or 19% of revenue compared with a loss of $57 million in the same period last year.","The Embedded Business Unit also achieved record performance in fiscal Q4, with revenue of $827 million, up 18% sequentially and 61% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by solid sales for consumer applications, which include home automation. Automotive also remains a key revenue driver for this business, as the shift toward smarter and connected cars is driving increased memory content. These trends bode well for Micron as we continue to capture new design wins and strengthen our leadership position. Operating income for EBU was $348 million in Q4 or 42% of revenue more than doubling year-over-year.","Moving on to overall company results, revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $6.1 billion, up 10% from last quarter and 91% on a year-over-year basis. Sales of server and SSD solutions each were more than 3x higher than year ago levels, reflecting our focus toward a higher value-add to revenue mix. Non-GAAP gross margin was 51%, up 3 percentage points from Q3 and 33 points from the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201816. The improvement reflects the successful adoption of products based on our advanced technologies, combined with a healthy industry pricing environment. Non-GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, or $2.02 per share. For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP net income of $5.6 billion or $4.96 per share compared with $273 million or $0.26 per share for fiscal 2016.","Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and increased 13% sequentially. The sequential results reflect a 5% increase in bit shipments. DRAM non-GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter was 59%, up 39 percentage points from year ago levels and up 5 points sequentially benefiting from an 8% increase in ASPs. We are seeing the benefits of execution on our technology migration plans and the continued strong market environment.","Trade NAND revenue increased 81% on a year-over-year basis. Sales were 8% higher quarter-over-quarter, supported by demand from mobile and embedded segments and a 5% increase in ASPs. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 40%, up 24 percentage points from a year ago and down 1 percentage point sequentially as a result of the NAND-related issues mentioned earlier. NAND bit shipments increased sequentially by 3% during the quarter. Our fiscal year results reflect strong adoption of our 3D TLC NAND products and a strong market environment. As we consider the ongoing progress of the business, as well as the competitive environment, we plan on make a few changes to our disclosures, beginning with FQ1 2018. Specifically, we will be eliminating the presentation of changes in cost per bit and market segmentation detail for each technology. The evolution of our business to higher value-add solutions, which often have higher BOM costs and higher margin opportunities makes cost per bit comparison a less reliable indicator of our progress.","Relative to the market segmentation by technology, we will continue to provide qualitative color through our business unit reporting. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $601 million, essentially flat from the prior quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion in fiscal Q4 compared to $896 million in the year ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.5 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions and $5.1 billion for the full fiscal year. DRAM investments were between 40% and 45% of the full year spend and non-volatile memory was around 30%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion and for the full year it was $3.3 billion compared to negative $2.7 billion in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we deployed $1.6 billion or approximately 50% of our free cash flow for de-levering activities. The result of these activities represents approximately $0.07 of annualized EPS accretion. We ended the fourth quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $6.2 billion.","Turning to more near-term matters, as we have been discussing for some time, our two key priorities for cash flow are accelerating the company\u2019s cost competitiveness and improving our financial foundation through reducing leverage. Our fiscal 2018 plan enables both priorities. We currently expect our fiscal 2018 CapEx, net of partner contributions, to be in the range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. Our investments will be focused on technology transition and product enablement. Generally, we expect that between 35% and 45% of CapEx will be deployed for DRAM, 35% to 45% for non-volatile memory and the remainder for technology and product enablement. There are no wafer capacity additions planned for fiscal 2018.","We will continue to target our free cash flow generation for the opportunistic retirement of debt. We see the opportunity to reach our interim target of $8 billion to $9 billion of gross debt during fiscal 2018. These actions, together with the progress that we have made in fiscal 2017, would drive annualized EPS improvement of between $0.18 and $0.23. We also see the potential to be net cash positive as we exit fiscal 2018.","Moving on to guidance for fiscal Q1 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: revenue in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion; gross margin in the range of 50% to 54%; operating expenses between $575 and $625 million; operating income ranging between $2.65 billion and $2.85 billion; and EPS ranging between $2.09 and $2.23 per share based on 1.191 billion diluted shares.","With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Ernie. As part of our strategic planning process, Micron developed a new vision statement that embodies how we see the opportunities in front of us. As we close out 1 year and look to the next, I would like to now share it with you. Our vision, transforming how the world uses information to enrich life, captures the tremendous potential Micron possesses. New technologies like artificial intelligence will change the world in ways we can barely imagine today. Fast data access and high-performance data analytics will be at the heart of those transformations, making memory and storage core to the data-centric world that is taking shape in front of our eyes. I believe our strategy to tighten our focus, accelerate our technology and product development and strengthen our presence in critical markets will make Micron an increasingly prominent player in the industry as these revolutionary new technologies take shape. Fiscal 2017 was a record year for us, but I am confident that the best is yet to come for Micron. We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Can you hear me?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes.","John Pitzer","Yes, Ernie, Sanjay, congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Ernie, my first question just around your CapEx number, $7.5 billion, that doesn\u2019t surprise me as much as your sort of guidance around bit growth for DRAM and NAND for the fiscal year just given the significant jump in CapEx. I am wondering if you can just help me understand to what extent is this being driven by a back-end loaded expectation around CapEx and how do we think about kind of the bit growth exiting next fiscal year? And I guess at what point, do you think you begin to start to outgrow bits relative to the industry for both DRAM and NAND?","Ernie Maddock","Yes. So, multipart question let me try and break it down in easily understandable way. First, as you pointed out, there is a time lag between the time CapEx is invested and the time that the bit growth is realized. And certainly, if you look at what we did in 2017 that was actually a function of the investments that we made in 2016 and it\u2019s also important to remember that the bit growth that we were able to realize from the Inotera investments were not part of my current CapEx plan. And so if you add Micron\u2019s spend and Inotera\u2019s spend, you are probably in the upper $6 billion range and so that\u2019s a good point of comparison as we now look at 2018. So in 2018, we would expect the majority of the bits that or the results of the CapEx to come on towards the latter part of the fiscal year. And you heard Sanjay in his prepared remarks say that we would be at bit crossover on an output basis for our 64-layer NAND around the second or third fiscal quarter of the year, but it was going to be the exit part of the calendar year for DRAM before we hit bit output crossover on 1x. So, that gives you some sense of the timing and the impact of timing on those investments. I would also tell you that our objective over a multiyear period is to grow at about industry levels. And certainly, we think this investment plan over the course of a multiyear horizon will allow us to do that, obviously, being above in 2017 fiscal as we have just reported DRAM at the low-end, little above on NAND. So I think looking at snapshot comparisons across our fiscal year is interesting, but really important is the segment that we intend to grow aligned with industry over the course of these multiyear periods. And I think that\u2019s probably the best broad perspective I can provide, happy to address any specific question.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And of course, our focus also could be on high-value solutions, so that our revenue share outperforms our bit share.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, guys. And then Sanjay just as my follow-on question, I think clearly, the most significant concern in the investment community is the sustainability of the current environment. So, I would love to kind of get your thoughts on sustainability. And I guess specifically to what extent in an environment like this, can you move the business from more sort of a transactional hand-to-mouth business to something that might have more backlog and visibility with your customers, especially as you try to move the mix towards more higher value end solutions?","Sanjay Mehrotra","In terms of the market environment, we are certainly excited about the demand requirements for DRAM as well as for NAND. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, bit growth driver for DRAM certainly that\u2019s outpacing the average growth of the industry is in the area of server and cloud. And here we are making great penetration with the hyperscale customers in terms of driving the growth of the DRAM business. So, we remain very bullish about the DRAM market environment through the 2017. We think it will be undersupplied. And given the demand trends, we think we will have healthy demand supply balance in DRAM throughout 2018 timeframe as well. And in terms of NAND as it\u2019s well-known that average capacities are increasing certainly in mobile devices, but even more importantly, SSDs are displacing HDDs at the rapid pace with the attach rates continuing to be projected to be going up over the course of next several quarters. And of course, there is a strong value proposition for SSDs in the cloud and hyperscale data center environment as well given all the trends of artificial intelligence, machine learning, all of this is driving big data analytics. So, all these trends are related to artificial intelligence, bit growth in data customers wanting to offer differentiated value to their end customers, all of this is driving need for memory and storage solution and overall, we remain pretty bullish about the demand trends. I mean, if they look at DRAM as well as NAND even in autonomous vehicle, the demand requirements for flash, I mean data is being generated. So much data is being generated by autonomous vehicles that it requires fast processing both within the vehicle as well as on the cloud. So, I think demand trends for the foreseeable future continued to be strong and that bodes well for our industry.","In terms of your question regarding customers and some of the customers wanting to engage in longer term requirements, yes, that is absolutely happening and we do consider that based on various customers. I mean, it depends on the nature of the customer\u2019s requirements, really cannot get into the details of that here in this call, but certainly, our business includes customers that are more transactional in nature that have business more on a monthly transaction basis, some that are more on a quarterly basis and certainly certain customers that are also involved in longer term trends. I think customers are just seeing increasing value of memory and storage. I mean, this DRAM and flash is becoming strategic to our customers and our customers are seeing Micron as being uniquely positioned with having a strong portfolio of DRAM as well as flash and being the only company in the Western Hemisphere with those capabilities and that is definitely making us an attractive and valued partner to our customers.","John Pitzer","Thank you, guys. Congratulations again.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra Gill","Yes, thank you. I echo the congratulations. Question on the NAND bit growth, so the bit growth is increasing to 50% from kind of the high 30s this year, a lot of this obviously being driven by 3D NAND. Wanted to talk about in terms of how you are seeing the supply demand balance going into next year in the NAND environment and kind of your thoughts around pricing as we start to have more supply and the impact also to cost per bit?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, in terms of going in to 2018, we see healthy industry demand and supply balance for NAND. And you are right to note that the bit growth is going up because of the technology transition in the industry to the 64-layer technology. And when we look at the demand trends, those demand tends continue to be strong as I just pointed out related to SSDs as well as increasing average capacities of flash in mobile devices and all kinds of other devices. So, demand continues to be strong. We see healthy trends in that regard in 2018 timeframe. Regarding pricing, we don\u2019t specifically for competitive reasons provide comments on pricing on the call, but we just like to point out that we believe that the healthy industry environment as one where price decline is less than or equal to cost declines and we are certainly focused on aggressively reducing our product cost with realizing successfully our technology production ramp of 64-layer.","Rajvindra Gill","Thanks. And just my follow-up, Sanjay, one of the positive trends that has been happening at Micron is the diversification of the end markets for DRAM and you could just compare this cycle say to previous cycles, maybe not just too long ago, but only about 3 years ago, where PCs were a higher percentage of DRAM and now they are mid-20% range today. So, can you talk about that phenomenon and you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but the diversification of the end markets in DRAM specialty, particularly in graphics and automotive and server? How that is affecting the business model? How that is affecting the customer relationships and engagements going forward? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Certainly, the diversification of the end markets for DRAM absolutely bodes well for the future health of our business. We have enjoyed the benefits of that. Calendar year 2017 as you noted is a great example. And you just pointed out the mix of our DRAM business between PC what used to be just about PC and mobile is now very much about PC mobile, server, automotive and multitude of markets and Micron has really great presence, where variety of I mean whole slew of customers and channels. So, this really bodes well, plays very well to the strength of Micron. It has really for long time enjoyed diversified set of global customers and great presence in channels and that is coming into full play as the demand requirements for DRAM continue to grow nicely and into multiple mega-markets.","Rajvindra Gill","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein.","Mark Newman","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats again on the great results. My question is about the technology migration you talked about 64-year second crossover I believe second half FY \u201818. Can you talk about what\u2019s next on NAND Flash 96-year or whatever it is and what the timing is? And will Micron look at transitioning to a charged flat flash alternative at 96-layer or perhaps one after that? And then similarly, for DRAM, what is the plan for 1Y and timing for EUV?","Sanjay Mehrotra","With respect to NAND in terms of our third-generation 3D NAND, we are not yet disclosing the number of layers in that technology. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are continuing to make good progress with that and we plan to be introducing that technology in the 2018 \u2013 calendar 2018 timeframe and continuing to deploy CMOS under the array technology that continues to provide Micron a die-sized leadership position, which is usually attractive to us [indiscernible] point of view. And with respect to DRAM in terms of 1Y node, we will be introducing that node also in calendar 2018 timeframe. And beyond that, we are not providing any specific details for our technology related to competitive basis. And your question regarding floating gate, we have a strong roadmap of future technologies related to floating gate.","Mark Newman","And then just a quick follow-up if I may, when do you think you will narrow the gap or catch up potentially with Samsung in both the NAND, 3D NAND and DRAM, I mean, I think that you have alluded before to closing the gap and narrowing the gap to zero hopefully eventually, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happened yet. Is there an update on your thinking of when that could be?","Sanjay Mehrotra","As we have indicated before that in terms of technology cost position as well as the technology node readiness, in recent times over the course of last couple of years, Micron has lagged the competitor in terms of getting advanced technology ready at par with them and deploying those technologies into volume production. However, in recent times, Micron has made very good progress in this area and we are getting the benefit of that as we are ramping those technologies into production. I have said before that these kind of undertakings, driving, accelerated deployment of new technology nodes into volume production and continuing to narrow the gap on the cost front is a multiyear phenomena and we have made very good progress in this regard. I fully expect us to make \u2013 continue to make good progress in fiscal year 2018 as well. And we are of course very much focused on continuing to accelerate the timeline of our future technologies into production and then well positioned to ramp those technologies into volume production as well. And along with this of course remain very much focused on driving a greater mix of high-value solutions both in DRAM and NAND as well. So, these are really two very important pillars of our strategy driving cost competitiveness and driving greater mix of high value solutions and these things don\u2019t happen overnight. They will continue to be strong growth opportunities for us going forward over the course of next few years.","Mark Newman","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Two quick questions for me. First of all, you mentioned that as demand \u2013 your bit growth accelerates for NAND next year that you expect to capture some of the pent-up demand that the NAND market has seen. I guess, I was curious if you could talk about what gives you confidence that pent-up demand has naturally turned into demand destruction this year, why it will still be there? And then secondly, if I look at the CapEx breakdown that you provided, it looks like about $1.5 billion or so is dedicated towards product enablement. And I was just curious how that number compares to maybe a year ago and if there is anything you would say is most focused on? Thanks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, I will let Ernie comment on the CapEx, but on the demand side, as I pointed out earlier, I mean it\u2019s not that this demand is perishable, I mean this demand in terms of the trend of SSDs replacing HDDs in client notebook computers where the attach rate continues to increase in 2017 attach rate of SSDs to PCs is around 35%. That attach rate over the course of next few years continues to grow to around 50% in 2018 and by 2020 timeframe expect it to go to around 75%. So, these demand trends are secular in nature. It\u2019s the same thing on the enterprise side, again on the cloud side that the attach rate of SSDs as well as the average capacity requirements on our per-server basis continued to go up as well. So, these are really very solid secular trends here that are long-term in nature and of course the trends of mobile devices adding new rich features such as augmented reality, such as rich displays, all of these are trends that also continue to drive higher average capacities in mobile devices. So, I feel very good about the demand trends on the NAND side.","Steven Fox","Yes. And just to follow-up on the CapEx, if you look year-on-year, we just reported the totality of fiscal \u201817 and you would get a reasonably similar number within the ranges we provided. So there we would expect on a hard dollar basis perhaps $100 million to $200 million more in that enablement and technology piece of the business and that\u2019s predominantly related to the centers of excellence that we have been talking about relative to wanting to consolidate a lot of our back-end operations very close to our front-end operations?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes, some of this product enablement CapEx is related to back-end captive assembly operations, which will help us improve our cost position going forward. And of course also there is CapEx associated with upgrading of the infrastructure that is needed to realize the technology transitions.","Steven Fox","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","Hey, thanks guys. Can you just give us a little color on the, I guess the three market server mobile and PC on tightness, a relative tightness and how it trended during the quarter? And any information either qualitative or quantitative you have on inventory levels out there at the channel or customers just on DRAM?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Sure, Chris. So, I think as has been the case for a few quarters now, there is actually a fair amount of tightness across those three channels that you mentioned. So, it would be hard to distinguish one from the other relative to any nuances there. I don\u2019t think there is an inventory issue certainly, if you actually take a look at inventory levels that are reported, which are typically financial numbers and adjust those for dollar cost of how pricing has changed over the course of the year. You do get a bit of a different perspective on inventory as reported by a variety of customers and channel partners in those areas, but the environment continues to be strong. The supply demand circumstances continue to be fairly tight and we are working very closely with our customers to make sure that we stay in close sync with them as they think about their plans going forward.","Chris Danely","Great, thanks. And for my follow-up question for Sanjay by the way, welcome to the DRAM party. You were not afraid to engage in M&A at your previous job, can you talk about the willingness or appetite for M&A at this point for Micron versus the desires to continue to improve the balance sheet?","Sanjay Mehrotra","We do not rule out M&A in the future. Right now, our focus is on the priorities that I mentioned that include cost competitiveness and strengthening the high-value mix in our revenue. And of course, if and when, we were to engage in M&, our focus would, of course we to try to strengthen our future opportunity and make it an opportunity that\u2019s absolutely provides a strong ROI, beyond that I would not speculate in this matter.","Chris Danely","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company.","Karl Ackerman","Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Ernie and Sanjay, I want to ask more of a strategic question. Two of your competitors in the NAND industry have been at disagreement on the trajectory of their manufacturing partnership. Are you and your existing NAND partner and client to abstain from future partnerships? And I have a follow-up please.","Ernie Maddock","I don\u2019t think the experience that I think you are referring to colors our perspective on partnerships, that all partnerships are very individualized, partner specific set of activities and so certainly while we continue to become informed just as you do. Our color would be very specific to the circumstances at hand vis-\u00e0-vis any potential partnerships or the continuation of any content, any partnerships. And I think do you have a long history of valued partnerships here and annoying how to make the partnerships work well. So I mean partnerships are important.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Absolutely.","Karl Ackerman","Understand. Appreciate the color. I guess my final question, this was somewhat addressed earlier in call, I just want to move back to, just some of the content growth that we\u2019ve have been talking about, but our fieldwork during the quarter indicated that DRAM fulfillment rates at least in the server market improved from last quarter, but they were still well below 100%. Are you seeing more active engagement today with Tier 2 customers for longer term contract agreements that gives you greater confidence in your capacity planning assumptions?","Sanjay Mehrotra","I mean, we are definitely seeing strong demand trends from \u2013 the entire spectrum of our customers a large what you would call Tier 1 or Tier 2 as you termed, although all customers are important to us and we do engage meaningfully with them and we work closely with them to understand their demand requirement and we apply our own judgment to their demand requirements as well in terms of assessing that overall industry demand trends. And based on those demand understanding of our \u2013 on behalf of our customers, we project healthy industry supply environment in DRAM and NAND.","Karl Ackerman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Thanks, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just looking on the DRAM side, you mentioned the crossover of 1X nanometer, when do you expect to see that? And if you can give us some color on what the cost reductions are as you transition the mix to 1X?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Sure. So, we talked about being at bit output crossover for 1X DRAM by before the end of the calendar year of 2018. And then as we have previously shared for the 1X node, we see somewhere roughly 45% increase in bits per wafer versus 20 nanometer and about a 20 \u2013 to slightly more than 20% cost reduction on a cost per bit.","Vijay Rakesh","Great. Got it. And on the NAND side, obviously, pretty nice numbers on the storage business side, up 71%, but could you parse out how much is enterprise mix for you on NAND and obviously you guys are seeing some good traction there, where do you see enterprise mix exiting next year, let\u2019s say? Thanks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So we say that our SSD mix was about 20% of our NAND revenue and that consists of our sales of client, two client customers as well as to the hyperscale of cloud and enterprise customers. And both are roughly about the same in both of those categories. Beyond that, we don\u2019t provide further breakdown.","Vijay Rakesh","Alright, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra","Hi, good afternoon. Looking at your production cost reduction timeline. Is it fair to assume that there is going to be some slowdown as you reach crossover for 64-layer in NAND meaning that after that there could be little bit of a slowdown in terms of your ability to use production costs? And then if you could reiterate the production cost reduction targets for NAND and DRAM for 2018?","Ernie Maddock","Sure. So, I think that in terms of Gen 3 NAND, we will certainly talk more about that as we are able to in terms of what we might expect and whatever is appropriate for that. So, it is true just on a mathematical basis that as you progress up layer count on an absolute basis, there are less incremental bits and there is an association between cost reduction and bit growth opportunity. But in terms of providing specifics, it\u2019s very, very early to share that with you. And if you look at 64-layer versus the first generation, it\u2019s somewhere in the realm as we have talked about before 2x the density in roughly an aggregate of 30% reduction in bit cost.","Sanjay Mehrotra","In general, the technology complexity increases where subsequent technology generations both in DRAM and NAND and also given the increased technology complexity, gigabytes or gigabits that you gain in NAND as well as DRAM on a per wafer basis tends to decline with advanced technology nodes. So, all of those factors play a role in terms of cost reduction capabilities as well going forward.","Tristan Gerra","Okay, great. And then a quick second question, so you talked about the adoption rate trajectory of SSDs in notebooks, could you also give us your expectation both now in say a year or two in terms of the adoption rate for SSDs in data center and traditional enterprise server?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Sure. I can do that. I just want to add a comment to the previous question on cost. My comment was related to cost on a per wafer gigabyte per wafer basis from one technology node to the next. Of course, cost also depends very much on how you deploy those technologies into volume production. And this is one of our focus areas in terms of deploying advanced technologies faster into production. Now, specific to your second question regarding the attach rates in enterprise and server markets, so SSD attach rate is around 50% there in terms of on a SSD per unit basis and opportunity there is greater. Average capacities are definitely moving fairly fast. In fact, enterprise and data center is one of the fastest growth segments for flash in terms of year-over-year bits demand increases that are projected. Average capacities in enterprise and data center for SSDs are over 3 terabyte. That\u2019s average capacity and that trend continues to increase by some projections tripling almost to 9 terabyte by 2020 timeframe. So as I was saying earlier, I mean, these demand trends for increasing attach rate of SSDs in client and data center cloud computing applications as well as the increases in average capacities are secular trends.","Tristan Gerra","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Mike Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mike Delaney","Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. First question to follow-up on CapEx, I was hoping you could clarify the comment about no new wafer capacity additions. I know you said that explicitly for DRAM, but can you clarify if that also applies to NAND flash. And on that topic, if you could help us understand to what extent you may need to invest in new clean room capacity as part of that CapEx guidance obviously even without adding new wafer property that the amount of factory floor space is going up for both 1X nanometer and more so for 3D NAND. I know, the company had some available, but I am just wondering if any of the spending relates to clean room capacity due to the floor space requirements?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes, Mike. So, certainly the statement about no new wafer capacity in fiscal year \u201818 applies equally to both DRAM and NAND. And relative to your second question, there is not anything material relative to the CapEx guide that we shared that relates to construction costs or whatnot. As you pointed out, there is obviously incremental clean room space available or could be available at pretty low cost, but it would not be material in course of the overall guide that we provided.","Mike Delaney","Okay. And if I could sort of follow-up specifically on smartphone demand trends, if you could touch on what the company has seen in terms of end demand for some of the flagship models specifically? But also, if you could talk about some of the Chinese domestic OEMs, just trying to see any pickup in demand trends for memory from those customers?","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think in the flagship models, to answer your specific question, the demand for DRAM as well as for NAND, average capacities continues to go up. And of course, the mix of these high-end smartphones also as a part of the total smartphone market continues to go up. And specifically to DRAM, average capacities of DRAM in high-end smartphones going from somewhere over 3 gigabyte in 2017 projected to go up to over 5 gigabyte closer to 6 gigabyte by 2020 timeframe. And specifically to NAND, average capacities of NAND in high-end smartphones in 2017 is somewhere around 70 gigabyte, let\u2019s say, projected to double \u2013 or more than doubled by 2020 timeframe as well. So, again, the average capacity increased trends in smartphones continues to be solid, not only actually in high-end smartphones, but in value segment of the smartphone market as well.","Mike Delaney","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Micron for any closing comments.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you. That concludes our call today. We really appreciate your support. And as a reminder, we will be posting the prepared remarks from today\u2019s call as well as a webcast replay on our website later this afternoon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Mark?","Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. I\u2019d like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter, followed by a few strategic and industry thoughts and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary. And before turning to Q&A, we\u2019ll close with our prepared remarks with a few comments by Mark Adams covering additional details of our operational performance and market conditions.","We had another outstanding quarter benefiting from a favorable industry structure and market conditions as well as solid operational execution. We achieved record revenue of over $4.1 billion. Our gross margin improved to 34% and our earnings per share improved sequentially on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We had very strong free cash at 85 million based on operating cash flow of 1.39 billion with CapEx of 562 million. The Company\u2019s focus is to drive operational excellence, deliver differentiated and system level products to diverse market segments and manage capital allocation all with a goal of maximizing long-term shareholder returns. Ron and Mark will cover some specifics related to our execution in these areas.","I believe we\u2019re executing well on multiple fronts, but we still have room for improvement in others which we will also discuss.","Our outlook for memory industry conditions remains favorable. We believe the current industry structure is fundamentally changed and we can now manage our business focused on return based capital and supply decisions which was not always possible in the past. In terms of DRAM, it appears that Hynix\u2019s Wuxi fab is back online and it supplies in the market. Low supplier and customer inventory across multiple segments coupled with our reduction in DRAM capacity as we convert Singapore to NAND has led to an overall stable supply situation, and we continue to see favorable market conditions in what is generally a slow seasonal period.","We expect to see DRAM industry wafer production down at mid-single digits in 2014 as a result of DRAM to NAND conversions and the ongoing increase in process complexity as geometry shrinks. We expect total industry bit supply growth in the low to mid 20% range for 2014. This is slightly lower than our prior estimate. Beyond 2014, we expect similar year-over-year industry supply growth in the 20% to 30% range driven by relatively stable wafer output coupled with slowing process technology migrations compared to historical trends.","We continue to forecast five-year DRAM demand CAGR in the mid 20% to 30% range which implies continued favorable market conditions and likely a reduction in volatility compared to historically DRAM trends. For NAND, we\u2019re projecting industry growth in the low 40% range for 2014. This includes an increase in industry wafer production of just over 10% with the remaining supply growth coming from technology. We expect 2015 to be in a similar range, but we could see a reduction in the growth rate beyond 2015 as 3D production becomes more predominant and there is a subsequent reduction in wafer output given the additional cleaning space required for 3D NAND. We are forecasting a five-year NAND demand CAGR in the high 30% to low 40% range.","As you\u2019ve seen recently in NAND additions to industry capacity can cause volatility in the market given the challenge of matching long-term capacity decisions with short-term demand trends. However, we\u2019re very bullish about the future of NAND Flash and we believe that this will be a very healthy market. There are strong demand drivers and elasticity to drive rebalancing. Micron NAND process technology positioning remains strong, during the quarter, we continue to make progress on ramping yields of our 20 nanometer and industry leading 16 nanometer technologies.","The product team has also delivered some exciting new products and innovations to our customers including the market\u2019s best performing PCIe SSD solution. We\u2019re taking steps to better enable our high performance MLC and SLC components in value-added segments and sockets such as enterprise SSD and mobile eMMC in automobile applications and continue to add resources and controller firmware, software and packaging technologies to support this effort.","Relative to Micron Memory Taiwan formally known as Rexchip in Taiwan, and since the end of last quarter, we\u2019ve been engaged in the purchase of residual shares not previously owned by Micron. As a result of these additional purchases, today we have purchased all but about 0.5% of the outstanding shares. Total consideration paid for the incremental 10.6% of the company was approximately US$145 million.","Finally I\u2019d like to update you on the litigation matter related to Inotera. As you may recall, in the fall of 2008, Micron purchased Qimonda shares of Inotera. In January of 2011, the trustee for the Qimonda bankruptcy proceedings filed suit against Micron in Munich seeking among other things to undo the share purchase agreement from that transaction and to get the Inotera shares transferred back to the Qimonda stake.","On March 13th we received the decision from the Court in Germany. On one hand the decision rejects the trustee claim for the alleged value of participating in the Inotera JV. On the other hand, a part of the decision that is intermediate and not yet enforceable would require Micron Semiconductor, BV to retransfer the purchased Inotera shares to the Qimonda stake.","The Court also determined that the patent cross license agreement that was entered into at that time is cancelled. There will be an update to the litigation discussed in our 10-Q but since the material portions of the decision are not currently enforceable, nor in our view probable. There are not any material adjustments to our second quarter earnings. We believe the Court\u2019s findings against us are wrong and will of course appeal.","In conclusion let me confirm, we are very pleased with the results of the quarter and the outlook for Micron and healthy memory industry dynamics. We remain focused on optimizing value for our shareholders and worldwide customers in 2014 and beyond.","I\u2019ll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.","Ron Foster","Thanks Mark. Our second quarter of fiscal 2014 ended on February 27th, as is our practice, we posted to our Web site a file containing the financial information I will cover including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the second quarter, as well as guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2014.","For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, we reported net income of 731 million or $0.61 per diluted share on the second sequential quarter of record net sales of $4.1 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter was $989 million or $0.85 per share, which is $108 million higher than the first quarter. Non-GAAP adjustments netted to $258 million or $0.24 per share.","Key non-GAAP adjustments included the following, $80 million in accounting losses recognized on the convertible note transactions, this includes loses in the second quarter on the conversions that were initiated in the first quarter as well as losses on the conversions that were initiated in the second quarter. I have more on this in a few moments.","$42 million non-cash flow-through of Elpida inventory step-up related to the acquisition. Substantially all of the inventory step-up is flow-through to cost of goods sold and we don\u2019t anticipate non-GAAP adjustments for this in the future. Q2 adjustments also included $44 million in non-cash amortization of debt discounts and other costs. This primarily consists of the imputed interest on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt.","In the second quarter a $33 million adjustment was made to reduce the provisional gain on acquisition of Elpida, as a result of a change in the determined fair value of Elpida\u2019s assets and liabilities. $55 million in non-cash taxes related to the Elpida operations in the quarter, and finally 42 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the second quarter of $23.06.","In the third quarter, we expect the following non-GAAP adjustments. Approximately $40 million amortization of debt discounts on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt. We expect the results of the third quarter to also reflect $8 million of losses as the debt conversions initiated in the second quarter are completed. We estimate a $5 million to $10 million expense for the tax effects netted against these non-GAAP items.","Non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition of between $60 million and $70 million. Also, the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Assuming a $24 share price, this would equate to a reduction in diluted shares of 40 million. Please refer to our convertible debt dilution table, which is included in the earnings call data file posted on our Web site.","Let\u2019s turn now to our results by technology and our guidance.","DRAM; DRAM revenue in the second quarter reflects stable bit sales and stable average selling prices. We experienced favorable overall market conditions and gross margins improved about five percentage points to the high 30% range. Gross margins benefitted from record sales in the service segment and increasing mix of PC and networking sales as well as the shift to lower cost and higher margin wafer sales in the mobile segment.","If our share of Inotera\u2019s income in the second quarter were recorded in our DRAM gross margin, and we add back the higher cost from the inventory step-up from the Elpida acquisition, our reported DRAM margin would be approximately six percentage points higher than reported on a GAAP basis. DRAM gross margins for Q3 using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter indicates approximately flat gross margin compared to Q2 based on bit production down in the low single-digits including the small reduction in wafer production as a result of the earthquake which temporarily disrupted our Hiroshima fab operations.","Quarter-to-date ASP down low single-digits on mixed effects, and cost per bit down low single-digits, the key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the third quarter are; continued favorable market conditions and generally flat like-for-like product ASP trends quarter-to-date. Limited impact going forward of selling through stepped up inventory acquired with Elpida and lower cost of product coming from Inotera as a result of a greater discount percentage as prescribed in the pricing formula.","Turning now to NAND, on the Trade NAND side, sales volume increased primarily as a result of the continued conversion of our same four fab operations to NAND. Trade NAND gross margins in the second quarter were in the high 20% range, down approximately 5 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Selling prices came under pressure during the second quarter partially due to seasonality and partially due to increased sales in the channel for our incremental production. NAND bit cost reductions were achieved through higher sales volumes of advanced technology products and cost efficiencies associated with expanding production in our NAND focused Singapore operations.","Trade gross margins for Q3 using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter indicate down a couple of points compared to Q2 based on bit production is expected to be down high single-digits, quarter-to-date ASP down low single-digits and cost per bit flat. The key trends affecting this guidance are substantially completing the conversion of the Singapore fab to NAND from DRAM as I mentioned. On a like-for-like product basis we expect to see some market price reductions for NAND in the third quarter. We expect a higher mix of Trade NAND sales in the third quarter to be in the form of SSDs, which have higher bit selling prices and higher costs. Notably SSDs also have longer manufacturing cycle times which impacts our Q3 bit production as we ramp to higher volumes.","In NOR as we indicated in our Q2 guidance NOR sales continued their quarterly decrease with a market shift in wireless applications to NAND, Q3 NOR revenue is expected to be in the $100 million to $110 million range. Longer term, we expect to see revenue stability and growth in gross margins with a vast majority of NOR sales in the embedded market now and our planned transition to 300 millimeter production.","Looking to the other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, the Company generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in the second quarter. As a reminder, the Q1 operating cash flow included a deposit from a customer of $250 million associated with a long-term DRAM supply agreement. So, on a normalized basis, we\u2019re seeing continued improvement in operating cash flows. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of just over $5 billion, up about 650 million from the prior quarter. This amount includes just over $2 billion at Elpida and its subsidiaries, which is not available for general purposes across the rest of the Company. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment in the second quarter were 565 million, and we are on-track to be within our guided range for the fiscal year of $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion.","During the year the Company was focused on reducing the potential dilution associated with our convertible notes through a series of financial transactions. As we outlined at our Analyst Day in February, we intend to migrate our debt mix towards more straight debt overtime where the straight debt has investment grade like covenants and competitive rates. In the second quarter as part of our overall capital strategy, the Company completed an inaugural high yield debt offering that satisfied these objectives, raising $600 million of straight debt with net proceeds to be used for the retirement of our 2014 convertible notes.","In the second quarter we called for redemption of the 2014 notes as well. Given the settlement period required for their conversion, all of the remaining 2014 notes will be settled in the third quarter. As a result, our cash and debt balances will be reduced by approximately $700 million in the third quarter from settlement of these notes. Year-to-date, once we settle the remaining 2014 notes in the third quarter, the net financial effects of the debt restructuring transactions, including the issuance of the high yield debt, increases our debt slightly by approximately $40 million, utilizes approximately $1.3 billion of cash and reduces equity by approximately $1.1 billion. Most importantly, we will have reduced the dilution exposure related to our convertible notes by approximately 68 million shares which adds to the 40 million shares of capped call coverage we have in place assuming the $24 stock price.","Now I will turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. Mark?","Mark Adams","Thanks Ron. Overall, we were pleased with the team\u2019s execution in Q2. In a quarter that at times has proven to be a weaker demand period due to seasonality coming out of the holiday season, our DRAM business continued to deliver strong results with stable revenue and strong gross margin expansion. Our DRAM capacity supports customers and our DRAM solutions group, wireless solutions group and embedded solutions group. We had record bit shipments in DRAM specialty markets including server, consumer and graphic segments.","Our server business achieved 68% year-over-year bit growth in the second quarter. Micron continues to provide our key server customers with unique solutions to help differentiate their products. We are working on HMC or hybrid memory computing enablement with key server customers. We also achieved DDR4 validation at key chipset partners and are beginning to ramp to volume production. We continue to see strong growth in the public clouds market, indicating a three year DRAM bit demand CAGR of 76%.","Our networking business continues to be a segment where our capacity yields attractive returns. Our strong position in networking applications is a result of our technology leading solutions and excellent customer relationships. HMC enablement is also ongoing with major networking customers as a path to provide a higher bandwidth performance. DDR4 enablement with our key chipset partners will drive further differentiation for network solutions. Demand drivers such as LTE roll out in China and continued cloud and datacenter growth fosters a healthy demand outlook for the back half of our year.","Our graphics business had a record quarter shipping over 100 million gigabits. We saw major customer qualification of our GDDR5 product and positive yield improvement on our 25 nanometer process. We had an impressive quarter in the digital TV segment highlighted by a major win for our new I\/O products with a key consumer electronics partner. In addition, we saw a better than expected sales at major game console customers. The desktop and notebook segment remained in good balance during our second quarter and pricing was up quarter-over-quarter. As we commented during our last call, we will continue to optimize our computing versus mobile capacity as driven by market dynamics with a goal of generating the best possible return. In Q2 PC DRAM shipment volume was up 11% when compared to Q1. ","This upside was driven by improvement in overall cycle times as well as continued favorable demand and supply balance in the market. From what we can tell, DRAM capacity in the industry has normalized following the recovery of one of our competitor\u2019s fabs in China. Despite this capacity recovery DRAM market conditions remain favorable and inventories in the channel remain relatively tight below normal levels.","On the mobile front our WSG group had an outstanding quarter with operating margins of 20%. Like-for-like mobile DRAM prices were relatively stable quarter-over-quarter but our blended ASP was down primarily due to increased sales of mobile DRAM wafers also referred to as known good die. WSG revenue was down for the quarter as we adjusted our product mix but the business unit was significantly more profitable, inventory of mobile products in the market remains tight and demand signals from our customers are strong.","Coming out of Mobile World Congress we saw a continued impressive memory growth in the low and mid range price phones segments as a number of customers announced products with 2 gigabytes of mobile DRAM a density historically found only in high-end smartphones. Our embedded solutions group recorded revenue of $365 million with continued strong operating margins of 16% which would have been higher if not impacted by I\/O charges in our NOR manufacturing network. These charges should wind down over the coming quarters. ESG had a record revenue for Q2 in the automotive segment.","On the product front we had greater than 40% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in AMC for the embedded market with NAND and low powered DRAM MCPs also growing in the industrial segment. We remain bullish on the market demand and confident in our product breadth as we drive our embedded business in Q3. Our Trade NAND revenue was over $1 billion in the quarter, up 11% as we continue the conversion of fab seven in Singapore from DRAM to NAND. This conversion is now essentially complete as of Q3 although we will have a small amount of legacy specialty DRAM remaining for another quarter or so.","As we mentioned on our last call this DRAM to NAND conversion necessitated a requalification of NAND material for products like SSD, consumer products and eMMC solutions. These qualifications are all independent on our customer\u2019s qualification cycles as well as timing related to product bills, and those can last a few quarters. The result is we end up with more products sold in component form compared to our long-term target for the NAND business.","We are continuing to shift our overall NAND production to our industry leading 16 nanometer technology which in our early ramp is shipping into consumer markets such as memory cards, USB storage devices and embedded consumer products. These transitions in our manufacturing output will enable a lower cost product mix in the future. We are currently in the qualification process at Q1 OEMs for our 20 nanometer M550 SSD products and anticipate shipping and volume for the back half of calendar 2014. Our Crucial branded M550 client SSD shipments will begin in volume in Q3.","Beyond SSDs our consumer product group had some major wins and new retail customers with Lexar branded USB and card products. Given current market pricing in the component channel, we feel these end markets will offer a better alternative than sell inventory in the NAND market. Despite some market softness in NAND, we remain optimistic on the long-term demand profile for the end market segments. Both from a unique growth and the density per unit perspective decline in enterprise SSD business continue to represent strong growth segments. NAND storage upgrades in the high-end smartphone market as well as unit and content growth in mid range smartphones fuel the overall mobile market at a large and growing consumer demand.","In addition, the consumer in embedded business are migrating from low density NAND and NOR applications to higher density flash memory. We remain focused on adding value to our NAND technology by building the right organization capabilities and skill sets to deliver premium NAND solutions to our customers. To that end, we are pleased to welcome Darren Thomas as our Vice President of Micron's Storage business unit. Darren most recently served as the Vice President of storage and networking products at Dell. He brings a unique customer perspective and understanding the different ways that market will utilize flash memory in the storage systems\u2019 architecture going forward.","We continue to invest in our underlying NAND technology as well. Our 16 nanometer NAND yields have been very positive and position us well from a cost perspective. We are currently planning to ship 60 nanometer to TLC in calendar Q4 in order to better position our portfolio from a cost perspective in the retail and consumer segments. We are excited about our 3D NAND technology aimed at higher performance applications, still targeting volume production planned for fiscal 2015. While our DRAM business is performing well, we are committed to improving our long-term margin structure of this business.","On the technology front, we are spending the migration of 25 nanometer and manufacturing beyond PC and mobile with a focus on server level quality with our top customers. Our 20 nanometer process migration DRAM is still on-track to commence at the end of this calendar year, all of which, which should improve our overall cost position in DRAM. Organizationally driven by our opportunity to serve a more diversified set of end markets, we\u2019ve implemented a new structure starting in Q3 aimed at better responding to application, market segment and customer specific requirements.","We will engage our customers through one or four market facing business units, computing and networking or CMBU, mobile MBU, storage SBU and embedded EBU. Tom Eby, who previous ran our embedded business is now going to lead the computing and networking business. Mike Rayfield will continue to lead our mobile business and Darren Thomas, as previously mentioned, will run the storage business. Jeff Bader, who has been the Vice President of Marketing for ESG has been promoted to run the embedded business unit.","In support of these market facing organizations we have set up three engineering groups including DRAM, non-volatile memory and advanced control development to help deliver the right customer and market specific products. The combination of the four market facing business units with the NAND engineering organization will form what we now call the memory solutions group which will be led by Brian Shirley and his new position as Vice President of Memory Solutions. We are confident this new organization will help us better react to unique customer requirements in a memory business which is increasingly solutions oriented. We continue to see overall good balance in the memory industry and we are investing in opportunities to differentiate our products and with our customers.","With that I will hand it back over to Kipp.","Kipp Bedard","Thanks Mark. We will now take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you\u2019re using a speaker phone please pick up the handset when asking a question so we can hear you clearly.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations for the results. I guess my first set of questions revolves around the NAND business, may be for Mark Adams. Mark, can you just help me understand a little bit better within the February quarter, you guys kind of significantly beat the bit production guidance you gave, but you sort of missed on the bit cost reduction. And I\u2019m just kind of curious the reason behind that typically you would expect that a bit production were higher perhaps cost would have been better, if you could help me understand that better that\u2019d be helpful?","Mark Adams","Typically as we\u2019ve made this conversion early ramp production cost going into our product costing it was pretty close to our guide for the quarter and we overall kind of are still ramping as I mentioned earlier we\u2019re not fully ramped the facility so we anticipate that there\u2019ll be continued improvements but at this point it\u2019s kind of the process of kind of ramping that facility in higher cost early stage.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","And then Mark a longer term question on NAND, as you think about where your margins are today versus your competitors. Can you talk about may be the two or three things that you need to do to bring your NAND margins up to kind of industry average?","Mark Adams","Sure I think that the things that we think about at Micron really are how we package our products and the innovation around control and firmware as it relates to not just SSD and storage but also eMMC and the mobile phone and embedded business and how we optimize those products. Secondly, we had a customer base that primarily was requiring MLC products in the past and our utilization of TLC in the future would be a big benefit to us. As I mentioned we expect to have our 16 nanometer TLC products in calendar Q4 into the channel.","And also I think that there are some interesting choices we\u2019ve made that were probably right for the time in the past, but when you look at a market like retail where now that\u2019s really two primary players we\u2019re seeing a pretty stable business than one that we like to continue to grow and so our market segmentation getting away from this component trade sales, if you will, to things like growing our retail, and our channel SSD business where it provides the margin and ASP uplift. Those were kind of two or three things I think are most important to us.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","And then guys my last quick question here on the DRAM front, you guys I think started server DRAM it\u2019s up pretty significantly year-over-year. I\u2019m kind of curious, the impact you guys see coming from end memory database. You saw Intel bring out a new class of Xeon chip, where really the only incremental benefit was how much DRAM it could address. You\u2019ve heard Oracle talk about having to put more DRAM into their data appliance tools. How big is that market today, and could that drive significantly better kind of enterprise, demand for DRAM that you guys are predicting right now?","Mark Adams","Yes, absolutely. And we think that we are pretty well positioned to take advantage of that. Not just for those relationships that you\u2019ve mentioned. But through advanced technology we\u2019re developing at Micron. So we see it as a pretty critical part of our overall strategy and we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on our product development.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Thanks guys, congratulations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks for taking my question. And along those lines for the server applications, the DDR4 announcement that you had, are you expecting to ship that for revenue in the June quarter, or in the May quarter?","Mark Durcan","Yes. We are targeting to ship that in early, volume material, in the quarter to commercial applications for our customers.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel Nicolaus","Is that sooner than you had expected?","Mark Durcan","No, right about what we thought.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And may be as you are moving from the 25 nanometer and starting with your 20 nanometer, what kind of cost reductions are you expecting from 25 nanometer to 20 nanometer?","Mark Durcan","Kevin, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it\u2019s pretty hard to do a year-over-year on these because these transitions are shifting out, so lengthy if you will, but generally if you take the process node changes, that\u2019s what you would ultimately get.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Yes thank you. Looking to production growth in NAND down high single-digits in May, I understand your response that this is through a strong, the longer SSD lead times but I am so surprised you go from up 35% in February which is quite pretty steep kind of growth each month to down high single-digits. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s happening there?","Mark Durcan","Yes I mean the biggest part for us is that we looked at the markets that we\u2019re serving, we take a look at that business and look at the opportunities to place these bits into the channel and what segments. And certainly SSDs offer us a larger cycle time as far as the product building and manufacturing and so that\u2019s driving a lot of it. To be honest with you, that\u2019s where we see our growth in terms of products. And I think it\u2019s being reflected in a much higher and improved performance in SSDs in Q3.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Okay great thanks and then, with the growth in the TLC that you\u2019ve talked about kind of being more aggressive in the back half; what are the markets that where you think you will see that deployed first for you?","Mark Durcan","Well I think today if you look at those markets, really for kind of high volume low-end consumer business, I do think that you will see eventually client SSDs and TLC are in the future, a lot of companies have been talking trying to develop that. We think we have a good path to that overtime. I think early application can mostly consumer and retail.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Great thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Thanks for taking my question. Could you provide more details regarding your share of Inotera and the loss on the Qimonda which you just talked about in the beginning, and could that mean that you will have to transfer the whole share? If you challenge that then how long do you think it could take to resolve this?","Mark Durcan","Yes Monika, since this is an ongoing case, I am not going to answer too many questions about that. But let me just reiterate. We believe the decision contains significant errors and that the proceedings were fundamentally flawed. I will give you an example, the Court heard only from trustee witnesses. No witnesses from Micron, no expert testimony. And so as I said before, we will definitely appeal. The other important thing that you should know is that the Inotera supply and technology relationship is not dependent on Micron\u2019s ownership of these shares. And so we have other shares that we own above and beyond these shares and whether we did or we didn\u2019t the relationship stands above and beyond the ownership.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Thanks and then just the last one on the NAND side, could you maybe talk about how much percentage of output is at 16 and how much at 20? And then when do you expect that -- I mean as in and you will do some low transition starting 2015 for 3D NAND still a kind would it be first half or second half 2015?","Mark Durcan","Well, I\u2019ve mentioned as 3D NAND was a 2015 shipment, within 2014 we\u2019re roughly in this profile market we\u2019re roughly about today during Q2 32% 25 nanometer, 60% 20 nanometer, and some of that SLC. In Q3, we intend to keep moving slightly towards a 20 nanometer mix.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Hi, guys congratulation on another solid and descent quarter here. I just had a couple of questions on the DRAM side obviously pricing very stable with dollar concerns but and the bit growth it\u2019s a little light, can you elaborate is that because of tech transitions or capacity?","Mark Durcan","The DRAM bit growth for us was kind of more because we had the conversion going on in Singapore, which when you have rated some of the other proven areas in process bit growth kind of gave us what we have to the quarter. So it\u2019s really a combination of the guidance we gave is pretty accurate relative to Q2 and it\u2019s really related on moving parts Singapore reducing and some of the process improvement elsewhere.","Mark Adams","And the situation I might just add with I\u2019ve mentioned the Hiroshima fab and we had a minor earthquake event and had a little bit short-term effort on it.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Got it. Thanks. On the NAND side what percent was SSD in the February quarter and you have mentioned you\u2019re increasing SSD output and what do you think the mix would be in SSD and NAND that\u2019s throughout May-August?","Mark Durcan","On our last call I had mentioned that the conversion process of the fab as a percentage of overall output would have a decreasing effect in Q2 and so it was in the single-digits in terms of our overall capacity SSD for NAND. We expect that to be much improved in Q3 relative to going up significantly in Q3 with both commercial OEM relationships as well as a channel. Somewhere almost approaching half of our NAND and NAND output getting back to us.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Alright, great thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I have is on the DRAM. Can you elaborate on the margin profile different between mobile and commodity?","Mark Durcan","Yes, both are pretty good.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Can you elaborate on that? What is the difference? Are they both the same level? Are you able to get the kind of margin that the mobile requires giving the die-size difference?","Mark Durcan","Yes, a good way to look at it. As you can go back and when we gave you Elpida specific data in Q1 and in August, that\u2019s a pretty representation of where and how good the mobile business can be and answer to your question PC is running just slightly behind that on the gross margin basis.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Okay, thank you. And then on the NAND side, can also elaborate on the mix of embedded NADN as overall NAND or as overall revenues?","Mark Durcan","Well embedded business as you can see kind of get a sense on the embedded business relative it\u2019s about proportional to what embedded business is to our top-line revenue. And then the NAND business kind of narrows that with embedded. And we\u2019re seeing emerging for that to growth in future but right now it\u2019s a nice proportion to our revenue.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Okay and then the one final question. It seems to me that the CapEx is pretty much back and loaded, is that correct Ron?","Ron Foster","A little bit, yes. As I mentioned we\u2019re still projected to be within our guidance range of 2.6 to 3.2. We ran about 560 million this quarter.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","But should we assume that you\u2019re going to hit the midpoint or more towards the low end given what\u2026","Ron Foster","I\u2019m not elaborating on the range yet that\u2019s the range we\u2019re giving you 2.6 to 3.2. I don\u2019t have refinement on that at this point.","Mehdi Hosseini - SIG","Okay thank so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the result. I was wondering if you could go beyond your guidance for you high single digits, down high single digit production estimates on NAND. I know that\u2019s a production estimate within considering fail would you expect there to be a greater decline than what you\u2019re producing a less because of MLC to TLC or mix factors? Thank you.","Mark Durcan","Alex just let me make sure that room understands your question. Are you asking for a little more detail on what we think the relationship between the sales bits versus the production guide can be?","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Correct, thank you.","Mark Adams","So, Alex it\u2019s Mark Adams, basically consistent with messages both at our Analyst Day and on prior calls we\u2019re going to look at this kind of from a what\u2019s the best return on our capacity and the decisions we\u2019re making around inventories. We look at the market conditions right now and we see some targets for stronger margins, and stronger ASPs and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to drive our product portfolio to do, within a given quarter we can have an impact on how much we sell and how much we direct of these different products opportunities, i.e. if we could ship the components into the consumer channel or to the spot market or if we ship them in SSDs and so we go through and look at the market conditions that\u2019s really what drives our choices so it\u2019s really nice if you\u2019re going to correlate what that\u2019s going to look like. Having said that, we look at the demand for those entire segments as very strong and even in Q3 we think that the actual systems level products find us a stage enterprise and some of consumer markets going to have a very strong quarter.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Okay, and is that somewhat should we think about that mixed benefit being something of a delta to add to the difference between what you\u2019re expecting from ASP declines and what you\u2019re expecting from cost declines. Should we not think of that as a one to one correlation because of those mixed factors you\u2019re talking about?","Ron Foster","Alex, this is Ron, I think the reason I gave you a view on sort of the trend of gross margin is we\u2019re trying to give you an overall perspective on the business, we have a lot of things to move around quarter-to-quarter between products and customer mix and it affects cost and ASP ranges but in general it will be down a couple of points on margin, and quarter-to-quarter, a NAND and that\u2019s probably the most complete way to give it to you. We have variability I mentioned in terms of SSD flow, we\u2019re actually ramping SSDs in the quarter and it\u2019s hard to call how much of that will move out in the quarter in your production versus sales question and how much flows into the next quarter but we\u2019re ramping and that\u2019s the important news.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Okay and real quick, DDR4 you said you will be shipping in May, what end markets are going to be taking that both in May and then maybe in the second half as well?","Ron Foster","Mostly networking and server customers.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Okay, very good, thanks so much, congratulations.","Ron Foster","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","","Thanks very much for taking the question. On the last call I know your team had talked to about not wanting to optimize margins in the short-term at the expenses from your long-term margins when you\u2019re after that, thinking about your overall capacity between DRAM and NAND. I think you guys have talked at that point about expecting NAND margin to catch back up to DRAM, we\u2019re discussing this. Now that the NAND margins per your guidance are a bit below where your DRAM margins are for next quarter, has the calculations changed at all in terms of thinking about the mix of your capacity between DRAM and NAND?","Mark Durcan","We don\u2019t want to try and react with too high a frequency to changes in the marketplace. When we make those kind of comments we\u2019re really talking about long-term decisions as opposed to short-term opportunities. Having said that, we\u2019re always maintaining flexibility in our business, particularly relative to segments and with a lower frequency relative to technologies.","Ron Foster","Guess the only thing I\u2019d add from a efficiency standpoint, we now have all of our Singapore operations essentially running on NAND and that gives us a real benefits in terms of operational efficiency and cost going forward, and that\u2019s also the strategic decision.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and I think you guys have talked about having some 3D NAND samples out this year, can you give us an update on how that\u2019s progressing?","Mark Durcan","Yes, we have very good progress I think on our 3D NAND technology. We\u2019re very excited we\u2019ve got the functional components with very strong device characteristics and talking about things like Window budgets and the tightness of our programming levels etc, so we\u2019re very, very excited about it. We decided that we\u2019re not going to sample for now, we like our relative competitive position and where we are relative to what we hear others might be. And so we\u2019re going till we\u2019re a little closer to volume production before, we unnecessarily expose ourselves by getting samples out there in the market place.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much and good luck.","Mark Durcan","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Galvin with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Thomas Galvin - Raymond James","","Thanks. On that subject of 3D NAND what\u2019s the motivation for not sampling at the moment, you still don\u2019t want to show your open the common if you will for the competition?","Mark Durcan","Well our focus is going to be to deliver system level 3D NAND products and putting a bunch of non-enabled components out in the market place right now for our competitors to see is of limited value. I think we want to wait till a little bit closer to where we those system level solutions enabled and then of course we\u2019ll be working closely with our most valued customers to make sure they understand what\u2019s coming down the pipe and the value we can deliver for and with it.","Thomas Galvin - Raymond James","And can you share with us how many layers you have on your 3D NAND approach?","Mark Durcan","No, that\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re not wanting to share right now.","Thomas Galvin - Raymond James","Okay and just one last one on 3D, if you could provide industry dynamic in terms of the overall ramp of 3D NAND. Is it as expected, slower than expected, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","I think it\u2019s about as we\u2019ve been indicating for Micron it\u2019s maybe slower than some of the early noise was. We still anticipate will be in the marketplace late this year, but the impact of the marketplace is not really until second half \u201915 and maybe with some folks I thinks further talk a little late in that even now.","Thomas Galvin - Raymond James","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Hey guys sorry if I missed it. I just wondering on the OpEx guide for the May quarter, can you help me understand the increase on the down revenue quarter, is this just that you\u2019re pulling in some project or how do I think about the OpEx level?","Ron Foster","Well, John this is Ron. The OpEx guide is generally in line with our run rate for the quarter, this most recent quarter maybe up a little bit higher and that\u2019s usually a function of wafer calls on the R&D side. We were 344 in Q2 and regarding 345 to 355 that just typically wafer call cost and that sort of thing that\u2019s cycled differently each quarter. And then SG&A we\u2019re right in there with 177 was this quarter and we\u2019re guiding 170 to 180.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","And then Mark I think you\u2019ve said in the calendar fourth quarter that you would expect to be shipping TLC, is that intend to enterprise SSD as well can you talk a little bit about controller technology around TLC?","Mark Durcan","John, my point earlier was that initial applications for our 60 nanometer TLC components will be more consumer and retail oriented upfront. To-date no one has had a lot of success even on the client side enabling TLC memory. There is a lot of work being done and your question around controller development is a good one because I think that\u2019s where the error correction and capabilities around enabling TLC to be reliable enough to ship in that segment. But we still think that\u2019s kind of a 2015 calendar year phenomenon, we don\u2019t see that happening in large scale in calendar \u201914.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC. Your line is open.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question guys and congratulation on a strong quarter. Can you give me a sense of what your inventory plan might be for next quarter?","Mark Durcan","Sure, this quarter as you can see our inventory was flat and as we look at inventory we\u2019ve kind of communicated this message and one good chance do it again, we\u2019re looking at this business from returns perspective and not looking to hit some arbitrary inventory numbers in a given quarter. Even the DRAM business it\u2019s pretty tight right now, so.","Ron Foster","Really tight.","Mark Durcan","Really tight, so we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re in a position that we\u2019re going to be holding back inventory. We\u2019ve got customers who need us to support them and it\u2019s pretty healthy market. The NAND business as we\u2019ve talked about earlier we\u2019re going to make choices around the customer relationships and the product opportunities, but we\u2019re going to resist the temptation to hit again a predefined number and inventory. We\u2019re going to run the business to make money and we\u2019re going to run it through the right products and that\u2019s kind of an ongoing process we\u2019re going to do.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","When I look forward, if you could, so far you guys have been pretty good in the last couple of quarters about hitting the numbers, have you reconsidered whether or how close are we to getting actual guidance going forward?","Mark Durcan","Yes Doug it\u2019s a good question and we\u2019ve talked in the past this is something we are constantly reviewing and I think we believe that\u2019s going to be appropriate at some point. We\u2019re not ready to do it just yet.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","And I guess my last question; it does appear and you\u2019ve talked about your qualifications that are necessary in NAND, I\u2019m seeing some signs that there is definitely different qualities of NAND out in the market, can you maybe talk about whether there is any concern on your part that the quality of your product there in the market might not be reflective of the quality that you can deliver in the future? And does that run the risk of having any potential of damaging your brand?","Mark Durcan","Well, we kind of feel pretty strong about what we\u2019ve delivered. This is being a new category. Customers over the last couple of years have been working with something like Micron to make this world-class quality level technology they can bring to both desktop and to the enterprise. Having said that, we\u2019ve invested a lot in quality especially in the SSD place and our NAND performance had been actually coming from key enterprise customers as the higher performing NAND in the market. So as we look at our business, we learn a lot the new category but we feel pretty strong about our technology and our products. The areas we\u2019ve invested the most for example PCIe, we\u2019ve had the highest performance products in the market. So from a reliability standpoint, we don\u2019t see that as a something that we\u2019re explaining anything about the past. We think it\u2019s been a pretty good quality opportunity for us to grow and to learn about system level solutions. And we think, we need a strong product development in the future.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great. If I could sneak one last one on the DRAM front. In last quarter you talked quite a bit about shipping in wafer format, I believe the demand for wafer format is dropping a little bit. How do we think about the trade off of maybe bit growth for those wafers versus margin? How much of delta is there in wafer sales versus component sales and what type of impact does that have on the bit growth numbers?","Ron Foster","The margin on the known good die that Mark mentioned is better which is why we took advantages of it over the last couple of quarters. We\u2019re going to ship . I think you\u2019re right in characterizing that. We\u2019ll probably ship fewer of those types of wafers which all of that wrapped in by the ways because I\u2019m getting some questions on some of the guidance we had adds to this mix effect on in terms of bit growth and cost downs. But I think you\u2019ve characterized it right that the known good die program is more profitable for us than packaged parts. And we have had a pretty strong market for about six months to ship more and more wafers into that. And I think now we\u2019re going to probably back off that just little bit. But as Mark and Mark both alluded to, we\u2019re actually shifting mix into customers that are drastically needed and be in short shift today. So there is plenty of homes for where we mix DRAM will continue to maximize margin with us.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks for taking all my questions.","Mark Durcan","Good Doug. And I think we have time for one more.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities","Congratulation on the quarter and thanks so much for squeezing me in. You guys talked about how tight the DRAM supply is and as you guys are looking forward and your competitor continues to bring production online and supply and demand coming more in balance, how are you guys looking at gigabyte content in PCs, are we going to see an increase in that given that things have been so tight and they have been having a hard time getting components?","Mark Durcan","Yes, Betsy for the first time we\u2019re seeing the third-party data that suggest about a 12% to 15% increase in content this year. So the numbers would look something like last year\u2019s average of about 4.3 gigabytes going to about 4.9 this year.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities","Okay great and thanks for taking my questions and congratulations getting on the quarter.","Mark Durcan","Thank you.","Ron Foster","And thank you all.

Bedard","And now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Mark Durcan. Mark?","D. Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter followed by a few strategic and industry updates. Then I'll turn over to Ron for financial summary, and we'll close with Mark Adams discussing key developments in our business unit and operations, as well as an update on market conditions.","Our first fiscal quarter was somewhat a tumultuous one as we dealt with shifting market demand and internal operations disruptions. Mark will discuss some of the market shifts in more detail later, but at a high level, we continue to see significant growth and opportunity in the products supporting mobile platforms and embedded applications including, of course, SSDs in a more muted environment in personal systems.","Our sales volume for both NAND and DRAM was below our initial forecast for the quarter as we experienced some manufacturing and supply-chain challenges. We are confident these issues have been addressed and will not negatively impact fiscal Q2.","As you\u2019ll have noted in the release, revenue for the quarter was down about 7% as a result of a 9% decline in DRAM sales and a 4% decline in NAND. Despite generally declining ASPs, gross margins were up slightly quarter-over-quarter with improvements in NAND and NOR partially offset by reductions in DRAM.","NAND market prices were up early in the period and trended downwards towards the end of the quarter, although recently, prices seemed to have stabilized. You may recall that our estimated quarter-to-date ASP included the -- including the forecasted mix for the quarter was down mid-teens as a result of our last earnings call -- as of our last earnings call. Prices did stabilized and, in some cases, improved later in the quarter, and this trend has continued into the current quarter. It will continue to be important to contemplate the effects of Micron's specific product mix as it relates to Micron's ASPs as we move through the year.","During the quarter, we continued our efforts to streamline the business and focus our team on actions and investments that will either improve our efficiency and cost structure or our ability to deliver leading-edge innovative memory solutions. To this end, we have discontinued most activity into our Solid-State Lighting Program and then moving this program toward a technology-licensing model.","We continue to look at ways to streamline all our manufacturing operations including our 8-inch front-end capacity and our back-end operations, particularly as necessary to accommodate any future front-end capacity.","As we mentioned at our fall Analyst Day, we remain in discussions with our partners in Taiwan regarding changes to our agreements, including those related to Inotera supply and our joint development relationship. Although there's no assurance when or if the deal will happen, we don't currently believe the outcome will significantly impact our Q2 guidance for bit growth, estimated quarter-to-date ASP, which includes forecasted mix for the quarter, or R&D spending. Until we finalize terms of any changes to our agreements, I'm not able to add any further details, any potential impact, any new agreements may have in the future beyond those statements relative to our fiscal Q2.","We are making and will continue to make the strategic choices to align our business strategy and operating model to deliver an optimum value and return for our shareholders through efficient manufacturing and value-added memory solutions.","Relative to the Elpida acquisition, the Tokyo District Court has submitted Micron's proposed reorganization plan to the Elpida creditors, and they expect to complete the voting phase by the end of February. In addition, we have entered Phase 1 review in China and continue to work towards government approval of all the required countries. We expect to close sometime in the first half of 2013.","In terms of the memory market, we're cautious in the short term but optimistic about the evolving industry supply-demand balance. The industry DRAM supply outlook continues to be favorable. We don't see any substantial new wafer capacity coming to the market, and the latest process technology transitions are simply going to take longer compared to previous generations.","The other key variable on DRAM supply is industry capacity shifting away from PC to higher growth categories including mobile and server. This shift results in fewer bits produced in aggregate and should eventually result in a more favorable supply-demand balance in PC DRAM as well.","The outlook is also encouraging on the NAND front. We don't see any significant capacity additions to the market in 2013. And as with DRAM, process technology migrations are getting stretched out, which is -- which has the effect of reducing supply growth compared to prior years while demand growth remains robust driven by SSDs, smartphones and tablets.","Our technology development and product portfolio is targeting these key segments as we head into 2013, and we are confident about our position in the market. I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.","Ronald C. Foster","Thanks, Mark. While we're rapidly approaching the end of 2012 calendar year, Micron completed the first quarter of fiscal 2013 on November 29. On our website, we have provided a schedule, as usual, containing certain key results for the first quarter, as well as certain guidance for the second quarter. That material is also presented on a few slides that follow.","The first quarter resulted with a net loss of $275 million or $0.27 per diluted per share on net sales of $1,834,000,000. These results compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year of a net loss of $243 million or $0.24 per diluted share on net sales of $1,963,000,000. Total sales in the first quarter were 7% lower than the previous quarter, driven primarily by declines in DRAM and NAND.","You will recall that we entered into a series of currency options to mitigate the exposure to changes in the yen denominated purchase price of Elpida prior to the close of that acquisition. The weaker yen at the end of the first quarter relative to when we signed the sponsor agreement would have decreased the U.S. dollar equivalent purchase price if we'd closed the transaction at quarter end.","The weaker yen also reduced the fair value of the options we entered into at the time of signing. The resulting mark-to-market adjustment of the options resulted in a $62 million loss in the first quarter. Approximately, $9 million of this loss was the reversal of a gain recognized in the previous quarter as a result of a strengthening yen across that period.","During the first quarter, with the termination of Transform Solar's operations, the fab facility previously leased the Transform reverted back to Micron. A $25 million gain was recognized in other operating income associated with the release from that lease obligation. The $54 million net interest expense includes $29 million of noncash interest expense from imputed interest on the bifurcated convertible notes that we have  outstanding.","Trade NAND bit sales in the first quarter decreased compared to the prior fourth quarter. As Mark indicated, we experienced some manufacturing challenges in the quarter, which reduced output in Q1. Trade NAND average selling prices increased approximately 8% comparing the first quarter to the previous quarter as we continue to sell more NAND in the premium segments with higher ASPs, such as SSD and MCPs.","Estimated trade NAND selling prices are down high single digits quarter-to-date, including the forecasted product mix for the quarter. Trade NAND cost per bit is expected to be down high single digits in the second quarter, while trade NAND bit productions plan to be up low teens in the second quarter as our 20-nanometer wafer output doubles compared to Q1.","DRAM revenue in the first quarter decreased 9% compared to the previous quarter, primarily as a result of an 11% decrease in DRAM average selling prices stemming primarily from weaker PC segment demand relative to the fourth quarter. Quarter-to-date selling prices, including projected mix impact for the quarter, are down double digits compared to the Q1 average. We anticipate the Q2 mix will be somewhat heavier to personal systems.","DRAM cost per bit declined approximately 5% quarter-to-quarter, and we are forecasting bit cost for DRAM in the second quarter to be down low double digits as we continue to transition to our 4 GB DDR3 product set, which comprised approximately 1\/3 of the DRAM bit sales in the first quarter. Bit production in the second quarter is expected to be up double digits compared to the first quarter.","NOR sales were relatively flat in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and remained at approximately 12% of total revenue. NOR revenues second quarter is expected to decrease seasonally, approximately 10% compared to the first quarter. We anticipate NOR cost reductions to offset selling price reductions in the second quarter.","SG&A expense in the first quarter was below our guided range as a result of lower costs associated with pending legal matters and lower personnel costs from our variable pay plans. During the first quarter, certain variable pay plans were suspended resulting in cost reductions across our global operations. We expect SG&A expense in the second quarter to be between $135 million and $145 million.","R&D expense was $224 million in the first quarter and is expected to be between $220 million and $230 million in the second quarter. The company generated $236 million in cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter. First quarter ended with cash and investments including noncurrent investments of just over $2.8 billion. Expenditures for property plant and equipment in the first quarter were $538 million, and we still expect total expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, slightly weighted towards the earlier part of the fiscal year.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. Mark?","Mark W. Adams","Thanks, Ron. Our NAND Solutions Group declined slightly from the fourth quarter. The slight improvement in operating margin for NSG was primarily due to reduced costs in the first quarter associated with the ramp of products on our 20-nanometer process and improved product mix. In addition, our trade NAND pricing was up 8% for the quarter. As NAND has historically been somewhat seasonal, we will be watching post holiday demand signals closely.","We continue to be pleased with our solid state drive business as bit shipments were up about 20% quarter-on-quarter. In Q1, SSDs represented 17% of our trade NAND business. If you include NAND component sales to SSD providers, about 35% of our trade NAND bits go into solid state drives.","Our development of Enterprise-class SSDs is progressing well. We completed the qualification with the leading enterprise networking customer of our P400E drive with volume shipments scheduled in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. We're also nearing qualification of our next-generation enterprise SATA drive with major server and storage OEM customers and look for shipments in calendar year 2013 as well.","Our SLC-based PCIe P320 H enterprise high-performance storage drive continues to receive positive reviews from both the press and our top customers.","On the NAND technology front, we are making steady technical advancements with both our planar and 3D NAND technologies. We began sampling our 20-nanometer TLC NAND flash, which selected controller companies, and we'll begin production in calendar Q1.","We saw a slowdown in our 20-nanometer ramp related to the manufacturing issues described earlier, but we still expect production crossover in 3 to 6 months. MLC represented about 80% to 85% of our wafer production in Q1, with SLC and TLC essentially splitting the remainder.","Sales for our DRAM Solutions Group in the first quarter reflects slight growth in bit sales volumes eclipsed by decline in selling prices, particularly in the personal systems segment. Despite the lower revenue in the quarter, our operating income line was roughly flat due to lower R&D costs for product qualifications as certain products reach production status in the fourth quarter and are now ramping.","While we look for demand drivers such as ultrathin and light notebooks and Windows 8 to stimulate demand in the desktop\/notebook segment, we continue our focus on specialty markets such as server, networking, graphics and consumer devices.","The networking segment represents about 25% of our DSG revenue. We had another strong quarter and made progress to expand beyond the traditional large OEM [Audio Gap] businesses to smaller customers and distributors in the sale of our networking portfolio.","A growing portion of the market is shifting from DDR2 to DDR3-based systems, and we also continue to see early traction for our RLDRAM 3 and Hybrid Memory Cube.","We continue to see very strong demand signals from our server customers. 2000 server bit -- 2013 server bit growth year-on-year is forecasted to grow over 40%, and we remain confident we will drive growth in the category.","From a product perspective, we added a major new technology to our portfolio with nonvolatile DIMM target mission-critical in memory database applications. Overall, we are positioned well for long-term success in the server segment.","On the DRAM operation front, we project to hit bit crossover on 30-nanometer in Q2. We are conscious that as an industry, there are increasing strength challenges to ramp 20- and 30-nanometer nodes as seen as well by our competitors. We are currently forecasting Micron's 20-nanometer transition rate in calendar year 2013.","PCO and DRAM pricing stabilized in the second half of our Q1 and is up high single to low double digits so far in December. While it's too early to signal a sustainable trend in terms of improved pricing, we will monitor the tightening supply situation in the market, as well as the seasonality effect on demand. General inventories seem to have returned to normalized level of 3 to 4 weeks down from where we entered the quarter.","Sales by the Wireless Solutions Group improved seasonality in the first quarter. New configurations of NAND-DRAM multi-chip packages showed strength in the China mobile market while new DRAM product introductions began to ramp as well. While we continue to be challenged on the bottom line for WSG, we remain bullish about our long-term opportunities in Wireless.","Mobile DRAM shipments increased significantly as we were leveraging the ramp of our 30-nanometer base 4-gigabit low-power DDR2 device in both the entry level and high-end smartphone category. We also have strong growth in NAND shipments, most noticeably in the low-end smartphone market which is seeing a transition from standalone NAND to EMCP-based solutions, with e\u00b7MMC NAND combined with low-power DRAM. Wireless NOR shipments grew double digits, and gross margins were up nicely in the quarter as a result of cost improvements.","Our broad product portfolio combining DRAM, NAND and NOR puts us in a great position to capture a larger share of the Wireless market as we move forward with the focus on growth in DRAM and NAND in particular. The addition of the Elpida's mobile DRAM portfolio will only accelerate this effort.","Our Embedded Solutions Group had a record quarter in terms of gross profit and operating income driven by the ramp of 45-nanometer parallel NOR and continued strength in the automotive and industrial segments.","We delivered the first customer sample of the 45-nanometer serial NOR and began engineering wafers for 300-millimeter embedded NOR products. One of the particular areas of strength has been the growth of our embedded e\u00b7MMC product portfolio. We ramped volume production of automotive products and expanded density offerings of the industrial lineup.","We continue to invest in infrastructure and headcount resources to accelerate our embedded growth. In the past year, we opened up engineering systems labs in Munich and Shanghai for joint development and validation; continuing our focus on providing customer-centric solutions and, in many cases, sitting right next to customer design teams. We have advanced our NOR technology leadership with our 45-nanometer 300-millimeter production, and we'll continue to leverage this position to generate profitable growth.","Pricing in the embedded space remains stable, and we were able to drive our cost leadership position to improving margins. While we continue to face adverse conditions during our first quarter, we are making progress on a number of fronts. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day conference in October, we are exclusively focused on being the leader in the memory market. Our cash position remains strong as we continue to be operating cash flow positive in Q1. Our inventory remains in check, down from $2 billion within the last 9 months, and we are focused on improving our cost efficiency.","Our premium businesses, such as specialty DRAM, SSDs and Embedded Solutions continue to represent growth opportunities for Micron. Our management team continues to work on integration plans as we prepare for the close of our Elpida transaction. We remain optimistic that the reduced capital spending with no new memory fabs on the horizon will lead us to better memory supply and demand dynamics. Our customers have been extremely supportive of the acquisition and Micron's overall strategy. We believe end markets such as mobile, server, networking, enterprise and embedded will continue to drive strong demand for our products.","With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.","Kipp A. Bedard","Thank you, Mark. What we'd like to do now is take questions from callers [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could go into little more details of the manufacturing problem and how comfortable you are that the problem is fixed going into the second quarter?","Mark W. Adams","Yes, Kevin, this is Mark. I don't want to get into too much detail. But I think I could characterize it as really nothing out of the ordinary in terms of the root cause, a combination of different events in front-end, back-end manufacturing, some internal, some external. I think in concert with some knock-on effects that the disruptions created in our overall supply chain really just led to inability to get all the products out. Relative to are we convinced that the problems are behind us, absolutely, relative to those particular issues. I'm not here to promise you we'll never have a manufacturing disruption again, but I think the -- what we encountered this quarter was really sort of a perfect storm in terms of the timing of a number of different events that cumulatively created the issue.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe just to understand, you said that in the second quarter, you're expecting heavier personnel systems on the DRAM side. Is that normal seasonality it seems like that would normally be a weak quarter or servers just got much worse?","Ronald C. Foster","Kevin, this is Ron. The effect here is basically as we were looking at quarter, we had an opportunity to pick some -- up some additional wafers from Inotera. And our conclusion was that, that would marginally improve our gross margin dollars, our gross profit dollars if you will. And so we decide to take that increment, and that is incrementing our PC bits and affected our guidance in terms of what we gave you.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's not the end markets that are shifting at all, just...","Ronald C. Foster","No. It was a mix of just the opportunities we saw in front of us and the ability to pick up some wafers that added a few more dollars to the cash balance.","Mark W. Adams","Yes, and I'd like to make one announcement, too. On the guidance sheet that -- for those of you who are looking at it, you may have an error on the R&D column that lists R&D for the quarter as $1.8 billion. The actual numbers, as Ron has reported, was $224 million. So you will get a corrected version of that sent out within the minutes here. But the corrected R&D number for fiscal Q1 was $224 million. So with that, we'd like to go back to questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Monika Garg of Pacific Quest.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","First question on the DRAM side. So Mark Adams talked about PC OEM DRAM pricing stabilizing during the second half and actually up low double digit in December, but you are guiding DRAM pricing down quarter-to-date low double digits. Just trying to reconcile the 2.","D. Mark Durcan","Basically, the effect you're seeing has to do with just the overall mix and where the bits are going. So the PC bits, which tend to be on the lower side of our pricing that we attained, there'll be more of those PC bits, and that's the overall mix effect will drag that pricing downward.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And recently, we have seen in the news and the media that Nanya may not be buying PC DRAM chips from Inotera. And you're also guiding that you are buying some of that capacity. So given that Inotera is a JV between Micron and Nanya, could this lead to increased expenses to Inotera's operations from Micron?","Mark W. Adams","I think we said all we can say relative to any potential or hypothetical deal we might reach, we've told you that we are having discussions with our partners, and we've told you how that has -- what we can relative to how that impacts our Q2 guidance. And I think the bottom line is that the bits we are currently forecasting are what we believe will happen in Q2. And obviously, we'll do a deal if we think it makes sense for Micron.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just one last one on NAND side. Could you talk about NAND bit supply growth for both Micron and where do you think NAND industry bit supply growth could be for calendar 2013?","Mark W. Adams","I could start with the industry part, and then I will let Mark jump in with the Micron part. But we're looking at a calendar 2013 based on public information of probably somewhere between 35% and 45%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could go back to the production issue that you had. So you said you have front-end and back-end, but how were yields with your 20-nanometer? There were no issues there? Are things still tracking in line with your expectations?","Ronald C. Foster","Well, relative to 30-nanometer, generally speaking, we made fantastic progress on yields as we move through the quarter and anticipate a continued trend as we move into -- as we move through fiscal Q2. Relative to 20-nanometer, that's actually insignificant piece of our total -- of our output today.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, then can you -- I guess, as we look at 30-nanometer to 20-nanometer transition, how that's going to look?","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, it'll be -- the transition is really starting late in calendar '13. And you could expect that transition to continue through calendar 2014. It's generally on track with what we've been forecasting and timing in line with what we believe the rest of the industry will be.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then you guys mentioned that you, on the Wireless Solutions Group, you're challenged on the operating profit there. And I was wondering if you could help us understand how things are going to get better in that marketplace when we're seeing sort of a shift to more NAND solutions versus NOR Flash solutions.","Mark W. Adams","Betsy, this is Mark Adams. Yes, the -- first of all, correct me I...","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, sorry. The prior comments that Mark mentioned I think...","Mark W. Adams","Were relative to DRAM.","Mark W. Adams","I think were relative to DRAM. Is that what you were asking, Betsy, around the DRAM, 20-nanometer?","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Well, yes. And then I was also asking about the Wireless Solutions Group.","Mark W. Adams","Okay, good. So just -- on the Wireless Solutions side, the -- there's a couple of factors that are playing into the options for us. One is the, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, our 30-nanometer LPDDR 3, 4-gigabit part has put us in a very competitive position today, and that is ramping in volume so we can go out and expand our offering there. Secondly, the maturity of our e\u00b7MMC product portfolio is opening doors for new sockets as well there. So between the combination of those 2, not only do we get back in the game from a cost perspective but we have a broader product portfolio to bring to market and actually deliver on.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then my last question, I apologize if you mentioned this, but when we're looking at the estimates for SG&A, I see it's going up to $135 million to $145 million. And it's not just FICA and things like that, that were causing your SG&A to go up.","Mark W. Adams","There's a couple of things. One is we had a -- we're getting back to normal trend line, if you look at our history in terms of SG&A. We had a lower legal expenses in the first quarter. And also we've got some integration costs as we're looking forward to the acquisition that we're -- that we've got a net estimate as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Chin of UBS.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Couple of questions on the inventory front. I heard the comments on DRAM channel inventory looking better. But with the anticipated sales of -- or increased sales of PC DRAM for fiscal 2Q, do you think that channel inventory will increase again in the current quarter or do you think there's enough sell-through of bits that that will stay under control?","Ronald C. Foster","I think -- we do think though those are bitsthat would normally go to the PC market indirectly or directly, so we think it's net neutral.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And on the NAND side, just given that flash about this time last year, I think your solid state drive business also saw some inventory buildup. What kind of trends are you seeing there right now in terms of\u2026","Mark W. Adams","I think if you go back a year ago, if we go back a year ago, we were coming out at an artificially higher demand curve due to the hard drive situation in Thailand prior to the holidays. I think that effect's gone, and we're pretty bullish. We're trying to grow our SSD business, and the demand signals from our customers are in parallel aligned with that. So we were pretty bullish going into our second quarter on SSDs.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And the last question is in terms of the manufacturing issues in Q1 and how that may have impacted your ability to shift product, was there any business out of the front table in Q1 that you'll be able to make up in Q2?","Ronald C. Foster","There's a very small amount of growth in bit inventory that was offset with cost of good reductions. So when you look at inventory numbers, they're relatively flat. So some of that will come through, but it's a -- it's not as significant relative to the overall quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on the move in DRAM spot pricing we've seen. In your view, is that purely due to some of your competitors taking PC DRAM supply offline? And then what kind of impact have you seen in your specialty DRAM businesses on the server or mobile side? Is some of that capacity moving over to those places which is causing the pricing pressure or have you seen a stabilization there?","Ronald C. Foster","Overall, I think that the PC DRAM pricing has to do with the overall supply picture in the overall industry when you look at the market. So I think that the supply side -- and we've referenced kind of what's out in the public on production and investment and capacity and technology transitions, we think that it's been relatively conservative in terms of overall supply growth. So the PC number we think is just kind of a natural evolution of the last 12 to 18 months of that behavior. I think your follow-on comments, did some of those bits make it into our specialty businesses. And while we can't predict that won't happen in the future, we haven't seen it as much because it is not as a matter of just redirecting that capacity. There are technical specifications that go along with it, along -- whether it be performance or temperature requirements and those types of things that, that capacity doesn't automatically become perishable or transferable to other segments. So we haven't seen tremendous pressure. Now having said that, I'll make one qualification to that. We have seen kind of a newer segment in the servers come up that it's a little bit more of a commoditized server for the data center application, the cloud data center application where it's been more of a higher unit but more of a kind of industry standard architecture that doesn't have those specifications, we view that as net-net positive because those bits are better than the PC bits and they're additive to our core server business.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-on, any update for us on how you see the DRAM industry bit supply in calendar 2013?","Ronald C. Foster","Right now, it shapes up to be somewhere, Jim, between 20% and 30%.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. And then finally, for me, on the Wireless Group operating profit, can you comment on maybe the difference between the reported operating profit and the actual cash flow out of that group? And maybe highlight any actions you might take to kind of to improve that profitability level going forward?","Ronald C. Foster","James, this is Ron. The -- when you look at cash flow of Wireless Group versus the reported result, the main difference is depreciation\/amortization, which affects all of our main business units, if that's the question you're asking. So it's a contributor to the operating cash flow based upon the depreciation component that\u2019s COGS. I'm not sure if that's the question you're asking, though.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if there's any acquisition-related one-timers that would kind of be above and beyond the pure equipment depreciation effect?","Ronald C. Foster","No, not material.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you remind us if the Elpida deal closes on the terms you expect and the timeframe you expect, what your cash requirements might be to support this transaction? And given the current revenue and income statement dynamics, will you need to raise any extra cash or do you have what you need on the balance sheet at the moment?","Ronald C. Foster","In terms of the actual purchase price at close, it was about $750 million in cash that we have to come up with. And you can see the cash balance on our financial statement, we're obviously opportunistically looking at financing situations. The market is pretty good right now, but as we've said before, we tend to look at ones that are covenant-free and focused more on capital leases, which is a normal course of business kind activity as our primary focus. But we'll continue to look at opportunities also to spread our debt exposure over time, our repayment schedule as well, but it's opportunistic based upon market availability.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And my other question is you were saying that you expect your DRAM mix to be somewhat heavier towards personal systems, so are you seeing a pickup in demand of systems, I assume you may mean PCs by that, or is there some other dynamic that pushes down your demand for your specialty DRAM?","Ronald C. Foster","Yes. The comment was in terms of additional DRAM bits related to the fact that we actually have more availability of bit supply, and so we have more to move into the market. It's not a demand-driven factor. It's basically supply we have available.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Goodman of CLSA.","Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","A bit of a follow-up to that last point on the decision to take some of those additional wafers out of the Elpida and go in to the PC market. How do you balance the risk of potential impact to pricing versus the opportunities there? I mean, maybe you could talk about some of the opportunities you see by geography or by segment within the market that help lead to that decision?","Ronald C. Foster","This is Ron. I'll take the first part, maybe Mark and Mark wants to comment on sort of market opportunities. This is a short-term kind of thing that happens periodically. It just happened to be a little bit larger this quarter where there are available wafers from Inotera. And we have an election to actually pick them up or not pick them up, and it's a straightforward economic analysis based upon current market conditions and known potential we have with our market pricing and contractual arrangements with our customers. So we make the decision based on the cash evaluation, and we made the decision to take some in this case.","Mark W. Adams","But in addition to that, if you -- the comments made in our opening discussion around PC OEM pricing, I think the market and the supply base reflects an adjustment of what CT capacity looks like. And so while the overall PC segment doesn't look like a significant growth category, if it's flat, the supply base to that has already kind of contemplated that. We believe that the supply and demand curve is in better shape as reflected by the OEM contract price increases in December.","Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just another question, this one on the NAND side of things, specifically on client SSDs. I know one of your competitors appears to be making a stronger push in the 3-bit lately, and even has a 3-bit SSD out there. And at the same time, we're seeing another competitor kind of moving in the opposite direction and pushing a little more 2-bit and going more into smartphones and 2-bit SSDs. I'm curious, I know in recent conference, you had mentioned the possibility of 3-bit SSD. But maybe if you could just provide some color on the strategy there going forward?","Ronald C. Foster","Sure. A lot of it depends on the customer and the application you're selling to. We see over time the client SSD business as it continues to scale, and its growth is encouraging. We see kind of the value of different product offerings within client. When you're selling to a major OEM customer, a 3-bit solution won't quite do it. If you're selling to a white box emerging market segment that might accept lower than that type of performance, you might get that -- be able to get there. The other side of the maturity of controller development being able to handle 3-bit will continue to improve. And so do we think in the future that 3-bit per sale SSDs would be viable? Yes. Do we think the market is there today? Probably not, and that's why we continue to focus on performance, high-performance client SSD drives.","Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Just one quick follow-up too on the manufacturing issues. Did that only affect NAND volume or was that also -- was that an impact to DRAM volume as well?","Ronald C. Foster","It hit both sides.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Couple of questions here. First of all, as we look at the -- your product mix in both DRAM and NAND, I mean that's been changing here in the past few quarters, how should we be looking at that in the next -- in this fiscal year '13? I mean, what -- should we see your SSD bits growing to potentially 50% of your total NAND or is it kind of mid-30s right now? Is that where you stand in the same question relative to specialty DRAM and PC DRAM?","Ronald C. Foster","I think it's fair to say we don't think 30% the ceiling on SSD bits both part of our portfolio and our SSD pure play customers. So I don't think we're satisfied nor do we think that's the top. We think there's more opportunity, and in fact, that's kind of where we're driving a lot of our go-to-market and development resources.","Mark W. Adams","And in terms of trying to pin down for you what percent of our business can be NAND and DRAM, we're going to try and keep that to ourselves for now.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of your Wireless side, I mean you focused a lot on your Analyst Day and since then as well, and focusing on finding ways to penetrate more of the handset market. What can you give us in terms of update, in terms of your product portfolio and your traction that you're getting as you turn around this Wireless segment in terms of getting more content in the smartphone space?","Ronald C. Foster","Well, I think I'll kind of revert back to my earlier comments. We were out of 2 key portions of the business as far as growth opportunities within Wireless, one being low-power DRAM Solutions, which hit us both on the standalone sale of that product, as well as the MCP, as well as our e\u00b7MMC offering. And both those product development efforts have progressed really well, and we haven't lacked access to the market. I think what we look at -- in one case, cost position when we were driving too hard to sell that volume in that space and another capability that our e\u00b7MMC offering wasn't as mature as the -- as all of our customers would've liked. So we've kind of say today that we have confidence and our products are competitive and able to gain that share of market that we want.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And just final question on your NOR business, I mean there's been some news lately that your plans for the fab in Israel, what can you update us on the strategy of your NOR business, I mean in terms of the roadmap here?","Ronald C. Foster","Well, I think that the -- again, we mentioned a bit earlier, we continue to invest in NOR from a technology perspective. We are a leader right now with our 45-nanometer, 300-millimeter product, which gives us a pretty good cost advantage in that business that showed up in the embedded space. And to some extent, it will help us also enable us in the lower end wireless sockets. You made reference to manufacturing rumors that are in the press, and so on and so forth. But what I would say to that is that we still remain very, very committed to NOR. It's a good part of our business an enabling technology for us both in embedded and wireless and from other segments as well, including PC bios applications and consumer applications.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glen Yeung of Citigroup.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you guys have a forecast for us what CapEx could be next quarter?","Ronald C. Foster","This is Ron. As I mentioned, we're still projecting $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion for the year. We had about $538 million in the first quarter, and we said we're going to be loaded a little bit heavier to the first half so...","Mark W. Adams","It's tough for us to get too specific, Glen, because timing -- exact timing on acceptance of tools can move, and that can swing that number pretty dramatically quarter-to-quarter even though the same trend line is in place.","Ronald C. Foster","Yes, that's right.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Fair enough. Just with respect to that. The difference between the $1.6 billion and the $1.9 billion, maybe you can just remind us what would lead you to one end or the other end of that range?","Ronald C. Foster","Well, it's a number of variables. One of them is timing, as Mark mentioned, at year-end, right, as how things play through. But it's hard for us to call it much closer than that as we go in the first part of the year.","Mark W. Adams","And, of course, we're always adjusting our proposed product mix and our spend associated with that as we see market condition fall.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. I think on the NAND commentary, you have mentioned that you're watching holiday demand signals to sort of give a census to how you think NAND will progress from here. I know it's a little early for that, but maybe just your initial thoughts on how you see demand trends at the moment from the NAND perspective.","Mark W. Adams","Well, I think quarter-to-date, we feel things are pretty stable. But it's not unusual for some softness and just out of the holiday period, especially given some of the consumer product-driven platforms that NAND consumes or is consuming NAND. So it was only a hedge that we'd like to just kind of follow that on track to make sure that NAND keeps at the current pace.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","[indiscernible]. And one last one [indiscernible].","Mark W. Adams","Sorry, Glen, I\u2019d go a little beyond. I'd say that generally, we're relatively optimistic about the future demand for NAND. We see a lot of growth in end applications that are consuming NAND, including the SSDs that have been alluded to a couple of times already here today. What we don't know about it is what's the macroeconomic environment going to look like. So we're kind of like everyone else here, waiting to find out how that plays out.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it\u2019s not fun to figure it out at this time. Just one last one. I understand why more PC DRAM is more of a supply issue on your part. But just to be clear about what your visibility is on demand from server, is that looking as you expected to look any better, any worse?","Ronald C. Foster","Yes, I think we're, yes, pretty happy with servers. And we think -- kind of line of sight is that it looks pretty stable and growth were into the bit side for sure, and then the units tracking pretty well. So overall, very favorable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","First, just a question on the SSD market, your own sales of SSDs and cash I just wanted to throw that in, you obviously have a lot of momentum there exiting the quarter. On the client and enterprise side, are you looking for some seasonality in Q1 especially on the enterprise ahead some of your new qualifications? And then within that over the next couple of quarters, are there any competitive dynamics we should keep in mind relative to especially the enterprise side that maybe helping or hurting you guys? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Mark W. Adams","I think I mentioned some of our qualification success in my comments and as an indication that we think the -- our enterprise business will grow. Your reference to seasonality, I wasn't quite clear what you're asking. But we don't -- given the earlier stage of enterprise versus the overall SSD business, we can bet that there's growth around it, and we think our business will continue to grow.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","And well, I guess I was referring to like client demand for SSDs in your first quarter, the first calendar quarter actually.","Mark W. Adams","Yes, even in that category, we think it's still pretty high demand. We don't think -- we think it's up and to the right, right now given the lower penetration of [indiscernible] SSDs even in Q1.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","And competitively, do you feel like there's anything going on where you're taking more of an advantage whether it's channel, near term or product category that we should be thinking of?","Mark W. Adams","Well, I think I'll break it out in 2 pieces. On the client side, there certainly had been some client players who had some financial challenges that might impact our ability to actually go out and capture more share. But overall, so the client -- we like our position in client. I think it's very strong. On the enterprise side, it's a little bit more of a design-win engagement model. So when you pick up something, it tends to be pretty large volumes as they roll that out, as your customer rolls it out. But we -- the only thing I would say is that we're pretty pleased. Our NAND team is pretty pleased with the PCIe products that we've come to market with, and that seems to be a high-growth category even within enterprise. So we're pretty bullish on both segments. One is more of a competitive ability to go out and then deliver volume on the client side and to have some differentiated products in our enterprise solution.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And just really quickly, I apologize if I missed this, but in terms of the pricing you're talking about on the NAND side, there were no mix issues that are affecting either the outlook or what we saw on the quarter. I might be unclear on that one.","Ronald C. Foster","No, we would guide you to think that there are always mix issues going on. For example, as Mark just described, we think SSD probably grows for us next quarter. So that's an uplift, for example, over some markets though, every quarter we're dealing with mix-related product movements both in DRAM and NAND.","Mark W. Adams","And if you look at the guidance we gave you in terms of forward NAND pricing for the second quarter, I would say a significant chunk of that is we're looking at mix mainly higher density products going into the channel, for example, and more of our 20-nanometer business related to that higher density. So it is significantly a mix effect. And note the cost per bits is going down correspondingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, you've talked a lot about the server market here. I understand how your bit growth might be strong given some of the move in servers. But there had been a lot of mix indications in terms of infrastructure data center demand. Can you maybe help us parse what's happening to you in terms of bit density growth and maybe what you think the underlying growth rate of that market is right now and how that trends in Q1?","Ronald C. Foster","Alex, I think that the bit growth, we've been pretty confident. We still think that's a pretty good growth platform for us in servers. When you look at overall server unit growth, it's still mid to high single digits. But when you look at the bit growth, I think we're somewhere around 45% or 50% bit growth year-on-year in servers. And so, I think the dynamic I was alluding to earlier is you've got kind of your traditional server players in those type of enterprise applications. And then you've got this cloud data center model where there are people who are actually building out these networks that are actually rolling their own servers or going through ODM models. And so their product requirements because of the way the networks are structured and the requirements of the server aren't the same, that the subsegment of server growth, that is a little bit more commoditized.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. I was wondering if I could ask some other question with regards to PCs right now. With all the transition towards convertibles and tablets, can you give us a sense of maybe what average density per PC is doing right now? And then your assumptions on how some of these moves to more atom-based systems or tablet systems might affect DRAM growth in the PC segment going forward in 2013.","Ronald C. Foster","So I'll take the first part of that, maybe Mark and Mark can jump in on impacts of architecture. But basically in 2012 over 2011 we're going to see PC notebook growth rates around 20% and flat to down units, depending on which third party you're looking at. Next year, third-party data suggest units up probably 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, with bit growth somewhere in the 10% to maybe 12% to 14% range. Obviously, some of that dependent on ASP. But Mark or Mark, would you guys like to talk a little bit how architectures might change content growth?","Mark W. Adams","I think that in one sense, depending on the architecture and the operating system efficiency, that can certainly have a swing factor one way or the other, meaning that the density could go down or up depending on the application focus and the usage model. But in the other side of that is when you get to these type of designs, they tend to be more customized and less commoditized. And so they end up being kind of customer-customer design wins, which can protect us from a little bit of the commodity nature.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well, one last one, if I could. Your CapEx guidance for next year, assuming that does not include Elpida demands, can you maybe bound what you might need to put on top of that in order to keep the Elpida current and then how those assets might even help you going forward in terms of maybe bringing down CapEx spend?","Ronald C. Foster","Alex, we have not released those numbers yet. We will update you when we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shawn Webster of Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Going back to the supply chain disruption, maybe just kind of the explanation was a little bit vague. Is there -- are you able to parse it out between like what was it a supplier of components or other materials or was there a problem in your own factories or something further down the food chain?","Ronald C. Foster","Yes. I don't want to get too specific, Shawn, but it was a -- there were a number of separate events which accumulated to give us the net effect we had, somewhere internal, somewhere at subcons in the back-end.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then on the pricing guidance bound for the current quarter, if we exclude mix or assume stable mix, is pricing still down?","Ronald C. Foster","You can probably -- well, first of all, Shawn, you're going to have to be more specific about what designs. But if you look at the spot market, I think Mark covered this in his comments, pricing generally from the end of our quarter to today is up on a line item by line item basis.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then on the Nanya restructuring still under negotiation, and I understand your -- you don't want to talk a lot about the details yet. But can you tell us what their contribution to your R&D has been in the last couple of quarters, you say?","Mark W. Adams","It's roughly $20 million to $25 million.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then I guess, finally, are you getting any feedback from your PC OEM customers in terms of overall demand outlook for PCs either in Q1 or Q2, or what catalyst could be if server [indiscernible will be a catalyst and maybe what their overall use on PC growth is next year?","Ronald C. Foster","I think the PC growth projection's in line with what Kipp alluded to earlier. I think they, in the traditional desktop\/notebook segment, I think they view the PC growth to be flat plus-or-minus 1% or 2%. But again, I think they -- I think the markets adjust to that. That's already in the market both on the PC OEMs inventory side, as well as the supply side.","Operator","Our question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the manufacturing issues impacting your NAND business in Q1, I know you can't go into a whole lot of detail. But my question is if the disruption is a result in wafer scrappage or was it just a slowdown in output relative to you prior expectations?","Ronald C. Foster","It's a combination of those.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then it also seems like, you may have answered this question, but it also seems like you pushed out bit production cost over -- for your 30-nanometer DRAM ramp by about a quarter. I guess, were you also seeing the same manufacturing challenges as you ramp this process? Or was it a different set of issues relative to your NAND technology? Any color there would be great.","Ronald C. Foster","So we had impacts on DRAM and NAND. I would say that our 30-nanometer technology trajectory and ramp has actually seen dramatic improvements as we move through the quarter. So while it was impact on the DRAM side relative to 30-nanometer output, it was not related to overall the technology ramp. We're very pleased with the way that is going.","Kipp A.

Mark?","D Mark Durcan ","Thanks, Kipp. We had another strong quarter benefiting from continued favorable market conditions and solid execution from the team. We set a new record for quarterly revenue of $4.6 billion. GAAP net income was $1 billion. Free cash flow was $923 million, based on record operating cash flow of $1.6 billion with CapEx of $669 million. ","The investments we are making in the business are putting us in position to continue generating strong cash flow. We expect continued favorable market conditions for 2015 led by constrained supply in DRAM and solid demand for both DRAM and NAND. Demand growth in our business continues to be driven by our customers rapidly increasing memory content to enable them to enhance the performance of their products, as opposed to strictly unit growth of end systems. The resulting demand outlook remains very encouraging. A few good examples of this growth include mobile DRAM, server DRAM and solid state drives all of which are expected to increase memory content per system by 30% to 50% in 2015.","As just mentioned the outlook for DRAM supply remains tight. We continue to expect industry bit growth in the low to mid 20% range in 2015 with the development of advanced process technology proving to be disruptive to wafer production. Our belief is that even with steps taken to address the otherwise declining gross wafer production in DRAM the net wafer output in the industry will stay relatively steady or decline slightly going forward leading to a relative stability of bit supply growth even beyond 2015.","As we have said for some time, compared to DRAM we expect the NAND market to have more volatility although very attractive over the long-term. We are projecting industry supply growth in the high 30% to mid-40% range for 2015 with a significant portion of the range based on deployment of TLC or Triple Level Cell memory. TLC has a compelling cost and price point although there are still some variability in terms of the adoption rate for systems requiring higher performance including certain mobile and SSD applications.","We are often asked about the impact of 3D NAND on the industry supply. We don\u2019t believe 3D NAND will significantly change the current supply growth rate in the industry given the trade-off of more bits per wafer offset by fewer wafers produced per fab and the capital cost associated with either planar conversion or greenfield additions. The key supply variable over the long-term is the extent to which demand and economic returns dictates the need to add incremental 3D capacity. Micron\u2019s approach remains steadfast to focus on returns as opposed to growth or scale when we evaluate this market.","We are entering an interesting year in our business, deploying evolutionary but increasingly challenging process technology in our fabs while also moving more revolutionary technology closer to commercialization. We are very pleased with our recent progress on DRAM. 25-nanometer deployment has been relatively smooth and 20-nanometer enablement is well underway with many milestones being hit early. The extra R&D resources we have brought to bear and the alignment of manufacturing and R&D resources at Hiroshima are clearly bearing fruit. I will come back to how this deployment is impacting our short-term bit growth outlook in a minute.","We also remained very comfortable with the status of our 3D NAND technology development which of course is occurring in collaboration with our JV partner, Intel. 3D NAND enables cost and performance optimization beyond the capabilities of Planar NAND with enhanced product performance across a broad portfolio of applications and significant cost per bit reductions overtime. We commenced early 3D samples in calendar Q4 of 2014 and expect volume commercial production in the second half of calendar year 2015. ","Given the confidence in our technology we recently announced plans to add additional clean room space in Singapore to enable our ramp of 3D NAND as well as other emerging memory technologies. This addition effectively doubles the existing fab 10 clean room space and once completed will create additional economies of scale for our non-volatile memory operations in Singapore.","The CapEx for this project is estimated to be about $4 billion spent over a number of years with tool installs and production expected to begin in calendar \u201816 and calendar \u201817 respectively. We expect to reserve a portion of this capacity for Intel under our supply agreement. Note our fiscal year 2015 CapEx guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion is unchanged as spending this year on new clean room is primarily for design and early construction work.","Our Q2 revenue guidance is $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. Keep in mind we will be moving back to a normal 13 week quarter in Q2 from the 14 week quarter we just completed. In addition to the 13 to 14 week comparison DRAM production is expected to be down sequentially as we prepare fabs for advanced technology deployment including 20-nanometer in subsequent 1x and 1y nodes which we have on our roadmap. These nodes are increasingly challenging which is a good thing in terms of industry supply outlook that can be a short-term headwind in terms of bit shipments. This production will always occur in a normally seasonally slower demand period. ","We continue to focus on product excellence, customer service, margins on returns rather than simply shipping additional bits into the market. To give you an update on our longer term bit growth we now expect our DRAM production to come in below the market for calendar year 2015. There are several factors leading to below market growth this year. These include product disruption for technology upgrades just mentioned, 20-nanometer technology which is being deployed in calendar year \u201815 reduces wafer outs about 15% to 20% for a given square foot of clean room space compared to 30-nanometer. ","Although we are taking steps to minimize the impact our wafers produced will decline year-over-year. By the way I should note we do have cleaning space available to replace or potentially add net DRAM capacity if and when it makes sense from an ROIC standpoint but at this time we are not planning to make that investment. ","Finally, product mix optimization is a factor which continues to grow in importance relative to pure bit metrics. As we diversify and optimize our business ASP per bit, cost per bit and bit growth are all increasingly a function of these decisions. Of course the goal is to provide the most value-added products to our customers within the constrained supply. By way of example this year we are shipping production from DDR-3 to DDR-4 and continue to grow other value-added specialty DRAM products in the mix. ","Turning to bit supply and our NAND business, Q2 is marked by a significant shift in the mix towards the mobile segment. The mobile NAND is characterized by higher ASPs, higher cost per bit and lower bit output per wafer compared to our portfolio average. These mix effects are included in the more detailed guidance Ron and Mark will provide in a minute. This shift in mobile or to mobile is a part of reason our NAND bit growth will also be below the market for calendar year 2015. Of course, we were somewhat above the NAND market growth rate in 2014 following the conversion of our Singapore DRAM fab to NAND. Additionally as I mentioned we will begin manufacturing our 3D NAND in the second half of the year and expect what we believe is industry leading 3D technology to have a significant and positive impact over time.","Before I wrap-up I would like to take a minute to discuss our partnership and supply agreement with Inotera. The supply agreement has a three year term, renewable on an annual basis. As with any agreement dynamics can evolve overtime and changes are sometimes required to ensure fair economics between all the parties. At this point we are in discussion with our partners regarding the terms for renewing the agreement and we will provide an update when appropriate. ","I want to congratulate the team at Micron for a very strong quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity to continue to delivering for our customers and shareholders and we are looking forward to an exciting and productive year in 2015. I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A. ","Ronald C Foster ","Thanks Mark. The first quarter of fiscal 2015 ended on December 4th. We posted to our website a file containing the financial information I will cover, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as guidance for the second quarter.","Our fiscal 2015 contains an extra week, as Mark mentioned, to synchronize our 52 or 53 week fiscal calendar with the August year-end. By policy the extra week falls in our first fiscal quarter. So our first quarter of fiscal 2015 contains 14 weeks while the rest of the quarters will contain the customary 13 weeks. ","The results for the first quarter include net income of $1.003 billion or $0.84 per share on net sales of $4.573 billion. Gross margin came in at 36%, up about three points compared to the previous quarter. Part of this improvement is coming from higher cost in the fourth quarter related to the Tessera license and last time sale of legacy phase change in memory products that we mentioned on our last call.","Our reported income from equity method investments for the first quarter was $124 million substantially all of which is attributable to Inotera. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter was approximately $1.1 billion or $0.97 per share. ","Non-GAAP adjustments resulted in a net increased income of $135 million or $0.13 per share and included the following: The amortization of debt discount and other costs of $38 million includes imputed interest on our convertible notes and the discount on the MMJ installment debt; the loss on restructure of debt of $30 million related to primarily to the repurchase and conversion of convertible notes in the first quarter; the $21 million loss from changes in currency exchange rates particularly for the yen arose from the variances in the forecasted balances of non-USD assets and liabilities that resulted in an over hedged position in the quarter; non-cash tax expense from the MMJ and MMT operations was $38 million. ","Finally, there was 27 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the first quarter of $32.35. ","In the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we expect the following significant non-GAAP adjustments; approximately $35 million for amortization of debt discounts and convertible notes and MMJ installment debt; non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition are expected to be approximately $30 million in the second quarter. Also the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Please refer to the convertible debt dilution table included in the earnings call data file posted on our website.","Let\u2019s turn now to our results by technology and guidance for the second quarter. DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in bit sales volume and stable average selling prices. DRAM gross margin improved a couple of percentage points into the low 40% range. DRAM gross margins for the second quarter using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter should be down slightly compared to the Q1 based on bit production, down high-single to low double digits, ASPs flat to down low-single digits and cost per bit relatively flat. ","The key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the second quarter are continued favorable DRAM market conditions with like-for-like pricing generally stable to down slightly in most DRAM market segments, Mark Adams will expand on this in his comments; lower levels of production primarily due to the normal 13 week period in Q2 and equipment upgrades in preparation for the next generation process technology as Mark Durcan mentioned earlier. ","On the trade NAND side revenue increased 14% in the first quarter with a 20% increase in bit sales volume, partially offset by a 6% decrease in average selling price. Trade NAND gross margin was down slightly to the mid-20% range as cost reductions per bit partially offset decreases in selling prices. Trade NAND gross margins for the second quarter using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter are expected to be down low to mid-single digits compared to Q1 based on bit production flat to down low-single digits with the normal 13 week period in Q2 as I mentioned. ASPs flat to down low-single digits and cost per bit up mid-single digits primarily relating to mix. ","Key trends for the second quarter effecting this guidance are like-for-like pricing is down mid-single digits, pricing pressure in the spot market and with client SSDs early in the quarter although these markets have begun to stabilize of late, and a shift in mix to a higher concentration in mobile and managed NAND products which has a slightly improving effect on margin with increases in both ASP and cost per bit. On a consolidated basis we're guiding total revenue for the second quarter in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion which reflects the normal 13 week period. ","Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, SG&A expense in the second quarter is expected to be relatively stable when compared to Q1, which came in just below our guidance. R&D expense in the first quarter was below our guided range primarily due to improved execution of product qualifications. We expect a higher level of qualification activities in the second quarter which is contemplated in our guidance. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year is estimated at $2.9 billion but will vary based on the changes in the timing of equipment receipts. ","As Mark mentioned the company generated record operating cash flow in the first quarter of $1.6 billion and ended the quarter with $5.3 billion in cash and marketable investments. During the first quarter we spent $532 million on dilution management relating to our convertible notes. We also replaced our $175 million U.S. AR-backed credit line with a $600 million AR and inventory-backed credit line. No amounts have been drawn under either of these facilities. ","During the first quarter we announced Board authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. Any repurchases under the authorization would be performed opportunistically in open trading windows. There were no share repurchases during the first quarter. Expenditures for property plant and equipment in the first quarter were $669 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $3.6 billion and $4 billion. Note that beginning of the first quarter we are combining substantially all payments for property plant and equipment into a single line in the investing section of the statement of cash flows. Historical periods have been reclassified as well to facilitate comparability. ","In prior periods our disclosure of capital expenditures was the sum of expenditures of property plant equipment and payments on equipment contracts. So there is no change in the disclosure of total capital expenditures just a landscape change on the cash flow statement. We estimate that for every one Yen change in the U.S. dollar-yen exchange rate our cash expenses in Japan changed approximately $2.5 million. Our Q2 guidance contemplates the U.S. dollar to yen exchange rate at the end of Q1, which was approximately 120 yen to the dollar. As a reference the average exchange rate during the first quarter was approximately 110.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. ","Mark Adams","Thanks, Ron. I will cover a review of our Q1 operating performance as well as share commentary on market insights, key segment trends and memory industry dynamics as we enter calendar 2015. ","Our Computing and Networking Business Unit, referred to as CNBU had an outstanding quarter recording $2.1 billion in revenues. Our operating margins came in at 30% compared to 26% in Q4. CNBU benefited from a slightly higher DRAM prices and lower cost has led to overall [ph] improved operating performance in the quarter. The growing diversification of our end market is reflected in a favorable mix across our computing, server, networking, enterprise and graphic segments. ","Demand in the PC-client segment remained strong in our first quarter. These shipments in client grew heading into the holidays and pricing held firm in Q1. We commenced volume shipments of our 25 nanometer technology into the client PC tier 1 OEM customer base which resulted in improved cost. Driven by continued growth in cloud computing and data analytics we achieved both record revenue and bit shipments in our sever business. ","Server DRAM bit growth is forecasted to grow 40% year-on-year. The growth in server-based memory is based on increasing server workloads that require higher DRAM performance and density. Our server business remains a very attractive segment with a demand profile that is less sensitive to price fluctuations in the market.","The Networking segment delivered revenue growth of up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Demand remained strong driven by LTE build out in China and other emerging markets. We are optimistic that bandwidth requirements from increased data, audio video and gaming content projected to grow roughly 20% in calendar year 2015 will drive higher demand from Micron's memory products in a business that yields attractive gross margins. ","Our Graphics business which is another market segment that delivers favorable ASP and margin uplift grew Q1 revenues 18% when compared to fiscal year Q1, 2014. Last year consoles doubled their memory content per box and we feel that there will be a digital content growth this year as the use of these devices continues to expand beyond gaming into more compute and home entertainment functions. ","We had a strong quarter in DRAM technology enablement. We are pleased with the team's execution on DDR4 as major OEMs are in qualification for their value added configurations. While coming off a relatively low base shipments of DDR4 increased four times quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing very strong demand signals for DDR4 in the coming quarters, in particular from the enterprise server customer base.","DDR4 ASPs remain at a significant premium to DDR3 given the enhanced performance. As the market for DDR4 begins to take shape over the next 12 months and beyond the rate of growth should positively impact our average ASP. We're seeing good progress of our eight gigabit GDDR5 technology as we're shipping engineering samples to two of our larger enabling partners. ","And finally the research and development team saw fantastic progress in the enablement of our 20 nanometer technology DRAM process. We are evaluating ways to accelerate this transition ahead of our current plan. ","Our Storage Business Unit or SBU achieved $987 million in revenue in Q1, up 9% quarter-on-quarter. Our SBU operating margins were stable this quarter despite some challenging pricing dynamics. It appears there has been some additional TLC capacity, in both the channel components and client SSD segments which applied downward pressure on pricing towards the end of our first quarter and into our current quarter. ","As we produce primarily MLC technology we are focused on finding higher value opportunities that require best-in-class performance and are trying to minimize our exposure through aggressive market pricing. We are making good progress in driving our SSD roadmap to our award winning 16-nanometer technology. We successfully qualified the M600 drive at a tier-1 PC OEM customer and anticipate additional commitments over the next 90 days. In addition today we are announcing two crucial branded client-SSDs enabled by Micron\u2019s 16-nanometer process for shipment in this quarter. We expect to have 50% of our client-SSD shipments on 16-nanometer by the end of our first quarter. ","On our last call I outlined the steps we were taking to improve our overall NAND competitiveness. I wanted to give you an update on our progress. Our focus is in three areas; process advancement, system level enablement and higher value end market applications. We successfully hit the forecasted milestone to deliver engineering samples of our 60 nanometer TLC device by the end of calendar 2014. We are targeting late spring shipments of TLC components to the channel and consumer segments and expect to commence shipping at TLC client-SSD drive into the market during the second half of 2015. ","Micron will continue to increase our leadership in overall NAND scaling demonstrated by our vertical cell 256 gigabit MLC and 384 gigabit TLC 3D NAND devices, which we believe will have the highest density per square inch of silicon in the industry. We are now sampling our 3D NAND component and remain on track for initial commercial production during the second half of calendar 2015. ","Beyond innovation at the technology level we continue to add controller and firmware resources that are helping to accelerate product development and enhance the quality of our enterprise datacenter and client-based SSD products. In addition we are investing in packaging capabilities that allow us to integrate technologies to offer performance, power and\/or reliability benefits. Such capabilities are the foundation for driving into more solution-oriented products designed to meet specific customer needs. ","Finally we are continuing to diversify our NAND business into more attractive end market applications. As an example revenue for NAND sold into the mobile segment was up over 45% quarter-over-quarter. Coupling NAND with DRAM in the form of eMCPs is a high growth opportunity which I will discuss in the Mobile segment shortly. ","Our Enterprise SSD business set a revenue record in Q1 and margins were up quarter-over-quarter as the team drove qualifications of our M500DC product into cloud and datacenter customers. We are evaluating options to accelerate growth into this expanding segment of the market that includes datacenter, cloud, networking, security search and e-commerce customers. The fundamental for long-term growth drivers, such as client enterprise storage, mobile storage and embedded applications driving the NAND consumptions continues to be positive. We are meeting the milestones we set in our plan to improve the long-term operating competitiveness and feel optimistic about our position going forward. ","The Mobile Business Unit or MBU had another outstanding quarter. MBU revenue came in at $940 million. Operating margins were 32% in Q1 compared with 22% in our last quarter. We continue to see strong demand in mobile. The iPhone 6 launch was a catalyst for strong holiday demand. Memory content per devices driving customer forecast in 2015. On the high end the Samsung Note is shipping with 3 gigabytes of low powered DRAM and Chinese competitors such as Xiaomi are differentiating with larger memory configurations. ","The low to mid-range priced smartphone market is driving additional memory content as well and even the future phone segment is evolving from phones with virtually no DRAM to new products such as the Android 1 which has 1 gigabyte of low powered DRAM. We are also seeing higher memory content in Flash where mid and high end smartphones have shifted configurations from 32 gigabytes and 64 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes and 128 gigabytes.","On the product front we are growing our managed NAND business with increased shipments of the eMCPs. The rapid adoption of the eMCPs by the mid-range market where there is strong growth has created significant opportunity for Micron. With our capability of supplying known good die flow from the former Elpida operations and our 16-nanometer NAND technology Micron is uniquely positioned to capture this growth opportunity as eMCPs move to replace eMMC in the largest mobile segments.","The team is also working on low power DDR4 enablement with our chipset partners that will allow for key customer differentiator in the future. As Mark and I\u2019ve said in prior communications we are focused on a returns approach to the mobile business. We are pleased with the progress the team has made to-date. We are constrained to meet our customer demand forecast and continue to evaluate how to best balance our overall capacity to support Micron\u2019s valued customers.","Our Embedded Business or EBU set a quarterly revenue record achieving $539 million in sales. This is our 8th consecutive quarter of revenue growth for EBU. Our operating margins rose to 22%, up from 16% last quarter. This growth was driven by record shipments to the automotive and industrial and multi market segments. Automotive revenues were up 18% quarter-on-quarter. The automotive segment continues to benefit from memory content fueled by both infotainment and advanced driver assistant systems in the new offerings. Our commitment to the unique needs of this market in areas such as quality, reliability, product longevity and service have enabled us to strengthen our market leadership in Q1.","The broad category of industrial and multi market was up 12% quarter-on-quarter driven by continued growth in factory automation, machine-to-machine and aerospace and defense. As we see strong demand growth in areas such as automotive entertainment consumer electronics, connected smart homes and machine-to-machine systems we remain optimistic for a strong demand environment in our EBU business for fiscal year 2015.","It is worthy of note that we have recorded our fourth consecutive quarter of growth in NOR product shipments with over 470% now on our 45-nanometer process. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our portfolio of DRAM, NAND and NOR to drive continued growth and profits in the embedded market.","Coming off a strong fiscal year \u201814 our operations team is focused on managing through a number of transitions to ensure long-term competitiveness. On the integration front we implemented Micron\u2019s manufacturing information systems in our fabs in both Hiroshima and Taiwan in Q1. We are also driving expanded 25-nanometer technology at MMJ and MMT. In conjunction with our R&D organization MMJ is preparing for a second half calendar year \u201815 conversion to 20-nanometer which looks very promising with a focus on polling end of day [ph] for volume production.","In preparation for these technology transitions we will see lower DRAM bit production in Q2 which will result in small production down side already contemplated in the forecast that both Mark and Ron messaged in their comments. The team is also busy preparing our plan for the recently announced fab expansion in Singapore which we feel offers us the flexibility to efficiently expand the 3D and emerging memory production in the future as the market conditions warrant. Finally in the backend of our business we signed a strategic agreement to partner with PTI to provide a local assembly services on our Xi'an campus which will both lower cost and overall cycle time. ","I would like to now briefly discuss what we are currently seeing in the market post holidays. Pricing environment for our portfolio of DRAM products remains favorable overall. We have seen modest pricing pressure in the PC segment which is not surprising due to seasonality. Mobile DRAM pricing remains relatively stable as we remain very tight on supply in Q2. On the NAND front pricing saw some softness during the last month of Q1 and the first month of Q2. That being said we are seeing some signs of improved price in NAND of late including tightened of supply in certain segments such as low density consumer NAND. Our sense is that client SSD inventory at Tier 1 OEM is still somewhat high post-Christmas. ","We also saw increasing TLC supply from what had believed to be one of our competitors, shifting NAND production away from their own internal mobile consumption to the channel and client SSD business. Despite these short term pressures, which could potentially cause short term margin compression we feel these effects are temporary and remain bullish on the longer term outlook for NAND and we feel we are taking the right steps to optimize our business over the long run. As the industry converts to 3D NAND we feel our performance and cost will continue to improve, driving accelerated adoption in NAND in the client, mobile and enterprise market segments. ","In closing, I too want to congratulate our team on another great quarter. We are excited about the enablement of a number of the technology advancements I referenced to my comments and feel we are well positioned for continued success in a diversifying memory business. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp. ","Kipp A Bedard ","Thanks Mark and we will now take questions from callers. Karen, would you please open the lines at this time. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first quarter comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest. ","Monika Garg ","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question on the NAND market. If you look at your cost decline and ASP assumptions, the NAND margins are going down again in the quarter. So the question is why not to delay the conversion to 3D NAND and so that there is a lower bit growth in the market and let the market become even stronger before kind of adding more bits to the market?","D Mark Durcan ","Monika, first of all I would point out that the NAND market to us is really long-term very, very attractive. We see a lot of growth there and we think it\u2019s worth investing in. Having said that we believe that 3D is a key enabler to future leading edge products and frankly to long-term success in the business. And therefore as we look at our business we're prepared to invest in it. We haven't said a whole lot about what the rate of our ramp would be or exact timing as to when we would bring on additional supply but we do believe it's important to getting moving down the path and introducing our 3D products into the marketplace and enabling those end applications to use our products. ","Having said all of that, I think we\u2019ve tried to be pretty clear that there is a discipline in our approach, that we're going to look at the market on an ongoing basis and make sure that we don't disrupt supply and that we think 3D is not something that is likely to be some sort of step function sea change in terms of how Micron or other competitors in the marketplace manage their production and that's because there are trade-offs here. As you point out there is capital investment required, there is clean space and it's not -- while it's enabling and important it's not a massive disruption that we believe will create the oversupply you are alluding to. ","Monika Garg ","Thanks. Just to follow up on the Inotera, could you provide any color on when could we expect the kind of the new -- I guess if you negotiate that agreement with of Inotera, when can we see the impact on the financials. Thanks. ","D Mark Durcan ","I don't think that there is a lot we can add to what we've already said relatively to Inotera. It's a three year agreement, as we said before; it's renewable on an annual basis. We value the relationship, we think the other parties value the relationship when we think that, that sets a foundation for a reasonable discussion to lead to a long-term beneficial outcome for all parties. ","But trying to discuss in advance when and what that might look like I don\u2019t think is particularly productive. ","Monika Garg ","Thank you so much. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of -- excuse me, Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. ","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, thanks for taking my question. I have two. On DRAM can you please help me understand the mix between consumer PC, server and mobile and how this mix changed from November into the February quarter? And then on the NAND, it's great to give us an update on the milestones, but I'm still little bit confused what the strategy is. Are you trying to be everything to everyone or are you trying to be more focused on a specific segment of NAND that you are pursuing? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you. ","Mark Adams","So I will start with the first question. As it relates to the share in the DRAM segment, it\u2019s best to think of our PC business, the PC DRAM business somewhere in the mid-30% share wise and our mobile DRAM business somewhere in the mid-20% and servers, roughly high-teens. And directionally while these things are really tough to shift in one quarter you see a mild uptick as we start to shift some more capacity over to server in Q1. Mobile was roughly flat and the server business was like in the client business, PC business was maybe down a little bit but that\u2019s roughly how it shifted in the relative size of the share and DRAM.","D Mark Durcan ","And Mehdi, this is Mark Durcan. Maybe I will take the NAND piece of that question. At a high level what we said is we want to play in a lot of different application segments for NAND and we acknowledge that takes a lot of resources and then getting the balance of those resources right requires ongoing work and when you do a better job over the next couple of years then we have done over the last couple of years, relative to how we allocate those resources. ","Having said that, we talked in our commentary, we feel like it\u2019s important for us to be in the mobile NAND segment. We think we have a lot of synergy with our low power DRAM business there and with our customers. We think there is a lot of value added things we can do for them in the mobile segment. We can\u2019t ignore what is a very large and fast growing segment in the market, which is the client SSD piece and we clearly want to be in the enterprise because over the long haul we are going to drive significant value there. So we will continue to put our resources across a number of different applications segment and then allocate our capacity as we see our progress in all of those different segments.","Mehdi Hosseini","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. When I look at your guidance it assumes a little bit of challenging environment for you in terms of cost declines. Can you maybe walk us through what is happening at Inotera with the -- migration and what, if any impact that will have on the DRAM cost per bit?","Mark Adams","Yes, maybe I will take that. You know as I mentioned, mix is an increasingly important piece of the answer in all these questions because as we move to more value added applications that\u2019s going to drive different bit growth, think about DDR3 to DDR4 there is 10% to 15% die sizes [ph] that are moving to that technology depending on exactly how you are positioned. That\u2019s going to mitigate bit growth in the year but it\u2019s going to probably drive value. The customers certainly see a lot of value in getting a DDR4 today. ","Likewise as we move to more differentiated products to service networking and higher performance computing and move more of our men in that direction we won\u2019t see the clients we have seen in the past but hopefully we will see value add commence by the customer. You know beyond that I would say there is not a lot structurally that would change here other than you should recognize that Micron today is deploying capital to support a 20 nanometer ramp that is a large productivity step. And any time you deploy capital you don\u2019t get a return spontaneously. It takes a while for that capital equipment to installed and productive and for the load line to be loaded and moved to inventory out in the marketplace. And so you have to contemplate that a little bit as 2015 is an exciting year for us in terms of technology deployments. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research.","Steven Fox","Thanks, good afternoon. Two questions from me, just to dig in a little bit more on the client SSD market; how much -- can you just sort of go into some color as to how much of the competiveness you are seeing is temporary and then from a Micron standpoint how much gets kind of fixed as you roll out your TLC product or is there other things that you can do to improve margins there? ","And then secondly, if you can sort of give us a little bit more of a color around the DDR4 timing of the ramp and how that's going to affect your mix and margins because I guess I was on the impression maybe we're going to start to see more in the quarter we're in now. Thanks. ","Mark Adams","So, on the SSD side, we started to see kind of pre-holiday inventory build at the key customers and we truly do believe it's a temporary piece of the market dynamics in NAND. What we have been saying, as I said over the last week or so is that the NAND price actually stabilized a bit in some sense and some segments has gone up. So relative to the question on TLC competitiveness, as we bring those products to market as I mentioned in my comments early in the second half of calendar year '15 we do expect to be able to compete more favorably and will then be able to drive more of our mix to the TLC SSD client products. ","At this point as we look at our opportunities there, we're just being careful not to try to compete with lower cost products when we can take these MLC products and trying to pursue better or higher value homes.","On the DDR ramp, as I said earlier we're pleased with the ramp, although it still early and we think it's reasonable to see by the end of our fiscal year somewhat in the area of 30% plus or minus of our server bits will be DDR4 and really will let the market dictate what that looks like as far as the ramp and scaling it up.","Steven Fox","Thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. ","John Pitzer","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is just kind of a follow up on the bit production for DRAM. Can you quantify how much slower than the market do you expect to grow this year and I guess importantly given the timing of product transitions, technology transitions would you expect big growth to resume sequentially from the February to the May quarter. ","D Mark Durcan ","Let me take the last bit of that John then maybe Mark can take the first part, Mark Adams take the first part. I think we will see as we move out in time, a get back to sort of a more normal bit growth rate quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned just a minute ago when you deploy technology sometimes there is disruptions in manufacturing. In particular you want to make sure you're facilitating all the equipment to have legs out in the time and then as you deploy that technology you don't necessarily get the bits and the output immediately. ","So yes, we would anticipate being back on a more normal trajectory further out in the year. ","Kipp A Bedard","And John would you repeat the first half of your question for Mark please. ","John Pitzer","By how much do you think you'll under grow DRAM bit growth this year? You said you'd under grow industry?","Mark Adams ","Well, we never held a whole lot of position in that but it kind of depends on the mix of DDR4 we put out into the marketplace and exactly how we progress with some of these specialty products I was talking about. We said sort of for the market in the low to mid 20's and we think we'll probably be 20% plus or minus, a little bit lower.","John Pitzer","And then guys on the NAND profitability side, you guys have been working hard over the last 12 months to improve that. One of the arguments was that you were just selling bits into the wrong market and as mix improved you would start to see the margin benefit. You are starting to see that mix improvement, it sounds like in your prepared comments that the move to mobile is accretive but not a big enough move in mix yet to actually drive gross margins higher. Can you help me understand where the mix of mobile in NAND is today and given where you think that mix is going to go, are you confident thinking that February might be the gross margin trough for the NAND?","D Mark Durcan ","Let me take the first part of that. I think the first part of your statement was right. We are unhappy with the progress. There is not enough of that yet to be really moving the needle in the overall scheme of things. I would comment that the NAND business generally has been a little tougher for our competitors as well over the last number of quarters. The relative improvement is better than the absolute improvement so to speak when you look at it. And we continue to put the pieces together for the longer term and we think we're making progress doing that. ","Mark Adams","And I can just make comment on the front part where you talked about the product mix, John. And mind you these things are not necessarily things that shift dramatically in a quarter, but to your point you will see mobile as a percent of our overall NAND business just quarter-over-quarter almost double in terms of the share of the business, up to close to 20, almost slightly 20% slightly below 20% of our NAND business. And then you will see a healthy shift away from our products and component business as we do this and find better homes and we'll continue to look at ways to drive enterprise storage in client SSDs for markets that make sense. ","Mark made an interesting comment in his prepared statement today that we are finding customers that are not totally invested in TLC for their client-SSDs where they're finding higher performance requirements or just simply reliability issues that they don't want to bet on in TLC. And so we're going to continue to drive our customers to evaluate our higher performing MLC based client SSD storage as we drive that forward as well. And so that should be the trend you see mobile, a shift away from channel and driving more enterprise and high performance client SSD. ","John Pitzer","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman from Bernstein.","Mark Newman","Hi, yeah, thanks for taking my question. The results on DRAM continue to do very, very well, continue to be more stronger than expected actually. When I think if I could summarize what you're saying, we think that the markets are going to be strong and that's going to continue throughout 2015. But looking at NAND, obviously continues to disappoint I think with gross margins down and looks like you're projecting down again next quarter. So the question really I have for you and some of that you've already talked about but I want to ask more specifically, do you think this is -- this somewhat disappointment on the NAND side I would say or delay in the recovery it seems to be, is it related to the market being worse than expected due to oversupply in the market or is it difficulties on execution?","And what kind a timing should we expect for improvement on the NAND side. It seems like the NAND recovery or it seems to be about two quarters off in obviously TLC, SSDs or both have been mentioned as a big part of that solution. Now it seems like you're moving some of your mix to mobile. So I'd like to understand what the updated plan really is to improve the profitability of the NAND. Thanks. ","Mark Adams","Good, Mark, hey Mark this is Mark Adams, thanks for the question. Couple of things, if you look back over the last couple of quarters on a relative basis, our margins have held pretty stable relative to our competition, actually closing -- incrementally closing the gap a little bit. Now we're not satisfied with that by any stretch but actually those are different data points. This quarter, again gross margin was pretty flat in a relatively tough period for NAND in the market dynamics. So as a backdrop to your question that's what we're up against. ","When you talked about kind of a confusing our change in strategy, I don't think that's the case. Please don't mix TLC with where the end application products go. You mentioned TLC and now a shift to mobile. Actually mobile enterprise and client SSDs were always part of our strategy and continue to be part of our strategy. TLC is the technology foundation for what we enable low cost solutions in the market and we invest in that. ","Over the last year, both Mark and myself have made comments to the tune of sampling at the end of the calendar year. That's in place. We've done that. We're in process and starting qualifications. We said components and consumer applications would be shipping late spring, end of the calendar second quarter and we'll be launching client-based SSDs drives of TLC. Those are all tactics to the strategy of deploying TLC where it makes sense in the market. That's not the whole story. ","Using our DRAM and NAND technology and knowing it could flow from either Elpida combined with our technology in MLC and eventually TLC we're going to launch and develop the mobile market. We're going to continue investing in controllers and firmware and software technology, to advance both enterprise and client SSDs. We don\u2019t see TLC in the enterprise just yet. We will continue to evaluate that path but that\u2019s an end market that has nothing to do with TLC or MLC. ","On the client side same thing, we are going to still make client MLC drives but in markets that are looking for lower cost alternatives and willing to sacrifice in performance we will deploy TLC. So those areas of mobile and enterprise and client storage are three pillars of where we are investing to drive applications and the technology, whether it be MLC or TLC is the core to how we get there.","Mark Newman","Got it, that\u2019s very, very helpful. Which area do you think is more -- how would you order the margins for Micron amongst the businesses in NAND out of client SSD, enterprise SSD, mobile and everything else, how would you order those?","Mark Adams","I think the best way to look at it is enterprise SSDs are likely to garner the highest margins, mobile would probably be second and client SSDs third of those three and then there is still healthy in terms of volume, is a components channel out there for consumer applications and embedded application so on and so forth. So that can vary depending on the overall market dynamics.","Mark Newman","I see. And then looking forward to later on this year, do we expect that the market is going to become healthier in NAND flash? Do we need to see a healthier market in NAND for margins to get back up significantly higher than this, do you think?","Mark Adams","Well as we as it\u2019s always tough to project, I would say I want to caution you. The gut feel right now based on the feedback from our customers is that NAND is going to be relatively tight now. When we talk about this changing business we are in it doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t have small period, temporary periods where there is an oversupply in certain segment of the market whether it be a client SSD issue, whether it be something else and so we think overall with the growth in demand drivers in mobile, enterprise and client that overall we think it\u2019s going to be in pretty shape and the type of demand forecast we are seeing from our customers suggest that things will remain in balance and be pretty positive in the remainder of our fiscal year.","Mark Newman","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much.","Kipp A Bedard","Thank you Mark. and Karen I think we have time for one more caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Daniel Amir from Ladenburg.","Daniel L. Amir","Thanks a lot, thank you for taking my call. So I was wondering here what is basically changed, maybe from your perspective in the past 90 days, is this more the DRAM business, more the NAND business because it certainly looked like that 90 days ago there was a more of a thought here that the NAND business might be in a change, demand remains pretty solid for DRAM but now you are looking at maybe lower bit growth here. So has something surprised you on the negative side or was this kind of a thought process 90 days ago of the business? Thanks.","D Mark Durcan ","Sure, thanks for the question, the way I would answer that is that we don\u2019t see any structural change in the business. On the NAND side we do believe there were some shifting of some capacity from competitors into -- away from certain segments and into the kind of low volume segment that hit pricing a little bit on the spot market and in the client entry level client devices and what have you but we don\u2019t see any structure there we think actually we are very bullish still on the NAND demand side of the business. And in the DRAM piece I think Mark spoke to rationale behind what drove our decisions to making the DRAM capacity long-term decisions in investments. So we still think it\u2019s very good business very stable and ASPs are relatively flat and we are still pretty positive.","Daniel L. Amir","All right great, thanks.","Kipp A Bedard ","Thank you, Daniel. And with that we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

For fiscal Q2 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $4.65 billion with non-GAAP gross margin of 38.5% and net income of $1.03 billion or $0.90 per share. Revenue was at the top of our guidance while gross margin, operating income and earnings per share exceeded projections. Operating cash flow was $1.8 billion.","Last quarter, we provided detailed insight on industry pricing dynamics, explaining how the significant increases over trough pricing for PC DRAM far exceeded what we had seen in other segments which typically react more slowly. This quarter, we saw continued gains in client DRAM pricing but also benefited from increases in mobile, cloud and enterprise pricing as well. All of these segments showed meaningful quarter-over quarter increases. These gains, combined with outstanding progress on cost reductions, led to a significant increase in our DRAM margins.","In NAND, we were able to capitalize on an increasing percentage of low-cost 3D TLC NAND by more fully participating in the SSD market. As a result, while blended ASPs were down slightly due to a higher density product mix, our NAND margins improved substantially over last quarter.","As we noted in our February analyst conference, we continue to see broad industry trends placing increasing value on the memory and storage technologies we develop and the features those product -- those technologies can provide. In the most recent quarter, you can see that reflected in significant increases in cloud and enterprise businesses, both in bits shipped and value of products going to those segments and in an ongoing preference for SSDs over HDDs in storage platforms. We'll comment more on this when we walk through the specific business details in a moment.","From a supply and demand perspective, we continue to be comfortable with market dynamics given the capacity plans we're aware of today.","I'll now provide a high-level overview of each of the business units and Ernie will follow on with more details on our financial performance.","In the compute and networking business unit, we experienced continued revenue growth as a result of strength across all market segments with particular strength in cloud and enterprise. We began enablement of our 1X nanometer products and extended our lead in graphics technology with the announcement of our next generation GDDR5X product which is the fastest discrete memory available.","In our mobile business, as in other segments, broad market tightness has resulted in increased ASPs across all types of mobile memory. Our customers continue to be focused on increased memory and storage density for smartphones which nicely plays to Micron strategy to focus on MCP markets. We plan to introduce more than 20 new MCP designs over the next 12 months to address the highest growth mobile applications. Customers prefer these solutions because they simplify design, validation and supply chain processes. MCPs also provide Micron with an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with key market enablers, providing a path to increased market share.","Our embedded business grew revenues this quarter through increased DRAM shipments in automotive as well as consumer and connected home applications and we achieved record automotive revenues for the fourth quarter in a row. Increased NAND shipments to industrial multi-market customers helped offset this quarter's anticipated decline in NOR shipments to Japanese gaming applications.","Design and activity continues to be strong for our 20 nanometer DDR and LP DDR products in automotive, consumer, connected home and Internet of Things gateway applications. In addition, design-in activity for our latest generation of automotive grade managed NAND continues to increase with new design wins up significantly over the prior quarter.","Our storage business performance this quarter was driven by continued shift to cost-effective 3D NAND TLC products and increased traction for our SSD portfolio across the OEM cloud and enterprise markets. Wins with OEM customers enabled a record number of SSD shipments during the quarter.","Customer focus on larger capacity and tailored storage solutions led to a dramatic growth in our enterprise and cloud segments which were our fastest-growing part of our SSD portfolio. The trend toward tailored solution drives greater opportunities for Micron to engage end customers on future IT investment planning. As we pursue these opportunities, our flexible, feature-oriented portfolio has been well received by our customers.","The storage market has broadly adopted 3D TLC products and we're well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. We're seeing the ongoing demand for high-performance, reliable, power efficient storage driving greater SSD adoption across multiple markets. We anticipate to grow our overall storage bit output as our Fab 10X expansion continues to ramp.","Our technology transitions are on track and will continue to provide benefit to the Company over the next several quarters. We're driving deployment of 1X DRAM with meaningful output expected by the end of the fiscal year. We expect 1X nanometer DRAM to build on our success with 20 nanometer DRAM which is deployed throughout our portfolio and rated number one in quality by multiple enterprise OEM customers.","Likewise, we're aggressively proliferating 32 layer 3D NAND through our product lines while also driving the deployment of 64 layer 3D NAND with meaningful output expected by the end of the fiscal year. Micron's unique integration of CMOS circuitry under the array will enable the industry's smallest die size on our 64 layer designs.","As we look toward the end of our fiscal year, we're currently on track to have more than 75% of our NAND bits on 3D. Of course, certain segments require legacy NAND technologies and will transition much more slowly, embedded markets for example.","As we previewed for you at our analyst day, we believe our NAND bit growth in fiscal 2018 will approximate the aggregate market growth. This will take 3D NAND to 90% of our total bit output for fiscal 2018. We continue to work on developing new memory technologies and are enabling our 3D XPoint technology. We will be shipping 3D XPoint memory for revenue later in 2017. We believe these innovative solutions offer unique value to enterprise customers and will be an important contributor to Micron's future success.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ernie.","Ernie Maddock","Thank you Mark. The business environments in fiscal Q2 continued to be positive with our results favorably impacted by product mix, progress on our cost improvement and the sustained positive pricing environment. I'll begin my remarks today with an overview of the fiscal Q2 results by technology and business unit followed by our corporate financial performance and guidance for fiscal Q3.","DRAM represented 64% of our total revenue with the following segmentation, mobile was in the high 20% range; PC represented 25%; server also represented 25%, up from the high teens of the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 20% range.","In our nonvolatile memory business, trade NAND represented 30% of our revenue with the following segmentation, consumer which includes memory cards, U.S.B and components, represented approximately 40%; mobile represented 20%; and as a reminder, EMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-20% range, up from the mid-teens percent last quarter. And the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range.","Turning to performance by business unit, the compute and networking business units reported fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.92 billion, up 30% sequentially due to firm demand in a robust pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $736 million or 36% of revenue, up from 14% the prior quarter, enhanced by the pricing environment and better performance on costs.","We saw good growth in the cloud and enterprise segments driven by shipments of our first generation 20 nanometer DDR4 products. Additionally, we're beginning shipments of our second generation product optimized for the industry's newest service -- server platform. Graphics saw modest revenue growth despite what is traditionally a seasonally weak period and we began shipments of our next generation G5X to Nvidia for the new GeForce 1080Ti, further solidifying Micron's technology leadership in the high-performance graphics memory segment.","Networking saw increased shipments and revenue driven by the continued growth ","of 20 nanometer 4 gigabit DDR3 and 8 gigabit DDR4 products at key OEMs, especially in Asia and client revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued strong pricing environment.","The mobile business unit delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.08 billion, up 5% sequentially, driven by a stronger pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $170 million or 16% of revenue, as pricing strength combined with improved costs.","The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $590 million, up 2% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $193 million or 33% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by increased automotive unit shipments and increased average selling prices of DDR3 and NAND on a like-for-like basis in our consumer and connected home segments.","The storage business delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.04 billion, up 21% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $71 million or 7% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by strong growth in client and cloud SSD shipments and lower costs. Our 5100 cloud drive which was introduced in December, continues to be well received and is in the process of additional calls on a large number of customer platforms.","Moving on to overall Company results, revenue for the fiscal second quarter was $4.65 billion, up 17% sequentially and driven primarily by DRAM pricing strength and increased NAND volume shipments in a stable to rising pricing environment.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 38.5%, up from 26% in the prior quarter, driven by product mix, cost reductions and the strong pricing environment. Non-GAAP net income was $1.03 billion or $0.90 per share.","Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 22% compared to the prior quarter as the result of a 1% increase in bit shipments and a 21% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the second quarter increased 16 percentage points sequentially to 44% driven primarily by the strong pricing environment and cost declines. As we look at the next couple of quarters, we expect that second-half fiscal year 2017 bits out will exceed first-half fiscal year 2017 bits out by about 10%.","Our nonvolatile trade revenue, NAND revenue, increased 11% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an 18% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were down 6% from the prior quarter on a blended basis, primarily as a result of a higher density product mix. Gross margin increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 31% as cost per bit was down 15%. We're seeing like-for-like price increases across nearly all segments and, looking forward, we expect that second-half fiscal year 2017 bits out will exceed first-half fiscal year 2017 bits out by about 30%, occurring primarily in FQ3. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $612 million, at the midpoint of the guidance range.","The Company generated operating cash flow of $1.77 billion, representing an increase of $628 million over last quarter. To conform to GAAP reporting relative to the Inotera acquisition, we reflected approximately $350 million of the Inotera purchase price as a reduction to operating cash flows. As a result, our financial statements reflect operating cash flow of $1.41 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $4.6 billion. In the second fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.2 billion.","Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following, revenue in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion; gross margin in the range of 44% to 48%; operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million; operating income ranging between $1.8 billion and $2 billion; and EPS ranging between $1.43 and $1.57 per share based on 1.155 billion diluted shares.","In closing, we remain focused on achieving the technology transition and cost reduction targets we outlined at our analyst day. Currently, we're tracking to deliver free cash flow in excess of the $1.5 billion we shared with you at that event and continue to view delevering as an important priority.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Durcan","Thanks Ernie. In summary, we're heading into the third quarter with a strong market environment and steady progress on our technology initiatives. I'm preleased with our execution and we continue to press forward together on technology, operational and product enablement targets. Our continued progress towards these goals will enable us -- will enable further cost reductions and the opportunity to address higher value-added market segments.","Looking to the market as a whole, we see increasing customer interest in Micron playing a more collaborative role in solving design challenges and plan to use this environment to strengthen our relationships with industry partners and customers.","As you all know, at our analyst conference in February, I announced my retirement. While the board and I work to identify my successor, I remain fully committed and engaged in leading Micron through this exciting and dynamic period. We will provide further updates on our CEO search as appropriate.","Operator, we're now ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your question please. ","Harlan Sur","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution and strong outlook. Despite the very optimistic and positive pricing environment, there's been some growing concern around the notion of demand destruction given the strong pricing environment and availability of both DRAM and NAND to a point where I think there is a view forming that there's potential for PC and server destocking on the DRAM side, less DRAM per box, on the mobile side, less DRAM per smartphone and on the NAND side, less uptake of SSDs and more uptake of HDDs. I guess the question is do you see this happening and how does it impact the dynamics of the supply-demand environment going forward?","Mark Durcan","This is Mark. To date, we've seen no indication of that at all really in any segment. It's true that, in cycles, from time to time, that does happen late in a cycle, but, today, we see continued strong bit growth across almost every end market segment and no real indication of that occurring anywhere, in particular not in specialty, not in mobile, certainly not in the enterprise and server area.","Harlan Sur","Great, thank you for that. And then solid results in the NAND business with your margins up I think it's 800 basis points in the quarter. As we think about the cost curve on a go-forward basis and the ramp of your 64 layer 3D, can you just give us an idea on how your yields and performance of the products are doing either relative to your internal targets or relative to the same time last year in the ramp of your 32 layer products?","Mark Durcan","This is Mark. A year ago, Harlan, I can't catch that I even recall where we were on 3D NAND yields, but I will tell you we're very happy with where they are for 32 layer MLC and TLC. And again, TLC is the big piece of that. We're where we thought we ought to be and at very mature yields. 64 layer, as we talked about, is a material piece of our bid output late in the year and we're very happy with the progress we're making there and the yields we're seeing on that technology as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your question please.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. First of all, if you could talk a little bit more color around this -- I believe you talked about bit growth of about 30% half-over-half. Maybe qualify or quantify as much as you want to the growth drivers, how much from SSDs versus mobile, etc.","And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the auto growth in the quarter and what's driving that and how that looks into the second half as well and what's the key contributors there? Thank you.","Mark Durcan","Sure. So relative to bit growth with NAND, that was more statement around what our output profile is going to look like. And of course, we will deploy that output to the end markets that we feel will provide the best opportunity for the Company here as we see the back half of the year unfold.","Relative to automotive, it's very similar to what we've been consistently talking about -- driver assist systems, infotainment, a lot of what is required as we move up that autonomous driving food chain and as what are today considered to be advanced features in automotive, the automotive business penetrates mid and lower end cars. So that -- there's nothing particularly unique about what continues to drive that. It's the same unfolding story relative to memory deployment in the automotive sector.","Ernie Maddock","I think, if the question is do we participate in all of the various pieces of automotive end demand, the answer is yes. We're in the drivetrain. We're in the ADAS systems. We're in the infotainment systems and continue to maintain strong market share in all those pieces.","Steven Fox","Thanks very much for that. Just real quick on the first comments, on the -- just as it applies to cloud SSDs, your own cloud SSDs that you're launching, can you give a little more color on how broadly we should see those deployed maybe during the fall of this year?","Mark Durcan","Yes. I think you're going to see them very broadly deployed. As we noted, the initial uptakes of that SSD was announced in the early part of December of last year. The uptake has been very strong and we continue to see that growing at a significant rate here as we progress through the calendar year, along with some new features. We have a 5100 SATA drive with PCIE and NVMe coming soon as well, so we think that will help with the proliferation and the expansion of the demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen. Your question please.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you very much. I guess, Mark, I'm just looking at the guidance and you guys are guiding to a quarterly earnings number that's like 50% higher than you guys did in the last cycle, yet your stock is still $5.00 below where it peaked last time. And I know there are some changes in the cap structure and whatnot. But I guess the question really is what's the concern you hear from investors when you've been out there on the conference circuit this quarter? Are people worried about the sustainability of the cycle and like what is the big concern from your point of you and is that valid?","Mark Durcan","It's a good question. I think people are looking at the cycle and wondering are we getting long in the tooth, etc.? We start to read stuff about that. We're not seeing that at all. As mentioned, we're not seeing -- really what's driving this cycle when you think about it is broad-based demand across multiple market segments and in particular it's content growth in all of those segments as opposed to particularly strong unit growth in one segment or the other. And so as we look at the market today, it looks very robust from an end market demand and maybe much broader and less unit-driven than we've seen in the past.","We also see that the supply, as best we can tell, seems in control relative to demand. And I think, if you think about this cycle versus last cycle, what you saw -- what you saw last cycle was a big chunk of supply come off with the Hynix fire and the reaction with more supply to replace it and so maybe a little less stability than we're seeing this time around. So that's all on the DRAM side.","On the NAND side, this HDD replacement cycle is big. We're well into it in client. It's not going to stop in the cloud and enterprise. Mobile storage demand continues to accelerate. And so, again, it's broad-based content growth in all of those end applications and it's supply on the NAND side that's relatively capital-intensive to put in place with complex technology. And so there, again, that all seems like it's in pretty good shape.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. I guess just to follow onto that, so it looks like, based upon the guidance, that the gross margin in DRAM is going to be in excess of 50%. Usually, that doesn't last very long and people are obviously worried about Samsung adding a bunch of wafers. Why would that not happen this time? Based upon what you know, why would that not happen? And sort of what's your -- obviously, they have to add some wafers. But what's your base assumption for what the competition will do sort of in terms of bit growth this year? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Again, I think the last cycle was a little different with that instability in supply created by the Hynix fire. I don't know why they would intentionally repeat the mistake from last cycle. They probably are enjoying making good margins. And our view is we just go out and we look at what information is available relative to all the various additions people are making and might be making and what the timeframe that might occur in and then we give you -- you know, what we think that bit growth looks like. And that looks like it's probably actually -- Samsung is actually probably on the low end over the next couple of years relative to what's going on in the industry as a whole. And the industry as a whole is probably a little bit south of where we think demand growth is. So, could it happen? Yes. Why would it happen? I can't forecast that for you.","Ernie Maddock","This is Ernie. I think the important thing to bear in mind is, in the estimates that we've provided for supply growth this year of 15% to 20%, you would have to add some wafers to get into that range. Absent those wafer additions, you would be below the low end of that range, based on everything that we know. So, it is not a surprise that wafers are being added, given the forecast that we believe exists from the supply side.","Mark Durcan","And again, the other thing to keep in mind here is there are some natural impediments. The technology is getting more expensive to deploy. It's getting more difficult. And as we look to the future, we do see trends towards new technologies that might come into place out in time and that may be somewhat of an impediment to people as they think about do I really want to add incremental, significant new wafers to use supply when there may be competing technologies coming.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citi. Your question please.","Chris Danely","I didn't know I went from Jewish to Italian. Anyway, congrats. It feels like we have stepped into a time machine and got off in 1995. Can you just go through your price assumptions for the gross margin guide and then also maybe list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for beyond the May quarter?","Ernie Maddock","This is Ernie. You and I have been around each other long enough to know you're not going to get an answer to your first question. We don't give underlying pricing assumptions to derive our gross margin guidance. Our gross margin guidance stands on its own for what it is. Relative -- can you repeat the second piece, half, of your question please?","Chris Danely","Sure, just list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for wait for beyond the make order?","Ernie Maddock","Yes. So, to do that would be predicting a pricing curve which I also think is troublesome business. As we've talked about, right now, the pricing curve is much flatter than you typically see it and the normal sort of rules of thumb as you look at segments continue to be a little bit inverted as we experience this environment that we're in.","So, we have -- we never predict that things go up and to the right for an infinite period of time. You would expect that we would be thinking cautiously as we do our internal business planning which we do. We do apply a very consistent methodology to how we look at things, but we'ren't in a position to tell you when we think that the pricing curve would return to any sort of more normalized perspective that we would have from historical reference.","Chris Danely","That's fine. Since I whiffed on my first question, maybe you'll allow me another follow-up. You talked about delevering now that cash flow is pretty good. Maybe give us any insight into what would be or what would trigger you to start raising capital or restructure the debt? What would be the options out there?","Ernie Maddock","I think we're pretty consistent with what we said at our analyst day. We talked about 50% to 75% of a $1.5 billion number. We're on track for that. We'll do that at a time and a pace of our choosing based upon a wide variety of business circumstances, but we do, as I said in my script, remain committed to this and think that it's an important priority for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Mark Delaney","The first question was a follow-up on just the broader pricing environment. I'm not looking for any absolute number, but just hoping you could help us understand if the contract prices that Micron has seen are still below spot prices. Obviously spot prices rallied pretty significantly, but there's some time maybe before contract can catch up. And just, with what you're guiding at, do you think contract pricing is still below spot in your assumptions?","Ernie Maddock","Certainly, that's the case today. And don't forget we've also talked in the past about how some of our other segments have contracts of longer duration, so you would get the impact of a renewal of those contracts and, generally speaking, that those renewal -- that renewal pricing environment would continue to be favorable as well.","Mark Delaney","That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question, I know the Company talked a bit in the prepared remarks about certain mix shifts that it has been executing on, doing more in areas like SSDs and moving more towards server DRAM and creation. I was hoping you could help us understand how much more you think you can achieve in those areas through the rest of this fiscal year.","Ernie Maddock","Sure. So, on the SSD side of the house, as we mentioned I think in response to an earlier question, we think we're at the early days of what we're seeing in terms of penetration on our cloud and enterprise SSDs. I think we do have fairly good momentum and traction in clients in OEM. So that is how we're looking at or thinking about what the opportunities are on the SSD side of the house.","And then you also saw an increase in the percentage of the DRAM output that went into the server and cloud segment and we see those continuing to increase here or the demand side of it continuing to increase here, with all of the new data center deployments and a pretty strong demand environment for those.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Baird. Your question please.","Tristan Gerra","You mentioned that you 3D mix would exceed 75% by year-end in NAND. Could you remind me? Are you decommissioning 2D capacity or is that 3D capacity all incremental? And what kind of longer term ratio should we expect between 3D and 2D beyond this year?","Mark Durcan","It's a transition primarily from planar to 3D. If it were 100% transition which it's not, that ratio on a square footage basis might be something north of 2-to-1. But we have incremental space as well, so it's not exactly like that.","Tristan Gerra","Okay. And then could you also remind me, as you transition from 2D to 3D, for the same wafer capacity, what type of bit growth do you get with 64 layer?","Mark Durcan","From a 2D planar NAND, from a planar NAND wafer to a 64 layer 3D NAND wafer?","Tristan Gerra","Correct, yes.","Mark Durcan","It might be -- it's north of 300%, closer to 4X.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer of Summit Redstone. Your question please.","Jagadish Iyer","Thanks for taking my question, two questions. First, in terms of the DRAM bit supply, given that you have had Inotera under your belt, I'm curious why your bit shipments were only in the low single digits. And then I have follow-up.","Ernie Maddock","Inotera has always been part of our output and measured in our bit shipments, so the transaction -- the formal closing of the transaction really did not represent an incremental addition to the Company's bit supply.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay, fair enough. Then on the pricing environment for DRAM, what contributed to the 21% increase? Was there any specific subsegment of DRAM that you saw strength? And do you think that this is a one-time event or how should we think about it? I know you would not give more clarity on pricing going forward, but any color specifically on the 21% increase would be helpful.","Ernie Maddock","We've all been able to read every week about what's happened to DRAM exchange with respect to spot pricing and certainly that trend as influenced every single other segment. So I think, as Mark mentioned in his script, while last quarter the pricing was more focused around what was happening in the client and OEM markets, this quarter, the impact of that having extended over time and consistent with our earlier comments been subject to some of these contract renewals, are starting to manifest themselves across mobile, across enterprise and really the full breadth of the DRAM product portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your question please.","John Pitzer","Ernie, I know you're not going to talk about kind of forward pricing assumptions in the May guide, but when you look at the May guide and just how significantly above investor expectations it were, I was wondering if you could help us quantify or qualify a little bit to what extent is this being driven by cyclical leverage, like-for-like pricing, versus things that might have a little bit more longevity like your ability to mix into better end markets or your ability to cost-down or just operational efficiencies. And as you answer the question, I'd be curious just to see your view on whether or not you believe you are starting to close that cost cap with some of your peers out there.","Ernie Maddock","I think, one, to reiterate something we said earlier, but it is very important, we're really consistent quarter to quarter with how we think about our guidance. So there was no dramatic change from a methodology point of view in that.","And I think, John, you actually hit on many of the points that are contributing to that nice uptick in margin. So, first, we do have a broad profile and that allows us to move between segments and really maximize the opportunity between those segments. And as you saw this quarter, we're tilting more to cloud and enterprise which we think represents some good, long term opportunity for the Company. We have system-level solutions that utilize the breadth of the Company's product portfolio in things like MCPs and builds on the capabilities of the Company with things like SSDs. You have a better technology execution or strong technology execution, in terms of where we have been in the past, so the gap is closing. We've been consistently telling you that we think it will close and we're going to continue to make progress in that regard.","And then you do have leverage that comes from the scale that we have achieved over the course of the last two or three years as we've made these technology transitions. So, really, I think, to the point you are making, this is not only about pricing. It's about pricing and everything else that we've been working on collectively as a team to deliver broad operational capability into all of our end markets.","John Pitzer","Then maybe as my follow-up, Mark, in your prepared comments, you talked about having meaningful 1X volume by the end of this fiscal year. I'm wondering if you could quantify what you mean by meaningful. And I guess, from my perspective, it seems like a little bit earlier than I would have expected. Is that true? And if so, are you just finding it an easier ramp? And can you remind us of sort of the cost-downs you expect to get with the move to 1X?","Mark Durcan","I don't want to put too much specificity around exactly where we will end up at the end of the year on a bit mix, but I will tell you that you will recall, at the analyst day, we shared with you that we believe we were making very good progress on our 1X nanometer yield ramp at that time and that continues to go really very smoothly with a good progress in both Taiwan and Japan. So, we're very happy with the way it's going and we will continue to monitor that and drive it appropriately.","I will say also that there's a pretty good suite of products that penetrate a number of different end market segments and those qualifications are going well and those products are looking very robust. And I'm happy with the way that's coming along.","From a cost perspective, I think greater than 20% is what we've indicated in the past and that's probably a good place to leave it for now. At the end of the day, it will depend on mix. We've got a lot of different products going in a lot of different segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Joe Moore","I'm wondering if you could touch on the NAND prices being down sequentially. I was little surprised to see that relative to what we're hearing.","Mark Durcan","It's primarily around mix. We're shipping a lot of high density TLC 3D product versus, previously, we had some lower density products hanging out in some pretty small niches as our volume has gone up and as we've begun to drive more towards some of these higher density cloud type applications. We're doing more those types of products and all of the pricing is down. They are driving some pretty significant cost improvements for us as well. And so, from a margin perspective, that's definitely where we want to be moving through time here.","Joe Moore","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then your inventory picked up a little bit and I was surprised to see that because I know how much customers want product. Can you just talk about, that and did that sort of -- is that the ramp in NAND or what are we seeing there?","Ernie Maddock","Consistent with sort of the ambitious plans we have around the SSD market, I would say the majority of that was attributable to that build-up. And in addition to that, if you are doing a quarter-on quarter compare, Inotera on the DRAM side was not considered part of the inventory in the December quarter -- or sorry, in the prior quarter -- whereas it's currently part of our inventory. So that was really a significant part of the increase on the DRAM side. So, it's those two things.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your question please.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Kristen Shak [ph] in for Romit Shah. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the great quarter, guys. My first question, you gave some helpful commentary about the bit growth for the second half of fiscal 2017 versus the first half of fiscal 2017. I was just wondering if you could give some color about how we should think about the cost declines for the second half versus the first half. I'm not looking for anything, really concrete numbers, just anything qualitative would be great.","Ernie Maddock","I think the best way I would guide you do there is we have actually provided what we thought was going to be a fiscal year -- a fiscal year cost-down target for both technologies and we've now given you all of the pieces that you need to compute that. So, that's how I would guide you to come up with your estimate of what you think our cost-downs are going to be.","Unidentified Analyst","And then we're still seeing a lot of the spec-ing uptrends for Chinese smartphones, especially in DRAM. With the strong pricing that we've seen in DRAM over the past few months, do you see that trend changing or do you see that trend continuing? Any color there would be great.","Mark Durcan","Sorry, the question around Chinese phones was content or --","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, content, mainly in DRAM content.","Mark Durcan","We continue to see, in the lower-end and midtier phones, we continue to see pretty good content growth. Yes, there is more of a concern at the high end in terms of what eventually will people stop taking densities up there, but even at the high end, I think we anticipate some continued growth with 6 to 8 gigabits at the top. But in the lower-tier and mid-tier smartphones, we still see pretty robust growth and so, in aggregate, when we look at mobile, we're thinking in terms of 30% bit growth there this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your question please.","David Ryzhik","This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just two if I can. Just how can we think about contract discussions with customers? Are you seeing more long term type of duration negotiations? And I just had a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Mark Durcan","It's very different segment to segment, customer to customer. So, I wouldn't say that there is a huge sea change, although clearly there are some customers in this kind of environment that are interested in lengthier relationships.","David Ryzhik","Great. And for 3D NAND, any update on timing of QLC introduction and would you introduce it at the 64 layer density? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","Yes, we're not going to be too specific yet about our QLC plans, but we will confirm that we're happy with the way that technology is progressing. And that's probably all we've got to say for now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Mertens of Needham & Company. Your question please.","Robert Mertens","Just two quick questions on behalf of Raji Gill. You spoke a little bit towards the yields with 3D NAND on the 32 layer. Could you just talk a little bit about your competitive advantage going forward on the 3D NAND side and then also just give a little bit more color on your gross margin trajectory and how we should think about that throughout the year? Thank you.","Mark Durcan","We're not going to give you gross margins, as Ernie already indicated unfortunately. We're just not going to go there. But relative to our competitive position on 3D NAND, we feel very good about it. I would direct you back to the comments we made in the slides we showed at the analyst conference a couple of months ago.","We're very happy with our 32 layer yields. We're very happy with how we're progressing on our 64 layer spec. And we think we're in the lead position relative to our cost effectiveness and our density and our ability to deliver products at all the [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your question please.","C.J. Muse","Can you guys -- first question -- update us on your thoughts in terms of DRAM supply demand for this year? And are we to assume that tightening shortages should continue through the calendar year? And then assuming the wafers that you already have baked into that 15% to 20% supply, if we don't see new wafers next year and we just think about a world that shrinks, how should we think about supply into calendar 2018?","Mark Durcan","We really don't have an update for you. It's still, in our view, it's 15% to 20% supply growth this year, could actually be less than that if there's less new wafers than we have in our plan. Demand is still 20% plus. Next year, we would be in the teens if we don't get the new wafers.","C.J. Muse","Great. And as a follow-up, you talked about second-half DRAM bits being 10% higher than first-half. I'm assuming that's production. Can you hit that on a sales basis or should we assume slightly less, given the timing of 1X?","Ernie Maddock","No, that was representative of what we think will ultimately be reflected in our financial statements.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin of UBS. Your question please.","Stephen Chin","I had a question on, first of all, for the NAND flash business with mobile being only 20% of the sales there. I was wondering. Just given the relatively low exposure there currently relative to the overall market, is that implying that, for the second half of the year, you are expecting you'll see a lot of seasonality that's helping to drive some of the second-half 30% half-on-half growth?","Ernie Maddock","Again, the 30% was a function of our output and we would direct that output into the various outlets that we have, whether it be the SSD business, the mobile business, etc. So, we will sort of wait and see how that plays out here as we get to the back half of the year.","Stephen Chin","Okay, that's fair. As my follow-up, in terms of the gross margin guidance, can you talk a bit about the implied cost reductions on both DRAM and NAND flash for this quarter's guidance? Just given the relatively high output for your 20 nanometer DRAM and also I guess the ramping nature of 32 layer 3D, is there still a lot of cost reduction in the current quarter from both of those technologies?","Ernie Maddock","Again, I'd kind of refer you back to the full-year guidance that we provided which was rather specific. We have now completed two quarters of that year and we've given you a view of the back-half bit growth. So I think we've given you all the building blocks that you need to derive a gross margin profile and that's not something that we typically share. And operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","We have a question from Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Mark Newman","I have a question around your supply growth, given there is such strong pricing out there in the market. So, firstly, can you talk about what the underlying wafer capacity trend is doing for Micron in both DRAM and NAND this year? And related to that, how much flexibility, given how strong pricing is today, how much flexibility does Micron have to add more either this calendar year or next year? I'm not saying that you will. Just how much flexibility do you have to add more if, for whatever economic means reasons, you could make the calculation that it does make sense to add more? Thanks.","Mark Durcan","I think the best way -- as best as we going to characterize wafers would be to say it's pretty stable. We're very focused on technology transitions. We're not focused on adding more supply, so we're just utilizing the existing capacity and transitioning it through advanced nodes. We do have white space in both our Fab 16 in Taichung as well as Fab 10X, but we're not planning any capacity additions this year. And if we were to decide we wanted to which I think is unlikely, for us, as for our competitors, there is significant leadtime at the moment for equipment and it would take quite a while to bring that on in the marketplace.","Mark Newman","Is it possible to quantify how much it would be in terms of wafers? Again, not saying you're going to add it, but just how much capacity you have the ability -- and how much do you have the ability to add in both DRAM and NAND?","Mark Durcan","No and, again, it's kind of moot. So, thanks for the questions.","Ernie Maddock","This is Ernie. Before we close, I wanted to share with everyone that Ivan is going to be transitioning out of his IR role into another role here at Micron and I wanted to personally express my appreciation to him for his support of the Company during his tenure in IR, including bringing me up to speed which was quite challenging, I'm sure. We will miss him very, very much. We're in the process of determining how best to fill his shoes, but in the interim, Liz Morali will be the primary IR contact point. And with that, we will say thanks again for your participation and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Mark Durcan","Thank you everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Farhan Ahmad. Sir, please go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you and welcome to Micron Technology's first fiscal quarter 2020 financial conference call. On the call with me today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO; and Dave Zinsner, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. This call including the audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com. In addition, our website contains the earnings press release and the prepared remarks filed a short while ago.","Today's discussion of financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today's date to conform these statements to actual results.","I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you. Farhan. Good afternoon.","Micron is off to a solid start in our fiscal 2020. Despite a challenging industry environment, we delivered good profitability, maintained positive free cash flow, and strengthened our product portfolio.","Industry supply demand balance continues to improve in both DRAM and NAND. Recent trends in our business give us optimism that our fiscal second quarter will mark the bottom for our financial performance, which we expect to start improving in our fiscal third quarter, with continued recovery in the second half of calendar 2020.","Our strategy to increase high-value solutions, enhance customer engagement, and improve our cost structure is producing results. We have materially improved our competitive position, structurally strengthened our profitability, and are poised to drive long term shareholder value as industry conditions improve.","High-value solutions in fiscal 2019 accounted for approximately 50% of NAND bits. We expect this figure to grow to over two-thirds of our NAND bits sold for fiscal 2020, and we remain on track to drive 80% of our NAND bits into high-value solutions in fiscal 2021. This mix improvement is an important tailwind for us as it improves our profitability and reduces the volatility in our margins.","At our Micron Insight event in October, we articulated a vision for Micron's transformation through greater vertical integration and differentiated products for the new data economy. I will highlight two of these and encourage you to view Sumit Sadana's Insight keynote, available on our website, for more detail.","First, we announced the acquisition of a small company called FWDNXT. The FWDNXT Deep Learning Accelerator, hardware and software technology, when combined with advanced Micron memory, makes it possible to deploy neural network models from any framework into edge devices for inference. FWDNXT's unique technology is an important capability in our portfolio that will help us learn and better address customers' needs in the evolving AI ecosystem.","At Insight, we also launched our first 3D XPoint product, the X100, which is the world's fastest storage device. The Micron X100 SSD is dramatically faster than any other SSD, including those built with NAND or 3D XPoint technology, and we are proud that it was showcased at Microsoft's Ignite conference by their Azure team.","In October, we closed our acquisition of Intel's stake in the IMFT joint venture. We plan on relocating equipment and certain manufacturing employees to other Micron sites as we right-size the Lehi fab. Redeploying equipment will also help us optimize Micron's front-end equipment CapEx. As with any","innovative technology, it will take time to scale up our 3D XPoint product portfolio, ramp revenues, and achieve healthy margins, and we are excited about the long-term potential of 3D XPoint for both memory and storage applications.","As the only company in the world with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND, and 3D XPoint technologies, we are in a unique position to develop differentiated products for our customers.","I will now turn to technology and manufacturing operations. In DRAM, our industry-leading 1Z LP4 DRAM-based uMCP had the fastest revenue ramp of any product in the history of our mobile business. Our production mix on 1Z will increase throughout 2020, and DRAM cost reductions will be skewed toward the second half of FY2020.","Our previously announced cleanroom expansion in Taiwan is on track, and we expect output in calendar 2021. This cleanroom expansion is EUVcapable. While we continue to evaluate EUV technology for deployment in DRAM production, our current assessment shows superior economics through 1 gamma node utilizing advanced immersion technology along with Micron's proprietary multi-patterning technologies. We are encouraged by recent industry progress on EUV productivity and will be prepared to deploy EUV when it becomes cost effective to do so.","In NAND, we are continuing to make progress on our replacement gate transition and expect to begin production on our 128-layer, first-generation RG node in the second half of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this node will be deployed for a limited set of products, and we expect minimal NAND cost reduction in fiscal 2020.","It will be followed by an introduction of a higher-layer-count, second-generation RG node in fiscal 2021 targeted for a broader implementation, which will begin to provide more robust cost reduction as it ramps. This second-generation RG node will leverage our NAND technology leadership in CMOS under the array, as well as QLC.","Now turning to highlights by products and markets. In SSDs, demand from data center customers was strong in fiscal first quarter. Attach rates and capacities for client and consumer SSDs have continued to increase across our customers. There are supply shortages for SSDs across the industry, and pricing trends are improving. We are making strong progress on our transition to NVMe.","As of fiscal second quarter, we will have NVMe SSDs for all market segments, which positions us to gain share in fiscal 2020. NVMe client SSD bit shipments represented almost three-quarters of our client SSD bits in fiscal Q1, versus virtually none a year ago.","In the data center market, sales of our previously announced high-performance NVMe SSD nearly tripled quarter-over-quarter, and we announced a 96-layer mainstream data center NVMe SSD. While growing our presence in NVMe, we continue to maximize our value proposition for the SATA market by ramping 96-layer NAND products. We achieved qualifications with multiple OEMs on our 96-layer SATA data center SSD.","Our QLC technology continues to gain traction. We have QLC SSDs in volume production for SATA SSDs in the data center and consumer markets, as well as NVME SSDs for the consumer market. We became the first company to ship a 96-layer, second-generation QLC SATA consumer SSD.","In mobile, F1Q MCP DRAM and NAND bits grew approximately 50% quarter-over-quarter, and our MCP market share increased approximately 50% year-over-year. In fiscal Q1, our leading-edge 1Z LP4 DRAM-based uMCP achieved qualification at multiple OEMs, driving the fastest mobile product revenue ramp, I mentioned earlier.","We are confident that 5G will be positive for both memory and storage content growth, as well as smartphone unit sales, and are encouraged to see the launch of affordable 5G phones with price points as low as $300 that feature a minimum of 6 gigabyte of DRAM. The 5G phones launched to date average 8 gigabyte of DRAM and 200 gigabyte of NAND, significantly higher than the average content in smartphones today.","Our leadership on DRAM power efficiency continues to drive customer preference for our products, and we remain well positioned in this market. We have the lowest-power and highest-bandwidth LP5 product that begins volume production this quarter, which we expect will become more important in 2021 as 5G adoption accelerates.","In data center, strong server DRAM demand in the second half of calendar 2019 is creating an industrywide shortage of high-quality, high-density modules, for which we are seeing incremental demand from our customers. New CPU architectures supporting higher-density chips and increased number of channels are driving strong DRAM content growth in servers. In fiscal Q1, we saw strong demand growth from enterprise and cloud customers.","In graphics, bit shipments remained stable with GDDR6 PC graphics cards showing strong growth, offset by seasonal weakness in gaming consoles. In fiscal Q1, we began shipments of our new 14 gigabit per second GDDR6 and are well positioned to benefit from the launch of next-generation gaming consoles in calendar 2020.","The launch of these new gaming consoles will drive robust multi-year demand in graphics memory, and these consoles will deploy SSDs in place of hard drives for the first time. This continues a trend of SSDs replacing hard drives across more high-volume applications.","In the PC market, bit shipments in fiscal first quarter continued the growth trend from last quarter. Nevertheless, we are cautious on our near-term outlook for the PC segment due to reported CPU shortages, which seem likely to continue at least into early calendar 2020.","In automotive, despite sluggish worldwide auto sales, we saw quarter-over-quarter revenue growth driven by secular memory and storage content growth. Our leadership in low-power DRAM is also driving growth for us in this market.","In fiscal first quarter, we qualified and shipped the industry's first BGA NVMe SSD for automotive applications, which offers industry-leading performance and capacity in a small form factor and is well-suited to service the storage needs of increasing autonomous features.","Now turning to our market outlook. Our base-case assumption on which all our projections are based, assumes that there are no perturbations to the demand environment due to macroeconomic conditions or trade-related developments.","In DRAM, there has been a strong recovery in the second half of calendar 2019, and our view of calendar 2019 industry bit demand growth has increased to approximately 20%. This stronger than expected demand has resulted in pockets of shortages for us. We continue to exercise price discipline and walk away from price requests that do not meet our objectives.","While these actions may impact short-term revenue, improving our business mix will enhance our long-term profitability. We are encouraged by recent DRAM pricing trends and are optimistic about improving supply demand balance throughout calendar 2020.","As we discussed on our last call, a portion of the strength in demand in the second half of calendar 2019 may be attributable to inventory builds in China, and we expect some of this customer inventory to normalize sometime in calendar 2020. As a result, we expect calendar 2020 industry DRAM bit demand growth to be in the mid-teens percent range year-over-year, which is somewhat lower than our prior outlook, due to stronger demand in calendar 2019.","We expect industry bit supply growth for calendar 2020 to be somewhat less than the demand as industry bit supply growth decelerates due to industry CapEx reductions. We continue to target our long-term bit supply growth CAGR to be close to the industry's long-term bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens. In calendar 2019, our bit supply growth will be less than the industry supply growth of mid-teens, and in 2020 our bit supply growth is expected to be slightly above industry bit supply growth.","Turning to NAND, our industry bit demand growth expectation is in the mid-40% range in calendar 2019, and high 20s to low 30s percent range in calendar 2020. We expect calendar 2020 industry bit supply to be lower than industry bit demand as a result of industry CapEx reductions, and consequently, we expect the industry environment to improve through calendar 2020.","Micron's NAND bit supply growth in calendar 2019 is likely to be slightly below industry bit demand growth and in calendar 2020 will be meaningfully below that of the industry. However, we expect our NAND bit shipment growth in calendar 2020 to be close to industry bit demand growth as we ship our inventory during the first generation of our RG transition. As we go through the transition to replacement gate, we expect our multi-year supply growth CAGR to be in line with the industry's demand CAGR of approximately 30%.","Before I turn it over to Dave, I wanted to provide an update on our business with Huawei. As previously disclosed, we are continuing to ship some products to Huawei that are not subject to Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions. We applied for, and recently received, all requested licenses that enable us to provide support for these products, as well as qualify new products for Huawei's mobile and server businesses.","Additionally, these licenses allow us to ship previously restricted products that we manufacture in the United States, which represent a very small portion of our sales. However, there are still some products outside of the mobile and server markets that we are unable to sell to Huawei.","Receiving the licenses is a positive development, and we are thankful to the U.S. administration for approving these licenses. Prior to receiving these licenses, Entity List restrictions severely limited our ability to qualify new products at Huawei.","Although, we are now able to qualify new products with Huawei's mobile and server businesses, it will take some time before the qualifications are completed and contribute to revenue. Consequently, we do not expect these licenses to have a material impact on our revenue in the next couple of quarters.","I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.","David Zinsner","Thanks Sanjay.","Micron's FQ1 results were largely consistent with our expectations as market conditions continued to stabilize. During the quarter, DRAM price declines decelerated from recent quarters, and we saw pricing improvements in NAND.","Total company revenues grew sequentially, and our total inventory declined in absolute terms. We generated positive free cash flow during the quarter, made progress on our share repurchase program, and further strengthened our balance sheet.","The results on today's call reflect our previously announced changes in NAND depreciable life to seven years from five years, and the change in reporting from our previous disclosures, which classified all MCP and SSD revenues as NAND revenue, to a view now that disaggregates these revenues into DRAM and NAND.","The following DRAM and NAND growth figures use restated historical revenues for an apples-to-apples comparison. Total FQ1 revenue was approximately $5.1 billion. Revenue was up 6% sequentially and down 35% year-over-year. FQ1 DRAM revenue was $3.5 billion, representing 67% of total revenue.","DRAM revenue increased 2% sequentially and declined 41% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew approximately 10% sequentially and on a year-on-year basis were up in the mid-20% range. ASP declined in the upper-single-digit percent range sequentially. DRAM revenues included $435 million of revenues from MCPs and SSDs.","FQ1 NAND revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, or 28% of total revenue. Revenue was up 18% sequentially and declined 14% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew in the mid-teen percent range sequentially and in the mid-30% range year-on-year. ASPs increased in the low-single digits sequentially.","Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was approximately $2 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and down 45% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher volumes and moderating ASP declines.","Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 34% year-over-year. MCP revenues grew strongly during the quarter driven by approximately 50% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND bits.","Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in FQ1 was $968 million, an increase of 14% from FQ4 and down 15% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth was driven by SSD volume growth and ASP increases.","Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $734 million, up 4% from FQ4 and down 21% from the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was mostly driven by the automotive market due to content growth.","The consolidated gross margin for FQ1 was 27.3%, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. FQ1 gross margins included approximately a 240-basis point negative impact or approximately $125 million due to underutilization charges at the Lehi Fab. This came in slightly better than we guided to on last quarter's call, but underutilization charges are expected to ramp higher in FQ2 as production volumes decline.","We still expect the underutilization charges to average $150 million per quarter in the first half of fiscal 2020. We have taken action to reduce our spending in the Lehi Fab, which should begin to reduce underutilization charges in fiscal 2021 as these actions are implemented. Ultimately, these charges will be mitigated as our own 3D XPoint products ramp into production over the coming years.","Operating expenses were $811 million as we incurred higher than usual R&D expenses to qualify new products. We expect to operate at higher levels of qualification expenses for the remainder of fiscal 2020 as we continue to expand our product portfolio.","As a result, we now expect operating expenses to be approximately $3.3 billion for the fiscal year. We continue to prudently control all other operating expenses and remain flexible, should business conditions warrant.","FQ1 operating income was $594 million, representing 12% of revenue. Operating margin was down 38 percentage points year-over-year and down 3 percentage points from FQ4. Our FQ1 effective tax rate was 6.9%. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 5% for the remainder of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ1 were $0.48 down from $0.56 in FQ4 and $2.97 in the year-ago quarter.","Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2 billion in cash from operations in FQ1, representing 40% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, down from approximately $2 billion in the prior quarter. We are continuing to target FY '20 CapEx in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion.","We generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $80 million in FQ1 compared to $260 million last quarter, and approximately $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.","In FQ1, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $50 million. In addition, we deployed approximately $200 million of cash to settle convertible note redemptions in the quarter removing approximately 3 million shares from our fully diluted share count. We will continue to target deploying at least 50% of our annual free cash flow toward repurchases.","Days of inventory was 121, down from 131 days in FQ4. Inventory ended the quarter at $4.9 billion, down slightly from $5.1 billion at the end of FQ4. Over the last two quarters, our inventory days have declined by approximately 15%. We expect inventory days to increase in fiscal Q2 due to seasonality and then begin to reduce again for the remainder of the year.","We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.3 billion and total liquidity of nearly $11 billion. We deployed approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity in FQ1 to fund the closing of our acquisition of Intel's stake in the IMFT joint venture. FQ1 ending total debt was $5.7 billion, down slightly from the prior quarter.","In addition to the retirement of IMFT's member debt, we used cash on hand to retire approximately $520 million in principal of high-yield debt. This was partially offset by the draw-down of our term loan facility to fund the IMFT acquisition.","Our balance sheet is very strong with net cash of $2.7 billion, and we remain committed to maintaining a net cash position. Last month, S&P upgraded Micron's credit rating to investment grade, and now all three rating agencies rate Micron's credit as investment grade.","Now turning to our financial outlook. As Sanjay mentioned, our outlook throughout our earnings commentary assumes that the macroeconomic environment and trade-related issues will not impact demand. Micron's fiscal second quarter is the seasonally weakest quarter for the industry. We continue to exercise pricing discipline and reduce business at customers where pricing does not meet our objectives, and this limits our business opportunity within the quarter.","Additionally, in FQ2 pockets of supply tightness are limiting our bit shipments, Lehi underutilization costs are going to step up, and our cost reductions are likely to remain modest. However, we are encouraged by recent market trends and expect that FQ2 will be the bottom of our gross margins, as pricing, increasing mix of high-value solutions, and cost reductions drive better gross margins throughout the rest of fiscal and calendar 2020. We expect a gradual recovery to start in FQ3, and to continue into the seasonally stronger second half of calendar year.","With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, gross margin to be in the range of 27% plus or minus 150 basis points, and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Interest and other income is expected to be approximately zero. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.35, plus or minus $0.06.","As we approach the trough in this cycle, at the midpoint of our guidance, fiscal Q2 revenue will be 60% higher and gross margins 9 percentage points higher than in the prior trough, which occurred in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Micron's solid financial performance and investment-grade balance sheet demonstrate that the New Micron is indeed structurally stronger, with higher lows and better cross-cycle revenue growth and profitability.","I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Dave.","Micron is entering 2020 as a fundamentally stronger company, in an industry that is structurally transformed. Supply growth is moderating due to rising capital intensity and the slowing of Moore's Law. Demand drivers are more diversified than ever before, both in end markets and in the variety of memory and storage solutions. This change in industry dynamics creates new opportunities for Micron to innovate and provide differentiated value to customers.","Nascent applications promise to further accelerate this diversification. Cloud growth continues at a brisk pace, driven by new use cases, and 5G networks are just beginning to proliferate and will usher in an age of true machine-to-machine communication with billions of connected devices.","And just a little further over the horizon, AI, machine learning, and autonomous technologies will expand this potential even more. These trends are transforming every aspect of human life and driving secular growth in memory and storage.","Micron's enhanced product portfolio, improved cost structure, and talented team put us in an outstanding position to capitalize on the wealth of opportunities ahead and create long-term shareholder value.","We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri of SMBC Nikko. Your line is open.","Srini Pajjuri","Sanjay, just a couple of questions. I guess first on the supply shortages that you talked about, could you please elaborate because on one hand, you were talking about some shortages, on the other hand, the inventories are going up as we head into the next quarter. I'm going to have a follow-up.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So as we said last time as well as in this earnings call that we have certain shortages in DRAM on the leading-edge nodes. And you we have brought down our inventory here, overall inventory down fairly fast as Dave pointed out. And we have seen strong growth in demand in DRAM on high-quality, high-density modules for servers, as well as demand trends have continued to be pretty solid.","So shortages on the leading-edge nodes on DRAM and on the NAND side, we have SSD demand growing up substantially. And our 96-layer products, as we expand the portfolio are being qualified by customers. We are seeing strong demand on our 64-layer node, where we are actually seeing some shortages and of course, as we mentioned, we experienced some back-end constraints as well.","We have invested in back-end capacity, assembly and test capacity expansion. And that's - we'll - assembly and test issues impacting some of our multi-die stack on the Mobile solutions as well as SSD solutions. The assembly and test constraints will be eliminated, largely by the end of fiscal second quarter.","So these are some of the things that are impacting, some of the shortages, both in DRAM and on the NAND side. And again the demand trends continue to be solid. Of course in CQ1, we see seasonality. And yes, some of our inventory may go up at the end of fiscal Q2.","But overall our normal inventory days is around, - as we look ahead is around 110 days, and you know that's really a function of increasing complexity coming from the technology nodes, as well as, as we shift toward high value solutions, more SSDs, more multi-chip packages, they take longer assembly and test times as well.","So those are the ones that are contributing to some of the aspects of days of inventory that when we foresee in the future, we look at it as approximately 110 days.","So industry environment in terms of demand continues to be solid, pockets of shortage is building all across the industry, certainly we are experiencing that. And pricing trends overall in the industry, as you look ahead at 2020, we are optimistic about the improving pricing trends in the industry as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Congratulations on the solid results. So, Sanjay, I wanted to talk a little bit about the CapEx guidance for this fiscal year. I think I understand the strategy around NAND to kind of constrained spending on the first generation of replacement gate, where cost downs are de minimis and kind of weight to Version 2.0. But I'm kind of curious as you think about the DRAM strategy, especially given that demand came in much stronger than expected, this year, 20%, and there were some of us that thought at the beginning the year, we'd be lucky to get to low double-digit growth. How do we think about DRAM CapEx from here and your ability to kind of keep up with industry bit growth? And I guess specifically my question is, how much, leeway do you have in moving more of your mix of DRAM toward the leading-edge node as a way to grow bits rather than just shrinking?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Certainly as we move our DRAM production to leading-edge nodes, for example, through 1Z, where we mentioned that we did very well with ramping 1Z DRAM node in our mobile products during the quarter. So of course those give us a bit growth. It comes with the shrink capability and technology transitions are the best way to achieve ROI as well.","What's important is, that we are being extremely disciplined and prudent in terms of managing our supply of bit growth and we want to make sure that it's aligned with our bit demand growth as well as our long-term objective is to have our supply bit growth CAGR to be aligned with the industry demand growth CAGR.","We mentioned that in 2019, our DRAM supply growth somewhat below the industry supply growth and in fiscal year 2020, we - in calendar year 2020, we see our supply growth to be somewhat above the industry supply growth. But all in all, our strategy is to have our supply growth CAGR to be aligned with the industry demand growth CAGR.","We feel very good about, - when we look ahead at 2020, our supply, overall position, and yes, I mean we are experiencing certain shortages on leading-nodes, and we believe that some of these shortages in the industry, as well as for us will continue in calendar year 2020 timeframe. And frankly that's a good place to be at in terms of running the business, because it helps you manage the best mix of the business as well in terms of revenue and profitability.","Operator","Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse","I guess a question on the DRAM demand side. You're outlining an outlook for 15 - sorry, mid-teens growth in 2020. I am curious as you think about that number, how much of that, I guess, relates to potential pulling of China demand, potential conservatism on your part? And within that, what kind of assumptions are you making around 5G handsets and continued cloud spending through 2020? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So certainly 5G will be a growth driver. We expect 5G handset smartphones to be more weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. Cloud CapEx as you have seen the reports from various major cloud providers, cloud CapEx continues to be healthy, a meaningful portion of the cloud CapEx goes into memory and storage, and that continues to drive above average industry - above average demand as a percentage, which is the average of the total DRAM industry.","And 5G phones, I think it's important to note that you content continues to grow as we mentioned in our script. I mean of course, 4G phones content continues to grow, but 5G phones are driving a step-level function increase in the average content of both DRAM as well as NAND. And our estimation is that in calendar year 2020, approximately 200 million of 5G smartphones to be sold on a global basis.","So overall, when we look at the demand - industry demand of mid-teens that we have projected for calendar year 2020, keep in mind that is building upon calendar year 2019, where industry demand in the second half came in quite strong and in fact we upped our estimate of industry demand growth to approximately 20% for 2019. So you are working off a large demand, larger than previously expected total bit shipments in 2019, and obviously that has an impact on the percentage that we look at for 2020.","But in terms of aggregate of bit demand, that continues to be pretty solid in 2020 as well. And as we said, 2019 was a headwind in terms of demand and supply for the industry and 2020, we look at demand and supply balance as a tailwind for the industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","I guess just on the capital expenditure front, obviously you guys have talked about, reiterated to CapEx, but you're also - on the Taiwan fab, you're noting that fab is capable of EUV. I know you've talked about that you don't need that through the 1 gamma node, but it kind of suggests that you are looking at EUV as potentially something that you're evaluating. Have you pulled it, all your thoughts on EUV? And how do we think about that in the context of CapEx, not necessarily this year but looking out into the subsequent years? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So at this point we're not providing guidance for any time frame beyond our fiscal year 2020 in terms of CapEx. But as we have always said, we have been evaluating EUV technology. We have carefully evaluated EUV technology in terms of determining our roadmap for DRAM. And as you noted, through - we have said that through 1 gamma node, today we are in production with now 1Z node, starting production with 1Z and of course volume production also of 1Y node.","So from 1Y to 1Z, as we look ahead at the next few generations through 1 alpha, 1 beta and 1 gamma generations, we see that of multi-patterning techniques along with immersion technology will serve us well in terms of achieving our cost objectives and having a highly cost competitive roadmap for us.","So we have also said that we continue to evaluate EUV, and then we see it appropriate for deployment in our DRAM production. In terms of cost and efficiency of production, we will certainly be deploying it at a future time in that, but at this point, we see our technology roadmap through 1 gamma node to be in strong position, while we remain encouraged seeing the improvement in EUV productivity tool as well.","But regarding CapEx for future years, we'll obviously always manage it as a function of our supply growth expectations as well as a function of technology and cost competitiveness and keeping our supply growth, as I said previously, aligned with demand CAGR, that's how we will manage it. And we'll share those details with you at appropriate time in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","So to better understand the company's commentary on its own inventory, which - nice to see that come down in dollars and days in the just completed quarter. You - as you think about your inventory, as you move through the year, I understood some of the aggregate commentary, but can you, a bit more specific, because I think, the company has been carrying extra inventory of some of these older DRAM nodes, when do you think that gets used up?","And when you talk about 110 days, Sanjay, is that being a more normal level of inventory? Just given because the company is going to be carrying the extra NAND inventory for the replacement gate node. Should we be thinking about inventory running above 110 to allow for that this year, or is the 110, really a this year comment as you carry some of that extra replacement gate inventory, and is longer term it's something lower than that? Thanks.","David Zinsner","Yes, that's a good question. So, I'll try and take a crack at that first. So yeah, the comment around 110 days is kind of an optimal level of inventory when we have worked off all of the excess inventory associated with the replacement gate transition and as inventories normalize.","Obviously, in the 121 days of inventory that we have today, DRAM is a bit below that, really what pulls it up to a 121 is that, NAND is quite a bit higher than that by virtue of the fact that we are executing on this strategy to hold a lot of inventory as we go into our replacement gate transition to augment what will be a robust bit growth from that first node.","As Sanjay mentioned, we do expect days of inventory to go up a bit based on mix and so forth in the second quarter, because of seasonality. But we would expect it then to start trending down over the next few quarters, partly as we start to utilize this success - of NAND inventory for the replacement gate transition and also as we start to digest and administer this - the mix challenges that have created a little bit of excess spill on the DRAM front. So, we should be in pretty healthy place on DRAM within a couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Good to see you power through this downturn with positive free cash flow. I just wanted to get back to the comment that Sanjay, you're making about the fiscal second quarter marking the bottom for fundamentals. And CapEx seems to be a little bit front-end loaded, so is free cash flow going to be positive in the fiscal second quarter as well?","David Zinsner","So I'll take a crack at that one too. I would say, maybe to start with, that the first priority of the company is to make the appropriate level investments, both in terms of R&D and which is why we have had a little bit of an increase in operating expenses, because we do want to put the right level of investment in new products, particularly high value solution products that will ultimately be the big factor in terms of our performance over the coming years.","And in addition, we obviously want to make the appropriate level in terms of CapEx investments to make sure that we are, as Sanjay mentioned, investing the right level to manage supply growth and to make these node transitions.","Secondarily, of course, our goal is to generate good free cash flow and ideally it was - it would be to generate pretty consistent free cash flow over multiple - or over every quarter. I would say in the second quarter what we feel really confident about is that, cash flow from operations is going to be very strong.","And we will again make appropriate level of CapEx investment that could drive the free cash flow to be slightly negative or roughly around zero or potentially even a little bit more positive, but we're going to make the capital investment be what's appropriate and let free cash flow go where it goes.","I would say, though, just to put this in perspective, the trough quarter of 2016, in terms of free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion, I believe. And so, if you compare that to whatever we end up doing for the second quarter, this will be massively better in terms of cash flow generation and of course that's an indication of, or an example of how we have structurally improved the business from a cost competitive perspective and from a cash flow perspective.","And indeed, if this does turn out to be the bottom, as Sanjay indicated is our expectation barring any sort of macro event or trade event, we would expect free cash flow to track more positively through the remainder of the fiscal year and into the - and into the next fiscal year. So this year will be actually a pretty good year in terms of free cash flow. That'll be four consecutive years of positive, significantly positive free cash flow for the company, which of course has never been done in Micron's history.","So again, ideally, we'd like to have, every quarter to be positive, that may or may not happen this quarter, but clearly, we're on the right track in terms of generating positive free cash flow for the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","We've seen a strong reacceleration in cloud and hyperscale spending, also seeing some near-term strong server builds by the Asia OEMs. And it appears that the excess DRAM channel inventories in this segment have been worked on, but wanted to get your views here. And typically the cloud spending up cycle duration is about three to four quarters. So, even in a seasonally weaker period for PCs and smartphones in the first part of next year, do you see the server and data center demand remaining fairly strong?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes. As we look ahead, we do see server and data center demand particularly within cloud to be strong. We have had, as we mentioned in our FQ1, strong growth from cloud and we certainly see that happening through 2020 as well as. As we mentioned, high-densities are actually in shortage in the industry.","And it really is about all the trend of more AI workloads, more need for memory and storage as CPUs get introduced that can work with higher density memory as well as have more channels, which is increasing the attach rate of DRAM content for server and increasing it. So these are all the trend that actually point to continuing higher than industry average level of growth for DRAMs in the cloud and server.","And same thing on the NAND, on the SSD front, average density as well as the average usage of flash in clouds and data center applications continues to increase. And we have always said, that this is the long-term demand driver for memory and storage industry. And memory and storage is critical in terms of driving greater value in these cloud applications and in these enterprise applications, and hence you are seeing continuing strong growth in these end-market segments.","And I'd just like to point out, that even in 2019, while the demand to the suppliers was weaker in the first half of the year, because the customers, particularly in this space were using up the inventory that they had to meet end consumption, but it's important to understand that the end consumption of DRAM and NAND even in challenging 2019 periods continued to be healthy.","And as we look ahead, this will be a strong driver of growth in the industry, but I just want to point out that, as we previously discussed, smartphones, content growth there, automotive applications, continuing to drive greater content, graphics, gaming consoles, new gaming consoles are also driving HDD replacement with SSDs as well as greater DRAM content in those applications.","So, I think the demand drivers and our pieces that has always been there, that the industry has strong demand drivers has very much been intact. And we look forward to good environment for our industry in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wong of Instinet. Your line is open.","David Wong","Could you tell us what proportion of DRAM bits are currently on 1Z technology? And what do you expect will be on 1Z technology by the end of calendar 2020? And what's the differences between cost per bit on 1Z compared to 1Y?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So we don't provide cost details with respect to 1Z versus 1Y or from one node to the other node. But as we have said before, that we expect our 1Y plus 1Z combined bit production to cross over our total bit production by summer of 2020. That means, bit crossover with 1Y and 1Z combined by summer of 2020.","And as we mentioned, we are doing well with our 1Z, and in fact in mobile products, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw the fastest ramp of 1Z node in the history of our mobile presence.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Joe Moore","I wanted to ask a bit more about the China inventory build that you talked about. Can you kind of talk about the reasons, is it concern about ability to procure? Is it tariff related? What's the reason for the pull-in? And anyway you can help us kind of understand the magnitude would be helpful. Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","As we have mentioned before, we saw some China buying pattern that was above normal compared to the past that we have seen. And we attribute that to some of the U.S.\/China trade tensions, and perhaps some of the customers in China procuring and shifting to, perhaps a longer-term strategy of carrying more inventory, because in terms of the U.S.\/China trade aspects, while Phase 1 deal is definitely encouraging to see, that is happening. But there is still ongoing for longer-term lack of clarity.","So perhaps, some of the China customers have shifted their strategy toward carrying higher levels of inventory. I would say that, that perhaps is an important reason. There is of course Chinese New Year as well, that can play a role in the China demand, Chinese New Year is earlier this year compared to the typical years, but there is no question that, most important thing is that the underlying demand drivers are strong.","And when you look at smartphone content growth, that's happening in all smartphones across the globe, including the ones sold by the China manufacturers, the contents both on DRAM and NAND side continues to increase, and certainly as we have talked about, 5G is - a significant driver and certainly 5G phones are planned to be sold, perhaps in largest quantities in China first. So all of these underlying demand trends, I think are the most important thing here as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your question, please.","Blayne Curtis","Maybe Sanjay, just a follow on Joe's question, I'm just kind of curious, you said it'll take couple of quarters for Huawei to get back to the numbers. Are you embedding anything in the calendar '20 outlook you have? And I'm just kind of curious, following on that point, in terms of you're expecting some moderation from China, have you seen any signs of that yet?","Sanjay Mehrotra","I'm sorry, I didn't quite get the last part of the question, expecting...","Blayne Curtis","Following on Joe's question, you're expecting some moderation after an inventory build, have you seen it yet? Or is that just something you expect will happen at some point?","Sanjay Mehrotra","What we said is that in terms of our estimation of the industry demand growth in calendar year 2020, we have baked in that some of the inventory that we may have seen in China customers build, we have baked in that some of that will be consumed and inventory levels will be lower than what we may be thinking at this point with those customers over the course of calendar year 2020.","And with respect to your first piece of the question on Huawei, we mentioned that, now that we have received the licenses, we are able to work with them on new product qualifications. And as you know well, new product qualifications do take you know a few months, couple of quarters before they get qualified into new platforms and then we can potentially look at additional opportunities, but at this point, I mean, our focus is to resume that product qualification work both for server, as well as mobile applications.","Operator","Our next question comes from Raji Gill of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Raji Gill","Yes, thanks and congrats as well as you added to this cycle. A question on mix shift for NAND, specifically, Sanjay, you had mentioned that next year, you will be ramping at a higher rate NVMe SSDs, as well as UFS controllers in the China handset market. Could you talk a little bit about the trajectory of those products and how that positive mix shift in NAND will potentially affect overall margins? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","I'll have Dave comment on the margin piece of it. But you know, certainly as we expand our portfolio of NVMe solutions for from clients to data center and of course certainly on the consumer side as well, we have done well as we reported for FQ1 in terms of expanding the portfolio and capitalizing on increased sales of SSDs. And we certainly look at gaining share throughout calendar 2020 as we expand our portfolio there.","I think what's important to note is that our share there is today under-represented. So as we shift toward these higher value solutions with expanded portfolio, I mean we are basically trying to bring our share in line with what it should be given our share of the total NAND bits. And this is the part of the strategy that we talked about in terms of shifting the mix of our high value solutions, which now are at about 50% in terms of bits toward higher number in the future.","And of course, part of that, ongoing shift is toward multi-chip packages as well as discrete managed NAND solutions for mobile applications, there we pointed out that on a year-over-year basis, we have increased our share by 50%. Yet we remain underrepresented and therein lies further opportunity for us to be increasing our share in these markets.","So, high value solutions is a very important part of our strategy. It enables us to gain greater stability, greater margin opportunity through the cycles, as well as brings us closer to understanding the application landscape with the customer. And I'm very pleased that Micron is executing quite well with respect to achieving our objective in this area.","David Zinsner","So obviously, high value solutions, the reason one - one of the major reasons for shifting the strategy to high value solutions is because they carry higher margins. I'll just give you a data point, if you look back at fiscal '19 and look at these high value solutions relative to consumer components, you'll find the margins were about 30 points - 30 percentage points higher. So significantly higher - opportunity to get higher margins and, of course, that obviously helps the overall margins of the company.","Operator","Last question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.","Hans Mosesmann","Congratulations to the team for the execution. Sanjay, on the server and data center module dynamic where you're seeing a higher mix of quality or higher density, what was the density on average a year ago, just to get a reference and how that has improved? And what exactly is driving this move? Is it a new processor architecture? Or is it market share gains? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes, in cloud servers as well as enterprise server, the average density is around 300 gigabyte per server average consumption of DRAM. And this trend is expected when you look at the CAGR over the next few years, expected to continue to grow in double digit range anywhere when you look at '19 to '22 kind of CAGR, around 20% CAGR for average content growth in servers, in cloud and enterprise applications. So this is definitely a high growth area for the market.","And when you look at the new CPUs, like Cascade Lake and other new CPUs starting in 2019, as I mentioned earlier they support the usage of higher density chips, that means the support usage of 16 gigabyte chips, as well as more channels in the new CPUs and that is definitely driving greater ability to use more content per server for DRAM.","And of course, at the end of the day, it's about the workloads that applications are running, and those workloads are requiring - increasing requirement for speed and that's translating into increasing requirement for memory as more and more real-time data analytics kind of applications and AI applications are being - applications are being done in enterprise and data center and cloud applications.","Hans Mosesmann","And as a quick follow-up. Can you give us a commentary regarding 3D XPoint used in main memory, if there is a roadmap for that this year - this coming year?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So 3D XPoint, certainly as we said, exciting opportunity for us longer term. It definitely gives us differentiated opportunity with - as the only company in the world having NAND, DRAM and 3D XPoint. We have just introduced our first storage product with 3D XPoint, the world's fastest SSD. And as you noted, I mean 3D XPoint certainly has opportunities on the memory side of the business as well.","And as we look at engaging with the ecosystem, as we look at developing our products, these are the kind of opportunities both on the memory semantic applications as well as storage side of the applications, we'll be addressing over the course of next few years as we expand our product portfolio in this area.","But certainly, 3D XPoint, - again these kind of things, breakthrough technologies take multiple years and require lot of ecosystem work to get the full use of the technology. And we are well on our way as we discussed at Micron Insight, and let me put a plug here again, that if you have not watched it, please do watch Sumit's presentation, I think it gives you a pretty good perspective on the capabilities of 3D XPoint technology and our vision of the future with it.","Operator","Thank you.

Good afternoon, everyone.","Micron executed well in the second quarter, delivering solid results and healthy levels of profitability and free cash flow, despite a challenging industry environment. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the quarter by increasing our cash position and total liquidity. Although we expect industry headwinds in the near-term, we continue to grow and diversify our product portfolio, improve our cost competitiveness and lay the foundation to emerge stronger, both financially and operationally, from this environment.","I would like to start with a review of two important pillars of Micron\u2019s strategy, improving cost competitiveness and increasing high-value solutions in our portfolio. Our strategy positions us for the tremendous opportunities ahead, while also enabling us to better navigate near-term headwinds. Strong execution against this strategy has improved our annualized profitability by over $6 billion from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018. This has improved our EBITDA margin by more than 15 percentage points relative to our competitors over the same period.","We expect further progress on cost reduction this fiscal year, including healthy year-over-year cost declines in both DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, our 1Y nanometer is yielding well, and we expect to increase conversion to 1Y nanometer in the second half of fiscal 2019. We are also making excellent progress on 1Z nanometer and have started sampling products utilizing this technology. As we have said in the past, future DRAM node transitions require additional process steps and more fab cleanroom space. Consequently, in addition to the previously announced expansion of our Hiroshima facility, we are starting site preparation for the cleanroom expansion at our Taichung facility to enable the transition of existing DRAM wafer capacity to future nodes. We are still finalizing the timing but expect production output sometime in calendar 2021.","In NAND, we achieved meaningful production on 96-layer 3D NAND in fiscal Q2 with the fastest yield ramp of any NAND product in our history. We are also making good progress on development of our fourth-generation 3D NAND, which uses our replacement gate technology. Given the high initial capital requirements of floating gate to replacement gate conversion, we expect that our first replacement gate node will provide limited cost reduction, and hence we are planning to deploy this node across select NAND products, with the rest of the portfolio converting later to the second node of replacement gate. This approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND capital investments as we convert our capacity. As a reminder, our replacement gate architecture will allow us to deliver performance improvements and provide us an efficient path toward scaling multiple future generations of 3D NAND. Given the limited initial deployment at the first node of replacement gate, we expect that our NAND bit supply growth in calendar 2020 will be below industry demand levels, and we plan to utilize our cost-effective floating gate inventory position to meet customer requirements.","Turning to high-value solutions, more than two-thirds of NAND revenues in the first half of fiscal 2019 were from high-value solutions, up from 55% in the first half of 2018. This increased mix of high-value solutions, combined with our competitive cost structure, enabled us to deliver fiscal Q2 NAND gross margin in the high 30s despite steep price declines in the industry.","In SSDs, we are making progress on transitioning to NVMe while continuing to improve our cost profile in SATA. In fiscal Q2, we began revenue shipments to a large PC OEM for our first NVMe client SSD, which features our internally designed controller, and are in active qualifications with other customers. We intend to introduce cloud and enterprise NVMe SSDs later this calendar year. In SATA, we introduced consumer and client SSDs based on 96-layer 3D NAND in fiscal Q2. In the cloud market, our custom persistent memory solution, which combines DRAM and NAND, is now fully ramped and contributed meaningfully to our cloud revenues.","3D XPoint development remains on track with customer samples planned before calendar year-end. We believe 3D XPoint technology will be a key enabler for numerous new applications, particularly artificial intelligence and data analytics. As announced previously, in January of this year we exercised our option to acquire Intel\u2019s interest in the IMFT facility in Lehi, Utah. This acquisition provides us with the manufacturing capability and highly skilled talent to drive 3D XPoint development and innovation.","Now turning to end markets. I\u2019ll start with mobile. During fiscal Q2 we grew revenues and expanded gross margins year-over-year despite adverse memory and storage pricing and weakness in high-end smartphone unit sales. Our performance in mobile was propelled by growth in our managed NAND portfolio, where NAND bit shipments grew more than 5x year-over-year. We are also seeing strong demand for our 1Y-nanometer LPDRAM due to its industry-leading capacity and best-in-class power consumption.","Memory and storage content growth in smartphones continues, driven by features such as multiple cameras, machine learning, computational photography and 4K video. Last month, Samsung announced its premium Galaxy S10 Plus smartphone, featuring 12 gigabytes of DRAM and 1 terabyte of NAND. At Mobile World Congress, several companies announced exciting new phones featuring 5G connectivity and foldable screens. These next-generation premium smartphones will typically feature 8 to 12 gigabytes of DRAM and 256 to 512 gigabytes of NAND versus 4 to 6 gigabytes of DRAM and 64 to 128 gigabytes of NAND in current-generation premium smartphones. These trends will likely cascade to lower-tier phones as well. We believe that 5G, foldable phones and upcoming innovations in augmented and virtual reality will drive sustained content growth for years to come and should reignite smartphone unit sales beginning in calendar 2020.","We are also excited by the opportunity that 5G is likely to create beyond mobile, as it will enable true machine-to-machine communication and accelerate data creation and analysis, which are fundamental drivers for our business. We expect 5G adoption to create increased demand for memory and storage in IoT devices, wireless infrastructure and data centers. Our embedded and networking businesses are already starting to see benefit from early 5G infrastructure investments.","In the data center market, the demand for memory has moderated this year following exceptional growth in the last two years. The slowdown in demand is a result of ongoing customer inventory adjustments, as well as software optimizations at some cloud customers. We expect growth to resume in the second half of calendar 2019 as we see improvement in our customers\u2019 inventory position. The new server processors that support higher memory densities are expected to be introduced in a few months, which should drive additional demand growth in the second half of calendar 2019. In fiscal Q2, we shipped high-density 1Y-nanometer DDR4 server module samples to customers ahead of plan, which will position us well to benefit from this new CPU platform ramp.","In graphics, we grew sales of our high-performance GDDR6 DRAM and expanded our customer base, which positions us for stronger growth in the second half of calendar 2019. We are seeing steep customer inventory adjustments in GDDR5 and expect them to be largely completed by the middle of this calendar year.","We had another strong quarter in automotive with year-over-year revenue growth driven by increasing demand for ADAS and advanced in-vehicle infotainment systems. In fiscal Q2, we announced several new automotive products, including a collaboration with Qualcomm for next-gen in-vehicle infotainment and 5G communications modules. We also announced a new strategic collaboration with a leading supplier of ADAS platforms using our full portfolio of memory and storage products. Lackluster automobile unit sales are a short-term challenge, however, we see the auto market generating robust growth for Micron over the next decade, as memory and storage content continues to increase in autos, driven by advanced infotainment systems and the adoption of autonomous vehicles.","In the industrial and consumer markets, we saw a decline in sales due to seasonal, macroeconomic and pricing weaknesses, as well as inventory adjustments. We had important design wins in video surveillance, point of sales and factory automation applications. At Mobile World Congress, we announced the industry\u2019s first 1 terabyte microSD card using QLC NAND.","In the PC market, sales declined more than 25% sequentially driven by weaker pricing and the inventory drawdown seen in other segments, as well as client CPU shortages. We remain focused on our cost competitiveness in this market, and over two-thirds of our PC DRAM bit shipments are now coming from our advanced 1X and 1Y-nanometer technology nodes.","Now turning to our DRAM industry outlook. Since our last earnings call, DRAM pricing weakened more than expected. Our demand outlook for calendar 2019 has moderated, led by somewhat greater levels of customer inventory, weakening server demand at several enterprise OEM customers and worse-than-expected CPU shortages. We believe macroeconomic uncertainty is also contributing to hesitation in buying behavior at some customers. However, as we discussed on our last earnings call, we still expect DRAM bit shipments to begin increasing in our fiscal Q3, with demand growth strengthening in the second half of calendar 2019 as most customer inventories are likely to normalize by mid-year.","Based on our current view, we now estimate calendar 2019 DRAM bit demand growth from our customers to be in the low-to-mid teens, with their end demand a few points above that. Further, we estimate industry supply bit growth is tracking to mid-to-high teens.","Given the lower DRAM demand outlook from our customers, we have decided to idle approximately 5% of our DRAM wafer starts. This action will bring our production levels close to our view of DRAM industry bit demand growth for calendar 2019. We will continue to monitor the market and take appropriate actions to ensure that our bit supply growth in calendar 2019 remains closely aligned with demand.","Looking beyond our fiscal 2019, we expect bit demand growth to accelerate as mobile and server demand improves. In particular, we expect robust DRAM bit demand growth in fiscal 2020, bouncing back from a weak fiscal 2019.","NAND markets remain oversupplied from the acceleration in bit growth driven by the industry transition to 64-layer 3D NAND. Although fiscal Q2 pricing came in below our expectations, we are optimistic that demand elasticity and seasonal trends will support improving demand growth in the second half of the calendar year. We expect that calendar 2019 NAND bit demand growth is likely to be in the mid-30s% range, with industry supply growing in the high-30s, and we are targeting our bit shipments to grow close to the growth rate of industry bit demand. We have been managing our NAND bit supply growth prudently, including adjusting our capital planning and wafer volumes. We are reducing our total NAND wafer starts by approximately 5%, mostly through reductions on our legacy nodes.","Given these changes in DRAM and NAND industry conditions, we have reduced our CapEx for fiscal 2019 and are evaluating our CapEx for fiscal 2020. We are taking prudent actions to address the current market conditions, while executing well on our long-term strategic objectives.","I will now turn it over to Dave to provide financial results of our fiscal second quarter and guidance for the third quarter. ","Dave Zinsner","Thanks, Sanjay.","Micron\u2019s fiscal second quarter results were within our guidance as we executed well in a period of somewhat weaker-than-expected market conditions. In the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders, continued to improve our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet through our first issuance of investment-grade debt. Most of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem a large portion of our outstanding convertible notes, reducing our fully diluted share count.","Total fiscal second quarter revenue was $5.8 billion, down 21% from the prior year and down 26% from the fiscal first quarter. Revenue reflected worse-than-expected pricing trends in DRAM and NAND.","DRAM revenue was down 28% year-over-year and 30% sequentially from the fiscal first quarter and represented 64% of total Company revenue in the fiscal Q2. DRAM ASPs declined in the low 20% range compared to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were down in the low double-digits. Year-over-year, DRAM bit shipments were down mid-single digits.","NAND revenue declined 2% year-over-year and 18% from the prior quarter. NAND revenue represented 30% of total Company revenue in the fiscal Q2. Our overall NAND ASP declined in the mid-20% range, while shipment quantities increased in the upper single-digit percent range compared to the prior quarter. NAND bit shipments came in stronger than our expectation due to timing of demand from a large customer.","Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute And Networking Business Unit was $2.4 billion, down 35% year-over-year and 34% from the prior quarter. The sequential decline was driven by pricing across major market segments, as well as volume reductions, particularly in graphics, cloud and PCs.","Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit or MBU was $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year and down 27% from the record fiscal first quarter. Lower volume due to weak seasonality and pricing contributed to the quarter-over-quarter revenue decline. Despite the current market conditions, MBU revenue grew year-over-year due to strong growth in our managed NAND products.","The Embedded Business Unit revenue of $800 million was down 4% compared to the prior year and down 14% from the record fiscal first quarter. The automotive business was only down slightly from record fiscal first quarter, despite weakness in automobile sales. Other embedded revenue declined quarter-over-quarter due to weaker pricing and lower DRAM volumes.","Finally, the Storage Business Unit fiscal second quarter revenue was $1 billion, down 19% year-over-year and down 11% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by lower SSD revenue, partially offset by increased component revenue.","The consolidated gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 50% compared to 58% in the prior year and 59% in the fiscal first quarter. Fiscal second quarter results included ongoing impact from 3D XPoint underutilization costs, which approximated 160 basis points. Pricing came in weaker than expected in both DRAM and NAND, but strong execution on cost reductions resulted in gross margins within our guidance range.","Fiscal second quarter operating expenses of $818 million came in at the high end of our guided range. OpEx included $37 million in one-time tool impairment costs that were not anticipated in our guidance. Excluding this impairment, OpEx would have come in at the low end of our guidance. We remain focused on controlling our expenses, while investing in future products and technologies.","We delivered solid profitability in the fiscal second quarter with operating income of $2.1 billion, representing 36% of revenue. This margin is down 13 percentage points year-over-year and also down 13 percentage points from the fiscal first quarter.","The tax rate for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 8.3%. And we now expect our fiscal 2019 tax rate to be approximately 10.5%.","Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal Q2 were $1.71, down from $2.82 in the year-ago quarter and down from $2.97 in the prior quarter.","Turning to cash flows and capital spending. In the fiscal second quarter, we generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations, representing 59% of revenue.","Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was approximately $2.4 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior quarter. We have lowered our CapEx target for fiscal 2019 to approximately $9 billion from our prior guidance range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, as we manage through the current environment while maintaining investment in our strategic priorities. As we mentioned before, a significant portion of our CapEx this year is going towards cleanroom construction and assembly and test operations, which do not contribute to our bit supply growth. Fab equipment spend in fiscal 2019 is down from last year and is mostly targeted towards migrating 20-nanometer DRAM and 32-layer 3D NAND to more advanced nodes, with no new wafer capacity additions. The investment in these technology transitions provides compelling cost reduction and a very attractive ROI. As we have demonstrated over the past two quarters, we remain nimble on CapEx based on business conditions.","In the fiscal second quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less net CapEx was approximately $1 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter and $2.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter. We deployed approximately 70% of the quarter\u2019s free cash flow towards our share repurchase program. We bought back approximately $700 million of stock in fiscal Q2, representing 21 million shares.","Through the first half of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 63 million shares for $2.5 billion, utilizing 76% of our free cash flow in fiscal first half. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital and remain committed to deploying at least 50% of our free cash flow on an annual basis towards repurchases under our current $10 billion authorization. In addition to the buybacks, we also eliminated our 2043 converts subsequent to the quarter close, which at current share prices effectively lowered our fully diluted share count by approximately 9 million shares. Note that the underlying share count for these converts was 35 million shares, which could have resulted in greater dilution with increases in our share price.","Inventory ended the quarter at $4.4 billion, increasing from $3.9 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Our fiscal second quarter days of inventory were 134 days compared to 107 days in the fiscal first quarter. The actions that we have announced today regarding supply reductions, combined with improving customer demand, will begin to address our higher inventory levels.","We ended the fiscal Q2 in a strong liquidity position with net cash of $3 billion and total liquidity of nearly $12 billion. Total cash increased to $9.2 billion, largely as a result of our $1.8 billion debt issuance. Our debt position increased by $2.1 billion to $6.2 billion in the quarter, primarily due to the debt offering and recognition of premium associated with the Series G convertible note redemption. Subsequent to quarter-end, we used $1.4 billion of cash to complete the convertible note redemption, which reduced our outstanding GAAP debt balance by approximately $1.1 billion.","On January 14th, we exercised our call option to acquire IMFT, our joint venture with Intel. We expect to close the transaction in either late fiscal 2019 or in the first half of fiscal 2020. This near $1.5 billion transaction will also retire the $1 billion of joint-venture-related debt on Micron\u2019s balance sheet. Since we already consolidate IMFT\u2019s results in our financial statements, we do not expect a material impact to our near-term results.","Now, turning to our market outlook. DRAM and NAND markets are working through supply and demand imbalances. Our visibility remains low and the near-term environment remains challenging. While there have been CapEx reductions across the industry, they haven\u2019t yet impacted output growth due to lead times. We expect our DRAM bit shipments to grow sequentially during the fiscal third quarter and at much higher rates in the fiscal fourth quarter. In NAND, we expect a modest sequential decline in our bit shipments in the fiscal third quarter due to timing of shipments and expect growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter. The output reductions that we announced today for DRAM and NAND, plus the $1.5 billion of CapEx reductions that we have announced year-to-date, will also help reduce our supply of DRAM and NAND in the second half of this calendar year.","With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal third quarter is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.80 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 37% to 40%; and operating expenses at approximately $785 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.85, plus or minus $0.10.","In closing, Micron continues to execute on our key initiatives, increasing our mix of high-value solutions, improving our cost profile and investing in new and innovative products. Our solid financial footing, strong liquidity and substantially reduced leverage means that we are well-positioned to invest in our future despite near-term market conditions.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Dave.","In response to near-term industry conditions, we are taking decisive action to reduce our supply growth to be consistent with industry demand. At the same time, we continue to invest and execute against our strategic priorities to reduce costs and increase the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio. The long-term demand trends for Micron remain very healthy, with tremendous growth opportunities across multiple markets. We continue to believe that the memory industry is structurally stronger with more diversified demand drivers and moderating supply growth capability. With our strong balance sheet and improved product portfolio and operating model, Micron is better positioned than ever before to win and deliver long-term value for shareholders.","We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to focus on the inventory situation. Sanjay, you talked about hyperscale inventory a couple of times, and then Dave tying up also trying to see what the balance sheet inventory would do. So, A, just update on where are we on the -- in terms of weeks of inventory? And then, for my quick follow-up, Dave, what's the flex CapEx now left that you could moderate down if the conditions were to get worse? Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Okay. So, I'll take -- first, let me talk about our inventory. So, as we noted, our inventories are now at 134 days, a couple of dynamics going on. So, in DRAM, as we talked about last quarter, we expected to carry a higher level of inventory in the first half of the calendar year as our customers that have built up inventory and start to digest through that. And then, on top of that, what we did was we reduced our CapEx. And so, the outcome of that reduction in CapEx should start to have an effect in the back of our half of our calendar year in terms of bit growth, so that will start to help manage inventory as well. And then on top of that, this quarter, we talked about further reductions in CapEx down to the approximately $9 billion. And we talked about taking some underutilization, about 5% of underutilization to kind of further reduce the output. So, that should help bring DRAM inventories back more in line. So, we would expect that back half of the calendar year we start to see DRAM be in a better place.","On the NAND front, obviously, we're at elevated levels of inventory as well. Now, that is somewhat by design, as Sanjay noted in his remarks, we do have the transition from floating gate to replacement gate in NAND going on in calendar 2020. And so, the bit output is not going to be very robust. And so, the idea was to carry higher levels of inventory into 2020 such that that would help support the end, the demand from our customers.","Having said that, we also -- part of the CapEx reduction does impact NAND as well. And also, we did adjust our wafer output by 5% and NAND as well as also try to manage inventory. So, I think that, inventory you'll start to see improve in the back half of the calendar year, and then into 2020, as we start to work through the NAND portion of the inventory.","As far as CapEx goes, really the way we're managing this is what we said, when we talked about it at the Analysts Day. We're committed to our model of low-30s as a percent of sales for CapEx. Obviously, there'll be years where that is above the average and there will be years that that will be below the average. I think, the last two years, fiscal 2017 and 2018, we were below that low-30s model. So, it's not surprising to be a bit above that low-30s level for these couple years. Plus, on top of that, we had a bit of pent-up demand to get some of the clean room space staged to be able to manage these node transitions. And so we have a number of different cleanroom buildout initiatives going on this year, which is maybe elevating a little bit from kind of our normal run rate. But, over the long term, you would see us be in this low-30s percent level. And as I think Sanjay mentioned in his remarks, I think I mentioned in my remarks, we're flexible on CapEx, we\u2019ll modulate it based on the economic circumstances.","Ambrish Srivastava","And the hyperscale?","Sanjay Mehrotra","With respect to hyperscale, as I said in my remarks that we do expect that inventory will work through the system at our customers during the first half of the year. And we certainly are seeing evidence of inventory consumption by our customers. And we do expect that that will largely be completed by mid this year. And we do expect in DRAM that growth will accelerate, both sequentially and year-over-year for the rest of the calendar year. And second half of the calendar year, with respect to demand improvement, there will be -- the demand will improve in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half of the calendar year. And, of course, effect of CPU shortages, those will continue to improve in situation over the course of the year. And we expect that also to contribute toward improvement in demand in the second half of the calendar year compared to first year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Sanjay, I guess, I just wanted a little bit more detail behind the decision to actually shutter some DRAM capacity in the current quarter. Last quarter, you talked about how a flattening cost curve actually increased the useful life of holding inventory, which seemed to make sense to me. This seems to be a little bit of a reversion from that. And just given that you're not a big enough piece of the DRAM market to I think impact overall supply-demand, it really kind of depends upon what the guys in Korea are doing. I'm just kind of curious as to why you came to this decision to shutter some capacity.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, I think, as Dave had previously mentioned in one of the earning calls, that about 150 days of inventory is something that we are comfortable with. And when we really look at our demand at this time and look at our production output, we think it is important for us to bring our supply to be in line with the expected demand for the year. And it provides us obvious benefits in terms of managing our inventories more effectively, managing our cash flow effectively as well and really managing our business in a healthy fashion. Of course, our inventory is at good cost, there is no obsolescence issue with this inventory at all. But, we really consider it prudent management of our business to bring our supply growth in line with our demand expectations.","Dave Zinsner","And I\u2019d just add -- the underutilization costs that will incur are not going to help layer into our cost per unit. So, they will be taken as period costs within the quarter and it's implied in our 37% to 40% gross margin guidance for the third fiscal quarter. Sorry to interrupt, John.","John Pitzer","So, Sanjay, you explained why in fiscal 2020 you\u2019ll under grow the industry in NAND bits as you move to fourth generation. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what the cost implication of that is. Will your cost curve in NAND be negatively impacted or should you be able to benefit in 2020 from continued mix towards 96-layer on the technology side and just product mix to more managed NAND? How do we think about cost in fiscal year 2020?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Our cost position will be good in fiscal year 2020 because today with our both 64-layer as well as 96-layer technologies, we absolutely have been outperforming the industry in terms of our at the die level the costs on a per gigabyte basis. And that -- and obviously, as you know, we have discussed this many times in the past, those benefits come from CMOS under array architecture which Micron has pioneered and we currently are in our third generation using that. So that gives us a very significant cost advantage and that will carry over well, giving us competitive mix of NAND production in 2020 in our fiscal year 2020 to meet the market demands. And keep in mind, the fourth generation of our 3D NAND which will be the first node in replacement gate technology, even with greater number of layers will actually have greater capital intensity associated with it because of transition from floating gate to replacement gate that requires more tools, more specific unique tools to implement replacement gate. And that's why we are really converting portion of our portfolio to that first generation replacement gate technology. And remainder of the portfolio will convert from the third generation floating gate to the second node of replacement gate later on. And obviously that will provide us a bigger benefit when we do that. The second node of replacement gate with yet higher layers later compared to the first node. So, that will give us a benefit of cost as well as ROI and it will really be the best way to manage this transition for us.","So, in summary, even with increasing the number of layers in the third -- first generation of replacement gate, we feel very good about the cost competitiveness with the mix of floating gate and replacement gate technologies that we will be achieving next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your question please?","C.J. Muse","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, a two-part question. You used the word idling regarding 5% for DRAM and then reducing your NAND, wafer starts by 5%. I guess, two questions to that. Are you trying to send us a different signal in terms of what you're doing for both? And then, could you provide a little clarity on how we should think about the impact to your cost structure, as you slow down wafers? And then, when you start to turn back on, how we should think about the impact? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, bottom-line is we are reducing our output of DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, the reduction in supply growth, as a result of this idling capacity, idling wafer starts, is bigger impact. And in NAND, as we reduce our wafer starts, particularly related to the legacy nodes, the impact on the supply bit growth is smaller because that wafer start reduction that you mentioned is primarily targeted toward legacy nodes.","So, again, the objective of these is to bring down our supply growth toward our estimations of demand, both in DRAM and NAND from the point of view of 2019 as well as 2020 timeframe. And with respect to cost, as I said before, we have continued to outperform in terms of cost reduction -- year-over-year cost reduction capability in DRAM. And we feel very good about our ability to manage with this slowdown in DRAM, managing a competitive fashion with our cost over the course of next few quarters. And in NAND, I just commented on our cost position there. And I'll just add to the previous comments on the cost position that of course next year, we will also continue to get the benefit of our 96-layer transition from 64-layer to 96-layer, the ongoing transition during the course of next year, which will also be helping us with cost.","So, I believe our cost in DRAM as well as NAND will be competitive. And I just want to point out that the benefits of deduction, output deduction go beyond just aspects of cost. They of course -- those benefits include inventory management and cash flow management.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thank you for letting me ask the question here. So, back to a question on inventory. So, when you first started seeing your customer demand inventory related weakness, it always takes time for the actual supply growth output of your manufacturing infrastructure to kind of trend towards your target. So, initially, you augment that manufacturing ramp down with some inventory accumulation. It appears that you executed to that in fiscal Q2. But, now that you're moderating output lower again, again, that's going to appear that it's going to take some more time. So, do you anticipate inventories actually moving higher here in the May quarter, before it starts to down shift in the back half of the calendar year?","Dave Zinsner","Yes. I think, inventory might be a little bit elevated in the May quarter relative to where we are today. Obviously, as you point out, it does take some time, most of the CapEx reductions we took him took in the first fiscal quarter. So, those take a couple of quarters, but we should start experiencing that in the back half of the calendar year. And the underutilization, you get probably a quarter before it starts impacting you.","So, I think, we\u2019ll be in pretty good shape on DRAM, as I said, as we kind of exit the calendar year. NAND will take a little bit longer because of the reasons we cited about keeping elevated levels of inventory into 2020.","Harlan Sur","Great. And then, my follow-up question, much of -- Sanjay, much of your industry outlook is based off of a view of second half improvements in virtually all of your target markets, PC, client cloud, mobile, et cetera. Given the value chain and lead time, should we anticipate that your customer second half recovery should start to drive an inflection in your NAND and DRAM business in fiscal Q4?","Sanjay Mehrotra","We are not providing fiscal Q4 guidance here. But, as we have said that second half of this calendar year, we do expect that bit growth in DRAM to continue on a quarter-over-quarter basis, both sequentially as well as on a year-over-year basis. And that is already, we are guiding to bit growth in DRAM for our FQ3, and that should continue in FQ4 and for the rest of the year as well. And in NAND, there is of course the seasonality in the second half of the calendar year. And of course, we expect effect of elasticity also to help improve the demand.","And the trend of increasing average capacities in smartphones both for DRAM and NAND continues to be intact. When you look at the results that some of the cloud service providers have reported, those results continue to be solid, pointing to the demand and the growth in cloud services. And of course, memory and storage is an essential part of all the computing paradigms of the future that are increasingly being based on AI and ML as well. All of that bodes well for the long-term demand trends as well. But, yes, I mean, we do -- in all of our end markets, we do see a generally improvement in demand in the second half versus the first half. And of course, all of this is barring macroeconomic uncertainty. In case that there is any further determination in microeconomic climate, then we can have different impact in this outlook. But, that's what -- based on what we know today, that's our assessment of demand expectations.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open. ","Timothy Arcuri","Sanjay, I wanted to go back just to question that got asked before. So, in DRAM, you are still well above cash costs, yet you're idling capacity. So, obviously demand is a lot worse than you expected. But, you sound pretty optimistic that it's going to come back in the back half of the year. So, why would you reduce starts now if you\u2019re so optimistic about demand coming back in the back half of the year? I get that it has to do with inventory. But, I'm just trying to reconcile those two comments, because it seems like you're leaving money on the table. Thanks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, demand has been weak so far this year and we expect demand environment to be weak in the first half as well. So, when we talk about our total DRAM demand growth expectations, we are talking about the full year basis, right? So, we need to be -- and when you look at our supply growth, of course, we are looking at that too, on a full year basis. So, we want to bring our supply in line with our demands expectations, and we believe that this improving demand environment second half versus first half that I referred to earlier, we will be able to capture the benefit of that with our supply cutback that we have mentioned and also help bring our all time continue to drive improvement in our inventory position as well.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up, Dave. I just wanted to go back to the question on costs. You've been bringing DRAM costs down kind of like low to mid-teens year-over-year and NAND has been kind of in the mid-20s year-over-year. So, it seems like some of these actions have to ultimately impact your abilities of cost down vis-\u00e0-vis that level? Is -- am I missing something there, because it sounds like you're saying that there's no impact? So, can you just again reconcile those for me? Thanks.","Dave Zinsner","We do expect healthy cost declines in both DRAM and NAND this year. We are still making technology transitions next year. And so, we would obviously expect, particularly in DRAN the cost will be good. As we said, replacement gate might not be where we want it to be in the very first generation. But one of the advantages of carrying the inventory we're carrying, 64-layer and 96-layer inventory in the next year is that has a very good cost structure. And so, we should have a good cost structure in 2020 on NAND as well.","The other thing on utilization, I just want to make sure it's clear. What period cost means is, we'll take that expense kind of as it comes in the in the quarters in which we take the underutilization. It won't roll up in the inventory; it won't be counted as part of the cost. So, obviously, we'll have an impact on margins. And as I said, it's implied in the guidance of the margins we gave for the fiscal third quarter.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And on NAND, I just wanted to point out again that, 96-layer is still early in our production ramp, and it will continue to ramp during the course of next year as we bring out our first node of replacement gate. So, 96-layer will also continue to be a strong driver of our cost reduction capability in 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Karl Ackerman","Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to just kind of go back to bit growth. I understand that idling your wafer starts slows your bit supply. But, do you expect any shifts in your portfolio mix toward certain end markets or shifts toward new technology nodes that should impact your second half bit supply?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, obviously, we pay a lot of attention to this in terms of managing the mix of our production. We do that on an ongoing basis anyhow in production. And, when we implement this output cut, both in NAND as well as DRAM, obviously we make sure that we are not impacting any aspect of our ability to fulfill our demand. So, as we said, I mean, we have high levels of inventory currently, both in NAND and DRAM. And it gives us an opportunity to bring our production to be in line with demand. And when we say that we mean that we will be able to address the demand in all of our end markets. We are not going to compromise our production cuts so that we run low in terms of meeting our customers' requirements in any of the end market segments. So, we believe this is a very prudent way for us to manage our business.","Karl Ackerman","I appreciate that. I guess, perhaps a clarification on that question, then. The [indiscernible] would say that NAND demand elasticity has not yet kicked in. So, could you just perhaps shed some light on design wins, maybe not just in NAND but also in DRAM that you've seen across your product portfolio that would anchor your view of a second half recovery? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","With respect to NAND elasticity, I mean, certainly the average capacities in notebook, PCs, as well as the attach rates of SSDs to notebooks, does continue to go up. So, that is of course a price elastic market as well. And the price -- attractive price points of NAND, of course provide benefits of greater HDD replacement both in the data center market as well as in the client market. Mobile definitely continues to be pointing to elasticity with respect to NAND. At Mobile World Congress, you saw smartphones, foldable phones and 5G phones being announced with 512-gigabyte and terabyte of storage capacities in them. And again, applications are also advancing toward features that require more and more storage, for example, 5G with greater connectivity as well as low latency will of course, these driving applications that you need more, DRAM as well as more NAND.","So applications -- end market applications continue to do very well, And Micron itself with respect to our product portfolio, we are very much focused on continuing to expand our product offerings and we have also -- on the SSD side, we are expanding our portfolio with NVMe solutions. We have just brought our first NVMe client drive into the market; and later this year, we will have NVMe for enterprise and cloud applications as well. So, this is -- and we announced that we got a qualification win and just begun shipment to a customer with our NVMe -- first generation NVMe client side as well. So, these are all the things that we are absolutely focused on in terms of our roadmap to expanding our opportunities. And of course, we have made lot of improvement with respect to some of these solutions over the course of last couple of years. And there is a lot of execution that is remaining ahead of us with respect to expanding our SSD opportunities, for example, as well as growing our mobile opportunities on the NAND side where we have gained meaningful share over the course of last few quarters. But, there is a lot more opportunity and a lot more roadmap execution that is required for us here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","Hey, guys. Thanks for my taking question. I was curious on the customer timing if you can elaborate. Was that just the timing between quarters or was that more of a strategic by that was multi-quarters in nature? And then, I was just curious if you can elaborate on the data center you set back in the second half, but it seems like you're not seeing a pickup in orders yet, and kind of what gives you confidence that you're going to see that start in Q3?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So, with respect to timing of demand in the second quarter that was -- as you mentioned, it was a large customers timing of specific fulfillment of their demand. And that's what -- and that was related to NAND. And with respect to the second part of your question, as I said before, that we do see evidence of inventory consumption by our customers and that gives us confidence that this inventory will largely work itself through the system in the first half with improvements in demand in the second half. And, we have also certainly in recent weeks seen some new orders from certain customers that previously had high inventories. Of course, too soon to use this as any kind of a slope in terms of demand buildup from here on. But, bottom-line is that ultimately the end market demand drivers continue to be strong. If the consumption of DRAM by our customers in the end markets, particularly cloud market continues to be healthy, it\u2019s just that those customers are using up their inventory to meet that demand. And over the course of next few months, by mid this year, that inventory will be returning to normalized levels to a large extent, and then that will provide for opportunities for a greater demand in the second half of the year compared to the first half.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. I'm just curious on the inventory side for the May quarter [technical difficulty]. To the extent that you built 27 days of inventory this last quarter, a fair amount of your introduction went on to the balance sheet. [Technical difficulty]. Thanks. ","Dave Zinsner","We\u2019ve got a little -- most of that, but okay, let take a crack at that, Joe. There was some background noise. So, yes, as you cite, inventories were up. We do expect DRAM to grow sequentially in the third fiscal quarter. That combined with -- are starting to see some benefit. [Technical difficulty] Those should be a combination of the reduction in utilization and the CapEx activities, or CapEx reductions that we've already put in place, will start to adjust a bit output grow. So, we\u2019d start to see some benefit from that in the fiscal third quarter. As I said, we do expect inventories to be up again next quarter. But then, as Sanjay cited, a lot of the customers that have built up inventory will start to be back to normal. And they'll start to place heavier orders on us again, in the third and fourth calendar year, we'll start to see these reductions in a DRAM inventory levels.","Operator","And that does conclude the Q&A session and this call.

Mark?","D. Mark Durcan","Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to begin my comments today with a few thoughts on restructuring of our joint development relationship and joint manufacturing relationship with Intel before commenting briefly on market conditions, and then looping back to highlight some of the technology and business unit accomplishments during this quarter.","So first of all, Micron's partnership with Intel on NAND Flash is, of course, a very important relationship for us as well as a significant piece of our business. As many of you are aware, we reached definitive agreements this quarter to restructure or rejuvenate that partnership. And as part of that process, we agreed to purchase Intel's share of the output from the jointly-owned NAND operations in both Manassas, Virginia, and IMFS Singapore. ","The purchase capacity was roughly 30,000 wafers per month, and Micron will sell a portion of those wafers back to Intel under a for-profit take-or-pay supply agreement. The incremental profit, along with -- the incremental profit capacity, along with the completion of the initial ramp of the new fab in Singapore, will lead to structural margin improvement going forward. ","The life of the remaining joint venture facility, which is in Lehigh, Utah, was extended to 2024. And the scope of our technology relationship was expanded to include certain memory technologies beyond the floating gate and NAND products we had historically been working on together. So I think in summary, both partners consider the relationship to date highly successful and were both very excited to be carrying this relationship on in the future.","On the technology development front, we had a strong quarter. We were excited to complete the construction of the new addition to our R&D cleanroom in Boise, Idaho, and begin installing tools there to support our leading-edge NAND, DRAM, NOR and phase-change memory nodes as well as a number of interesting, new emerging memory technologies. We made good progress on our next 2 NAND technology nodes in the development fab, and our -- as well as our 20-nanometer DRAM node. We also made progress scaling up to 300-millimeter substrates on our 45-nanometer NOR process and in developing a new 300-millimeter phase-change memory process. Moving forward, we look to deploy both of these new 300-millimeter NOR and phase-change processes in the manufacturing fabs over the next year.","In manufacturing, we had a nice quarter relative to production ramp and yield execution. I'm sure Ron will comment in more detail shortly, but a couple of highlights to note are the completion of the ramp to roughly 70,000 wafers per month of IMFS in Singapore and the 30-nanometer DRAM node introduction and successful early ramp at Inotera. We also had good early yield learning -- sorry, we also had good early 30-nanometer yield out of the DRAM fab in Singapore. So in aggregate, we now have successful transfer of that 30-nanometer node into all Micron DRAM fabs.  Additionally, it's worth noting that we can now ship 20-nanometer NAND out of all 3 Micron NAND fabs, the 2 wholly owned ones as well as the joint fab in Lehigh. Overall, we had strong bit growth and cost reduction in both NAND in DRAM during the quarter. ","Switching now briefly to markets and our products. The second quarter was obviously a weaker environment for pricing than we would have liked. Mark Adams, I think, will likely comment more in Q&A, but seasonal factors, combined with supply chain disruptions due to the Thailand flooding, as well as, I think, general slower economic activity all had an impact. ","Recently, we're seeing improvements in the DRAM market. And while we don't predict what's going to happen going forward, depending on application, I think concerns over supply seem to be having a positive or at least stabilizing effect on OEM pricing. ","For NAND, the mix of high-density 2- and 3-bit-per-cell as well as seasonal demand weakness drove our ASPs lower during the quarter. While we were able to offset most or all of this with cost reductions, we did suffer some degradation of NAND margins due to sell-through of Mnemonics legacy NAND products, which had been purchased in the market at market prices. Overall, we see generally healthy supply and demand outlook for NAND moving forward as measured by -- as measured industry fab ramps are offset by anticipated demand growth in a number of key markets like smartphones, tablets and SSDs. ","Wireless NOR, on the other hand, volumes continue to decline in the wireless space with the transition from feature to smartphones. Embedded NOR, however, remained strong, and we see long-term attractive margins and share gain opportunities in that space.","In the product area, highlights for the quarter include continued success with Hybrid Memory Cube enablement and design and activities across high-performance computing, including high-end server applications as well as across networking; good success with all 3 design wins across a number of different networking companies; strong design and activity of embedded NOR in both automotive and amusement markets. Additionally, relative to NOR, we're now shipping the industry's broadest portfolio of SPI NOR products. ","We saw good growth in mobile DRAM bit shipments, in roughly 20% range, and we're seeing early signs of design and acceleration given some of the challenges some of our competitors are facing.","Finally, in NAND during the quarter, we shipped [indiscernible] samples of our 3-bit-per-cell, 20-nanometer, 128-gigabit NAND Flash to enabling controller vendors; we shipped over 0.5 million solid-state drives; and finally, we were prominently endorsed by both EMC as a preferred partner for PCI SSDs and our VFCache product, as well as by Dell for their PowerEdge servers with the Express Flash PCIe SSDs.","In reference to consolidation, I think I'll just close by trying to preempt some of the questions. And noting that as usual, we don't comment on rumors and speculation in the press, as we've said consistently in the past, we'll be evaluating market situations as they develop and look for opportunities to strengthen Micron's competitive position. ","So with that, let me turn it over to Ron.","Ronald C. Foster","Thanks, Mark. The company's second quarter of fiscal 2012 ended on March 1. And as usual, we provided a schedule containing certain key results for the quarter as well as certain guidance for the next quarter. The materials presented on a few slides that follow is as well also on our website. ","The second quarter results posted a net loss of $224 million, or $0.23 per share, on net sales of $2,067,000,000. Total sales in the second quarter relatively flat compared to the prior quarter, reflecting slightly higher NAND and DRAM sales that were more than offset by the lower sales of NOR products, as Mark mentioned. Demand for wireless NOR products continue to be impacted by seasonal weakness, lower performance of certain customers where we have greater concentration and continued transition of certain applications to NAND devices.","Consolidated gross margin for the second quarter declined from 14.6% to 13% compared to the first quarter. ","Before getting into specific results for the quarter, I want to expand a bit on Mark's comments regarding the IM Flash arrangement we announced recently with Intel. As a result of the contemplated transactions, Micron will purchase Intel's 18% ownership interest in the IM Flash operation in Singapore. In addition, Micron will purchase from the IM Flash entity its production assets in the Micron fab in Virginia, and the associated lease of a portion of that facility will be terminated. ","Total consideration for Micron's purchases is expected to be approximately $600 million. The exact amount may vary up to the time of closing, but approximates the book value of our net assets.","In accordance with the terms of our new supply agreement, Intel has agreed to make a deposit with Micron of $300 million, which may be refunded or applied to Intel's future purchases under the agreement.","In the third quarter, results are expected to include a loss of approximately $20 million associated with the termination of the Virginia lease.","The existing relationship and supply arrangement through IMFT will remain intact, although consisting solely of the output from the Lehigh operation. Sales under this arrangement will continue to be based on relative ownership using long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. In addition to this supply agreement, Micron and Intel will enter into new agreements, where Micron will supply Intel NAND Flash products, as well as certain emerging memory technology products in the future. Sales under these new arrangements will be included in Micron's consolidated results as trade NAND sales. Micron and Intel will continue to participate in the development of NAND Flash memory technologies and will fund these shared costs equally. ","Depending on the timing of the closing of the transactions, we anticipate IM Flash sales to Intel will be approximately the same level in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. After that, we expect to see an increase in the percentage of Micron NAND revenue sold at trade pricing. ","Now let's walk through a few of the details for the second quarter. Our Singapore IM Flash fab continued to deliver on its manufacturing ramp, as Mark indicated, achieving the targeted output level for its original ramp. This represented a 30% increase in wafer production in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. While Micron's ownership of the Singapore operation is currently 82%, during the second quarter, we took 78% of that facility's production output in accordance with the existing agreements. The output from the IM Flash U.S. operations remains consistent with a 51-49 ownership split.","The equity and income or loss from equity method investees\u2019 line consists primarily of our share of Inotera's net loss for the period, as you can see on the P&L. Although the net loss for these investments was roughly the same quarter-to-quarter, improved Inotera performance resulting from higher yields and improved manufacturing efficiencies was partially offset by our share of losses from write-offs of certain deferred tax assets in 2 of our equity investments reported in that line.","Early in March, after the end of our second fiscal quarter, Micron completed the equity investment in Inotera of $170 million, and the $133 million short-term loan made to Inotera earlier in the quarter was repaid. This investment enables Inotera to initiate its conversion to Micron's 30-nanometer process technology. The initial phase of the conversion is targeted for roughly 1\/3 of Inotera's production capacity, with Micron taking a greater share of this 30-nanometer output as a result of our equity injection.","Trade NAND bit sales to Micron customers grew 36% in the second quarter, primarily as a result of a higher level of production from IM Flash Singapore quarter-over-quarter as that operation performed at its targeted level for substantially all of the second quarter. Our volume mix of MLC versus SLC NAND in the second quarter was consistent with the first quarter. Production costs per bit for trade NAND products decreased 18% in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the higher production volumes on advanced technology nodes in the period.  ","Margins on trade NAND products decreased slightly in the second quarter. However, selling prices declined more than cost -- the cost reductions. Quarter to date for the third quarter, selling prices for trade NAND products are down mid-20s compared to the average for the second quarter.","DRAM revenues have been fairly flat for the last 2 quarters as higher bit sales have been offset by decreases in selling prices across both periods. Specifically, in the second quarter, per-bit DRAM selling prices decreased 16% compared to the first quarter. This decrease was impacted by both market price declines and a somewhat lower mix of specialty products sold in the premium markets in the quarter. DRAM bit production and bit costs in the third quarter are expected to be down a couple of percent as we shift mix to maximize margins. Quarter to date for the third quarter, selling prices are relatively flat compared to the second quarter average.","Sales of SSDs, including NAND components sold to fabless SSD manufacturers, grew about 15% quarter-to-quarter as these devices continue to gain acceptance in the marketplace.","Our Wireless Solutions Group continues to be impacted by weakness in the wireless NOR market in conjunction with weakness we are experiencing with our customer concentration. We are working to adjust the customer and product mix in this space to drive future growth.","As I mentioned last quarter, we reduced production in our 200 millimeter NOR fabs. Although charges for idle capacity were lower compared to the previous quarter, they were still about $40 million in the second quarter and primarily impacted our Embedded Solutions Group and Wireless Solutions Group operating results.","SG&A expense in the second quarter increased and was approximately $20 million above our guidance range for the quarter, primarily as a result of a couple of onetime charges, including the accelerated stock vesting and benefits in the quarter and the expense associated with a committed contribution to a university. SG&A expense for the third quarter is anticipated to be between $155 million and $165 million. ","At the end of the second quarter, we capitalized and began depreciating the new R&D fab at our Boise campus. R&D expense is expected to trend slightly lower for the remainder of the fiscal year.  ","You may have noticed from the financial results summary slide presented earlier that we had a larger-than-usual gain in other nonoperating income. This primarily related to minority equity investments in several technology companies that were sold to other parties and resulted in a gain.","The company generated $574 million in cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter and generated a free cash flow of $145 million. The cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion. During the second quarter, we entered into equipment financing arrangements that brought in $230 million in financing cash flows.  ","Expenditures for property plant and equipment were $429 million for the second quarter. We continue to see total expenditures for PP&E for the fiscal year approximating $2 billion, with the largest portion having been incurred already in the first quarter.","With that, I'll close and turn it back to Kipp","Kipp A. Bedard","Thank you, Ron. We will now take questions from callers [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On your supply agreement with Intel, can you tell us how long the supply agreement lasts for? And is it for fixed wafer prices? Or do the prices move with market NAND prices?","Ronald C. Foster","This is Ron, David. The supply agreement with Intel is set up so that it's a fixed amount of volume. And we have a profit margin built into the agreement, and it's set up to extend for a number of years into the total agreement period.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Gujavarty of Deutsche Banks.","Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I mean, I was actually pretty impressed you were able -- the inventories didn't go up. You were able to move a lot of bits in a somewhat muted demand environment. Can you talk about what helped you do that? Was it your branded products? Was it share gains? Was it perhaps the Alpeta bankruptcy? Just curious around that.","Mark W. Adams","Bob, it's Mark Adams. I think the -- you've listed a couple of key contributors to that end result on inventory. Certainly, we saw a mild recovery in the PC business against expectations going into the post-holiday quarter as the hard drive industry started to recover and that\u2019s helped us on some stronger DRAM pricing coming out of the quarter, like desktop notebook commodity. SSDs continue to be a positive bright spot for us in terms of bit shipments through the quarter. We had growth there. And we continue to find growth opportunities around server bits. Our server bit shipments were another record, the second consecutive quarter we had a record in bit shipments to servers. So combined, there's been some good application segment performance for us.","Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And just a quick follow-up, I mean, if I could, on the server comment. Do you think there's an opportunity to up-sell your server DRAM product mix based on the Romley [ph] platform? My understanding is probably a little bit of a maybe perhaps a little bit more low power. Just curious if that'll help your server mix.","Mark W. Adams","Yes, I think it will. I think that's in front of us, too. I don't think that's happening today. I think the Romley adaptation is probably -- if you went back into the back half of last year, they -- you would have thought there'd be more market penetration around it. But I think it will, and it's in front of us and they'll benefit us in the future quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","My question is on the quarter to date DRAM pricing. You are guiding to flat quarter to date, and you have seen recent upward movement in the contract pricing on the DRAM side. So could you help us understand that?","Mark W. Adams","Sure. The phenomenon really occurs when the market does churn pricing. Some of the premium specialty markets we're in lagged that effect, so they may, in fact, have lower pricing while the commodity desktop-notebook actually trend back up. And that's where we are seeing improvement, in the desktop-notebook commodity segment. And our specialty markets are lagging in improvement and in turnaround. So that's where it comes out about flat, all kind of around the mix equation.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Sure, helpful. Another question, on the Embedded group. I -- there's a slide here that's showing that operating income from that group was lower compared to last quarter. Could you just help us understand that as well?","Mark W. Adams","Could you repeat the question? I'm sorry, I...","Unknown Executive","Embedded profit was lower.","Mark W. Adams","Embedded profits? Yes...","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, Embedded profit.","Mark W. Adams","Yes, sure. I'm sorry, but that -- the -- Mark Durcan commented earlier on -- that the wireless NOR market is probably more accelerating in its decline in demand. I think that put more NOR inventory in the market and then hit some of the pricing that gave us a mild erosion on the Embedded profitability. And we had to react to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Can you comment? What type of consideration does the company take in terms of potentially looking at consolidation in the industry? What actions would you take? What things would you do financially? So just give a little more clarity what the decision making behind it if you decide to pursue that opportunity.","D. Mark Durcan","Well, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to give you a whole lot of clarity on this, but, obviously, there are a lot of things that go into the mix when you look at consolidation opportunities, and you have to look at all of them in aggregate in order to make a decision as to whether something is going to be beneficial to Micron or its shareholders or not. Some of the things that we look at, obviously, are: What's the potential price of the assets you're looking at? What do you get beyond just physical assets in terms of intellectual property or technology? What is the form of consideration you might be contemplating? How does it change the competitive landscape relative to product portfolio? Clearly, we always can get -- well, not always, but we typically consider that we'll have scale efficiencies not only at the manufacturing level but also at the operating expense, R&D, SG&A. So scale has virtue in our business. All of those things kind of go in the hopper as well as probably a number that I didn't think of off the top of my head, but we look at all of those.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, and a follow-up on the SSD side. I mean, up 15% this quarter. I mean, should we expect similar growth rates in the next few quarters? I mean, how should we be looking at the SSD mix?","Mark W. Adams","Yes, I think I probably ought to speak to dynamic here, that if you go back into our last quarter, we saw a fair amount of OEM pull and channel pull ahead of -- in the last quarter due to the lack of hard drive availability. And what we saw after that was that the sell-through of that pull-through wasn't as much as the OEMs and the channel anticipated. So I would characterize it as a slightly decelerating growth as they -- as we work through the inventory. I think this is a short-term phenomenon, and I think you'll see our SSDs continue to grow. And I think maybe another quarter of right around this level is reasonable. But I think it's just a work-through out of the, I guess, the overexcitement around the preholiday SSDs given the hard drive issue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about the DRAM supply situation in the market right now. How many of your competitors do you think have latent DRAM capacity which still has yet to come online given the tough environment we're seeing out there? And maybe you can estimate that as a fraction of industry revenues and whether you see any of that supply coming back to the market.","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, well, I think there is some supply off-line. I'd put it in the 5% to 10% range currently. And with the recent uptick in pricing, I think you would normally see some of that coming back online, but you've got to balance that against, obviously, the situation that some of our competitors find themselves in of -- relative to cash availability. And so I think we're at a reasonably stable point currently with maybe a small amount of capacity coming back online in some of the Taiwanese manufacturers.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then looking out into next year, there seems to be a little controversy in terms of the NAND market and what the expectations for NAND bits -- bit growth in the industry will be, some people calling for as high as 70%, others calling for more like 50%. I was wondering if you could maybe weigh in on where you see that bit growth coming in for next year and what factors are going to drive that either higher or lower.","D. Mark Durcan","Sure. Our internal modeling is in the sort of 65% to 70% range. But there's -- obviously, there\u2019s some guardrails around that. We don't have complete accuracy or precision relative to our information. What can drive that up and down, obviously, is mix of 3-level cell versus 2-level cell versus single-level cell. So product mix going to the market can have a significant impact on bit growth without necessarily having a significant impact on profitability or cost per wafer. We have seen some level of new capacity come -- certainly planning to come into the market, and we've seen that be what I would characterize as relatively measured and, in some cases, muted relative to initial plans. And so I think what we anticipate is something in the 65% to 70% range. And if the market's stronger, maybe it'll be a little bit higher. And if the market's weaker, maybe it'll be a little bit lower.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just to confirm that, it's a 2013 estimate, right?","D. Mark Durcan","This is 2012.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Oh, yes, I was asking about 2013, sorry.","D. Mark Durcan","Oh, I'm sorry. 2013, obviously, less visibility. And from a technology migration perspective, we would expect it to be slower as opposed to -- as compared to 2012. So less from technology migrations. However, there is capacity coming online, and I don't have that figure exactly in front of me. So I would say it's probably in a similar range, actually, when you bake it all together.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","I was wondering if you could share with us what your sequential production did in fiscal Q2?","Kipp A. Bedard","We had a -- as Mark commented in his opening remarks, Shawn, the operations all executed quite well. So in all the categories that we gave guidance for last quarter, we beat them all.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","But what did they do sequentially? I mean, your shipments were up 21%, for example, in DRAM. What -- there's -- is that how much production was also up?","Kipp A. Bedard","Pretty close, yes. We're -- we beat that. We guided mid to high teens. Last quarter, we beat that by a little bit.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. Same thing on the NAND side?","Kipp A. Bedard","Correct.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then in terms of the production outlook going into fiscal Q3, can you walk us through why exactly it's going to be flat again? And maybe, can you share with us what you expect the trajectory to be in some of the later quarters?","Kipp A. Bedard","Yes, one of the things you're seeing a lot of now how the mix -- your -- you hear us talk a lot about mix in terms of ASP and cost. And it also impacts our guidance on a quarterly basis for production bit growth. And here's an example where, as Mark Adams previously noted, we see a growing opportunity in servers. The bits for those wafers tend to be lower. And so as a result, when you're moving production more in that direction, then you can -- you'll slow some of the just quarter-to-quarter comparisons on production bit growth. So we do see opportunities in the specialty area. We're moving wafers there to respond to the market. And now there's -- those aren't always your most efficient bit wafers in markets like that. Anything to that?","D. Mark Durcan","No, I think that's a good characterization of what's going on, Kipp, is mix more and more drives what the bit growth is going to be on -- in any given quarter.  In terms of just an overall \"What are we looking at for the next couple of quarters for DRAM,\" as we noted, next quarter flattish and in that same range, probably more later in the year. On NAND, I think I'd say 15%, plus or minus, and lumpy going forward.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then if I could really quickly on -- one more on the NAND. The NAND pricing, at least when I  compare it to some of the contract and spot calculations we make here, is -- your pricing seems to be a little bit worse, both in the reported quarter and for your guidance going to fiscal Q3. Is that also a mix effect? Or is there something else happening there?","Mark W. Adams","Yes, that's right. I think that it's a mix effect going to less value-add segments during the quarter.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","I'm sorry, less value-added segments?","Mark W. Adams","Yes. Our pricing -- your comment was our pricing declines looked larger than other data points you were looking at?","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Yes.","Mark W. Adams","So as we commented on the SSD situation, we're working our way out of that. You'll see our -- put our bits into more of the -- a retail-oriented commodity card USB business, those types.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Oh, I see. And how much was Intel for you in the quarter for NAND?","Kipp A. Bedard","$255 million.","D. Mark Durcan","Same level as last quarter. So let me just add on this, this mix issue. To the extent you see significant ASP declines that are toggled [ph] by mix, I mean, you also are seeing some pretty significant cost declines in those same products.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Could you give us an update just on where we stand in terms of memory inventories that are out there? And should we expect anything unusual as we approach the launch of Windows 8?","Mark W. Adams","You know what? Except for what we identified in SSDs, I think overall, things are in pretty good balance. On the DRAM front, based on some of the dynamics going on with competition, it seems that DRAM is in a pretty healthy place, pretty moderate inventory. Our OEMs have come back with pretty strong upside demand signals for us in the -- in Q3. The dynamic in the spot market's a little bit different because we expect some of the smaller players liquidating for cash flow purposes. But in general, the market inventory situation is pretty good on DRAM. And in NAND, as I described in an earlier comment, I think the inventory situations needed just to work through this quarter on selling through SSD inventory that we have carried forward, and I think that is a short-term phenomenon. And I think overall, when we look at tablet growth and smartphones and SSDs combined, I think we're bullish out in the midterm and the longer term.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just to follow up on your comment that you're seeing upside demand from the -- I guess from the PC side of the house. As -- and should we be therefore -- I mean, normally, Q2 is a seasonally down quarter for PC. But obviously, we've got hard drive issues that are still at play here. Is it predominantly the hard drive situation continuing to ease that's driving that upside demand? Or do you -- is there something else going on in PC side so you need to get [indiscernible]?","Mark W. Adams","I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is just as we're talking about maybe some negative impact on the SSD side, we think that because the -- primarily the corporate sector held off on PC procurements given the higher price SSD systems in the fall, we think there's some strength in the PC market out towards the next quarter or so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Stern Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","On the DRAM side, I know you guided ASP is flat. What kind of cost structures do you see getting to the May quarter from shrinks, et cetera?","Kipp A. Bedard","It's down a couple of percent.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And in terms of shrinks, well, from what are you going -- what node are you going to, 30-nanometer or 21-nanometer, on the DRAM side?","Kipp A. Bedard","Yes, we're seeing a nice shrink road map there, and again, taking into consideration the comments we just made about a lot of times the specialty cost per bit is slightly higher than the commodity cost per bit. So as you're transitioning to more of those bits on a Q-to-Q comparison, you may not get what you expect to see in the old days when 90% of the output was all PC commodity and you could go through a shrink and measure a pretty -- put a pretty linear methodology. So keep this mix shift in mind.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on the NAND side, you mentioned ASP is -- it looks like it was down a little bit more, but it was impaired by some legacy Numonyx product. What does -- how much of that was impacting the ASP? And do you see some of that dragging into the third quarter, fiscal third quarter also?","Kipp A. Bedard","We won't break out the contribution, if you will, to that sell-through. But generally speaking, we have about a couple more quarters to work through that inventory.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. So some of that is the activity that is that has to be tied -- basically the Numonyx stuff that's going broke?","Kipp A. Bedard","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Steven calling on behalf of Uche. First question I had on the DRAM side, could you talk about what your capacity mix you're starting to have on 30 nanometers for DRAM by the end of the fiscal year?","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, Steve, end of the calendar year, we'll be roughly 50%.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And also, in terms of your DRAM sales, what's the mix between competing versus noncompeting application?","Mark W. Adams","The overall computing personal systems piece of our business was about just slightly below 20%. Well, that's a little higher than that, was that?","Unknown Executive","Of the?","Unknown Executive","Yes.","Mark W. Adams","On personal systems? Okay, about 1\/3 of it -- I guess that's right. About 1\/3 of it in personal systems relative to the other markets.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So that does not include server, correct?","Mark W. Adams","Right.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then I guess the other major question I had on the DRAM business was for the specialty products. Just generally speaking, I know there's probably a range of process technologies that the different product lines are on. But just probably speaking for the higher-volume, like server packs, for example, will that be also within, say, 30 nanometers, for example, just due to the growing bit demand that you see in that market?","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, we're actually very encouraged with the progress on our 30-nanometer, not only in terms of yields and the way the ramps are going generally but also the quality level and the power performance it's delivering for the server market. So we anticipate that we will be able to accelerate that 30-nanometer ramp above and beyond what we would normally do. And we're still in the early process of qualifying all those products, but we're very encouraged by the way that's going. So generally speaking, we believe that we'll be able to ramp that node more aggressively than maybe we would typically do while maintaining a good mix of servers.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Perfect. Just one last quick one, if I could, on trade NAND bit sales. I know you guys mentioned it's up 36% in fiscal Q2. I'm just wondering. How much of that is also captured by any SSD products that you guys built during the quarter? Or is that 36% number purely, of course, that you guys sold through in the market of that type? Are those cards or other embedded applications?","Kipp A. Bedard","If I understood your question right, it was a little bit confusing, but I think the answer you're looking for is about 30%.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","For the non -- When excluding your SSD product sales, correct?","D. Mark Durcan","Well, I think what we're trying to say is about 30% of the trade NAND is SSDs in one way, shape or form. So either internal SSDs or NAND that we sell into somebody else's SSD products.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wondering if you could talk about the timing of the 20-nanometer NAND ramp? And sort of where you expect to be capacity-wise in the second half of this year for that technology node?","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, that's going to be -- again, it's going to be driven by product mix and the applications we're serving. I commented at the beginning of the call that we're actually ramping 20-nanometer in all 3 fabs and are now making plans to position additional capacity given the way technology node is going as well. So we're quite happy with the 20-nanometer performance and its acceptance in the marketplace. And that'll probably drive us to accelerate conversion as opposed to what we originally had planned.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And them as a follow-up, maybe you can just provide us with an update on the timing of your 20-nanometer DRAM ramp. And then for Ron, do you expect idle capacity charges for your NOR fabs in Q3? And if so, can you just give us a rough sense on how much those charges will be?","D. Mark Durcan","So this is Mark. Let me take the 20-nanometer DRAM node. That'll be early production in the summer next year.","Ronald C. Foster","Yes. And Harlan, in terms of the idle capacity, we've had some improvement, as I mentioned, with a little bit less idle capacity in our 200-millimeter activities. But we will continue to have some effect of that in the following quarter or 2, that's for sure. And then we expect it to pick up some later in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just to expand on Harlan's question on the 20-nanometer NAND Flash, will most of those products be 128-gigabit? Is that part of the mix?","D. Mark Durcan","Sorry, can you repeat the question?","Unknown Executive","Moving...","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I -- you're expecting the -- you're moving all 3 fabs on NAND Flash to 20 nanometers. What is the product mix? Is that 128-gigabit compared to...","D. Mark Durcan","They'll be a mix of 64 to 128.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that will help drive down the overall ASPs so much?","D. Mark Durcan","Well, it'll -- yes, typically, the higher density's selling at a slight discount, although early in the life, you can actually get a premium. So it kind of depends when the other guys get caught up. So there'll also be -- by the way, it makes it 2-bit, 3-bit-per-cell. As I commented coming into the call, we're sampling our 3-bit, 20-nanometer, 120-gig as well.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on ultrabooks now, it seems like the second generation of ultrabooks are being announced. How do you see the DRAM content? And then also, you have the C [ph] content for you?","Mark W. Adams","I think both's favorable for us. I think the challenge for us in the marketplace is really around pricing and the acceptance of the platform and volume. We think it's more of a best-case, a holiday product of 2012, more a 2013 volume product. But we still think it's pretty favorable in the DRAM side and, obviously, very positive on the NAND and the SSD form factor.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Goodman with CLSA.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I had a question on the server side or in the specialty side of DRAM. You had mentioned record bit shipments during the quarter but also a mix out of specialty was having an impact on pricing trends. So maybe, could you just help me understand exactly what happened in the quarter and how we should be modeling that going forward for the year?","Mark W. Adams","Sure. I think if you look it over -- the impact from the execution of the additional capacity we got out of Inotera, the overall output grew. And then our -- when I referred to the bit shipments, our bit shipments in servers grew as well, but not at the overall capacity.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then on just one other area within DRAM. You had mentioned mobile DRAM. It sounds like you guys are getting a bit more traction there. Maybe just an update on how that's looking today and how are -- that's been kind of written as a 2013 story in the past. How is it looking for 2012? Could that pull in at all given what's going on with your competitor?","Mark W. Adams","I think from an opportunity standpoint, there's an immense opportunity as we get more and more converted over to 30-series product, I think, if there are volumes in that category increased significantly.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. So kind of second half of this year, possibly?","Mark W. Adams","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners.","Ada Menaker","This is Ada in for Dan. I got a couple of questions for you. The first one is you talked about the potential asset purchase from Alpeta. What are some of the other likely scenarios and kind of, what would be negative scenarios, positive scenarios? And under what circumstances would you benefit the most?","D. Mark Durcan","I think that's going to be way too much speculation for us to comment on, Ada, sorry.","[",":p id=\"A01\" name=\"Ada Menaker\" type=\"A\" \/>","No problem. And in terms of NAND and the restructuring of the Intel JV, can you maybe talk about where you see NAND margins going as a result versus trade NAND?","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, again, we don't like to forecast either gross margins or net margins moving forward in time. There's just too much uncertainty relative to ASPs. What we can say is that the increased scale that we now have at our -- in our NAND business, not only by virtue of the asset acquisition from Intel but also by virtue of the successful ramp of IMFS, puts us in a much better position relative to our operating expenses relative to the overall scale of our business.","Ada Menaker","And in terms of OpEx as a result of the restructuring, any risks to that or...","D. Mark Durcan","Relative to the restructuring with Intel?","Ada Menaker","Yes.","D. Mark Durcan","No, I don't think so. We're anticipating that'll close very early in April. And again, we think it's a pretty beneficial agreement for both partners, actually. And Ron, by the way, is just reminding me that the other significant thing to keep in mind relative to the asset acquisition from Intel is that the -- when you think about Micron's margins in NAND overall, there's a significantly higher percentage now of that product that is trade NAND versus sold at Intel to cost. So that will also have an impact in the way you model margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess to stick on that topic of how we model this transaction, when I think about your cost of revenues, Ron, it's been a really pretty stable number. As you add capacity, cost of revs rises a little bit, as we saw this quarter, about $15 million. Is there a change in that cost of revenues line that's associated with you now owning the equipment? Or have you already been capturing that cost in that cost of revenue line?","Ronald C. Foster","Yes, Doug, the -- we consolidate all these joint ventures. So all the structure on the balance sheet, P&L, et cetera, is in our financial statements. The CapEx is in our CapEx numbers, the depreciation is in our depreciation numbers. So what you'll see is when a higher ownership percentage, so there'll be less equity share growing out to minority shareholders on the P&L. And as Mark already mentioned, we'll have more trade revenue business. But the cost structure will be essentially the same cost structure. We'll have the chance to leverage up the revenue portion of that with a higher trade mix. The rest of the cost structure is essentially as it was.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great, understood. If I could on another line, moving on to sort of a CapEx. You're holding your guidance at $2 billion for the year. Traditionally, we've sort of seen that to be more front half loaded. Again, it looks this year like that that's going to be the case, although given your spending in the first 2 quarters of the fiscal, it does look like we're going to sort of hold that line rather flat for the balance of the year. Is that sort of the way to think about it? Or are we not going to get a roll-off in the back half of the year?","Ronald C. Foster","Yes, as I mentioned, the -- 60% of our total CapEx budget was probably spent in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and it was related -- and into the second quarter, it was heavily related to the final payments -- build-out and payments on our IMFS capital. And as you heard the report on the ramp of that facility. So the remainder of the second half of the year is pretty low in the remaining balance, and it's going to be probably the $400 million range for the next couple of quarters.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. And I guess at that level, you'll have trouble getting to that $2 billion number, sort of, and it'll be underneath the $2 billion at that rate. That was what I was surprised by.","Ronald C. Foster","No, it'll be about $2 billion.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess one for you, Mark. When I look at the operational expenses, a new high hit here in this quarter. How do I think about OpEx being sort of controlled going forward? And what are the puts and takes you look at when looking to invest on R&D or SG&A cost lines?","D. Mark Durcan","Yes, well, I think going forward, you should think in terms of R&D being relatively flat moving forward. We are adding, as I mentioned, some cleaner space on equipment in the R&D operation. But overall, we're also getting some efficiencies there. And I think you should -- and some roll-off relative to previous existing equipment. So I think you should think of R&D as flattish moving forward. Relative to the SG&A, there were a number -- as Ron noted, there are a number of onetime events that hit our SG&A line this quarter. And I think those are really much more onetime-type events, and you would anticipate us going back to something more along the lines of what you've historically seen on that line. Ron, did you want to add anything?","Ronald C. Foster","No, it's right on. I just want to -- I gave you the -- our view, $155 million to $165 million, which is sort of the typical range of SG&A. They were just blips in the quarter that affected the total cost by about $20 million.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then the one market that you guys haven't given us an update on, or if I could get some more color on, I guess I'd ask, is on the wireless base. Clearly, the NOR side of the business struggling in that market. What's your outlook for sort of the build rate at your customers? Are we going to start to see sort of production levels on that side of the business pick up? How -- what's your demand outlook there?","Mark W. Adams","I think the demand outlook, if I understand your question, is still fairly positive. I think what you're seeing a little bit is the continued shift in mix towards the -- a higher percentage of smartphones as the overall product category. And so that's rewarding those with a portfolio that have a broad breadth of MCPs and MMC-type offerings. So -- and also, the customer concentration is different because people who were successful in smartphones weren't necessarily the leaders in the feature phone. So there's a lot of dynamics shifting. But I think overall, we still are very optimistic about the continued growth in that category.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess my first question, Mark, is given the increasing importance of mix, I'm assuming there are some quarters where you guys will have the opportunity to move mix to higher-profit areas and then other quarters either because of demand or customer needs, you won't be able to do that. I guess if you look at the fiscal third quarter, is the assumption I should be making is that these mix shifts are all moving toward higher-margin products? Or could you help me understand the puts and takes there from a product perspective?","D. Mark Durcan","I think obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes that get you to the aggregated view. But I think generally speaking, we're looking at a richer mix as we move into fiscal Q3, especially in DRAM.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, guys, my second question. And I apologize. I know you had talked about mobile RAM. What percent of revenue is it today? What would you expect it to be 12 months from now? And I guess the reason why I ask the question, it's clear, as we're moving from single core to kind of multi-core processors in things like smartphones and tablets, that memory density, CBRAM [ph] density is going up. And so I'm just trying to get a better sense of how big of a business is it today for you? Where do you think it can go? And is it above sort of corporate average margins?","[",":p id=\"29457912\" name=\"Mark Adams\" type=\"E\" \/>","Let me -- admittedly, I think we're probably behind in our participation in that category today. As I commented on, we think we're positioned pretty well technology-wise with 30-series coming out in the back half of the year. And I think industry dynamics are favoring that our customers are coming and leaning on us hard to get there quick because there are some scaled opportunities there from a volume standpoint. So I want to be careful not to start to share volumes numbers out per se, but we think it's going to be pretty significant by the end of this year or early next year.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I think as my last question, just any updates you can give us, some kind of industry DRAM bit growth assumptions for the calendar 2012? And I guess given all the potential scenarios around Alpeta, how do we bracket the highs and lows around that estimate?","Kipp A. Bedard","John, it looks like, if you look at the third-party data, it's probably anywhere between, on a production basis, 30% to 35% bit growth in 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Newman with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A quick question first on the NAND pricing and demand side. How do you see that strengthening? Now obviously, we're still seeing some weakness right now. Just wondering when you'll see NAND pricing strengthen and then maybe looking forward, if you can make some comments on the supply side and how that's balancing with the demand in the second half of this year and into next year.","Mark W. Adams","The best way to characterize our position on that is we think that this a kind of an adjustment in terms of what's happened out of the SSD build from the Thailand situation, which we've commented on in the call today. We think it's a short-term phenomenon. We're pretty optimistic in the back half the year that the demand and supply balance in NAND will continue.","Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great, that's fantastic. And a follow-up question on NAND. Obviously, you've got the deal with Intel shaping out. To better model that, can I get some estimate for the NAND on a volume basis, the percentage of your NAND business that is trade and how that will change going forward based on the Intel agreement?","Ronald C. Foster","Mark, this is Ron. We've -- I'm not going to break it down to a specific percentage, but we gave you a view of the Intel volume. It's going to be about the same in this quarter we're in right now. I wouldn't expect a big change with the transaction occurring, as Mark mentioned, in early April. Then it'll trend down a little bit. We'll be reporting the supply agreement portion as -- which has a profit margin, in our trade numbers. And so it will go up in the mix. But we'll certainly update you on that as we go forward. And you got a rough view for me of the wafer mix that is coming out from Micron as well.","Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the trade gross margin that's coming from this Intel business, is it fair to assume that is obviously going to be more than the old Intel business, but less than the rest of your trade business? Is that a fair assumption?","Ronald C. Foster","We're not going to call out specific margin on an agreement like that.","Kipp A. Bedard","And I think we have time up for one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, in terms of your trend NAND guide, I'm curious whether that's pro forma for the closure of the JV. Or is that something that could drive upside?","D. Mark Durcan","Did you want the trade NAND trend?","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","D. Mark Durcan","That is our prediction for trade production from Micron's trade business as I described it. As I just mentioned, we don't expect to see a big swing in the current quarter we're in right now, the third quarter.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, can you remind me in terms of what you're comfortable with in terms of leverage? You're a healthy $2.1 billion in cash, $2.2 billion in debt. How should we think about debt-to-kind of EBITDA and leverage go-forward? What you would be comfortable with at sort of the extreme?","Ronald C. Foster","Well, the communication that we've given fairly consistently is that we target over the long run to be in the 20% to 25% debt-to-capital range. Right now, we're running right at 20%. And that can, of course, vary with market cycles and with strategic decisions that we make in the business. But in general, the range we're comfortable with over the long run is in the -- the upper end will be the 25% kind of range over a long-term trend. But of course, that can vary in interim periods based upon market conditions and strategic decisions.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. I could sneak one last -- one in for Ron. When you guys turn profitable, what kind of share count should we be thinking about?","Ronald C. Foster","Well, we got -- you can see from our converts that some of them kick in at profit levels. For example, at $60 million net income, one of our converts kicks into the measurement, et cetera, and then a couple of more at $200 million kind of profit range. So the dilution affects from the converts would come in at those kind of income levels.","Kipp A. Bedard","And with that, we'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

Good afternoon. Fiscal 2019 was another solid year of execution as we continue to transform the new Micron. Despite the challenging industry environment, we achieved the second-best year in our history for revenue, free cash flow and earnings, which underscores the strength of the new Micron.","We improved structural profitability by further reducing the technology gap with competitors and by strengthening our product portfolio. We also made progress on our $10 billion share repurchase program by returning $2.7 billion to our shareholders.","In the fiscal fourth quarter, the Micron team\u2019s strong execution resulted in financial performance exceeding our guidance ranges. Market trends were broadly consistent with our expectations discussed on the last earnings call.","DRAM demand bounced back as the factors that impacted calendar first half demand largely dissipated. NAND elasticity is driving robust demand growth, causing industry inventories to improve rapidly. While the demand recovery in DRAM and NAND is encouraging, we remain mindful of ongoing macroeconomic and trade uncertainties. I will provide more color on our view of the market after a review of progress on our key strategic objectives.","Since 2016, the actions we have taken to reduce our cost structure, increase our mix of high-value solutions, and enhance our customer engagement and go-to-market strategy have significantly improved our profitability relative to our peers.","In fiscal 2019, our DRAM cost per bit declines led the industry and exceeded our internal plans, despite the headwinds from our announced reduction in wafer starts. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we began mass production and volume shipments of the industry\u2019s first 1Z products, giving Micron feature size leadership for DRAM.","We are also making good progress migrating more of our production to leading-edge nodes. While we entered fiscal 2019 with more than half of our bit production on 20 nanometer or older nodes, we ended the fiscal year with approximately three-quarters on 1X and beyond, with a meaningful portion on 1Y.","As previously announced, we are expanding cleanroom space in our Taichung, Taiwan, site to support future node transitions of our existing wafer capacity, and we expect output from this facility in calendar 2021.","In NAND, we continued to outpace industry cost declines during fiscal 2019. 96-layer 3D NAND is continuing to increase as a portion of our mix. Meanwhile, we achieved our first yielding dies using replacement gate or RG for short. This milestone further reduces the risk for our RG transition.","As a reminder, our first RG node will be 128 layers and will be used for a select set of products. We don\u2019t expect RG to deliver meaningful cost reductions until fiscal 2021 when our second-generation RG node is broadly deployed. Consequently, we are expecting minimal cost reductions in NAND in fiscal 2020.","Our RG production deployment approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND capital investments. In addition, we announced the grand opening of our Singapore cleanroom expansion in August, which will enable the transition of our existing NAND wafer capacity to future generations of 3D NAND technology. We are continuing to make solid progress with our 3D XPoint product development and remain on track to launch our initial products in calendar 2019.","Now turning to highlights by markets. In SSDs, the industry transition from SATA to NVMe in fiscal 2019 continued at a rapid rate. While we have been late to the NVMe market, our progress positions us to gain share starting in fiscal 2020. For OEMs, building on strong growth last quarter, we more than tripled revenue shipments of our NVMe client SSD sequentially with sales penetration in multiple Tier 1 PC OEMs.","Our QLC-based NVMe consumer SSD was a best-selling SSD on Amazon Prime Day in North America. Our consumer SSD segment achieved record revenue and unit shipments with bits posting triple-digit percentage growth year-over-year, driven by our strategy to pursue channel expansion that extends our geographical and customer reach.","Price elasticity is driving an increase in attach rates and capacities, leading to solid demand growth across client and consumer SSDs. We are also making solid progress on advancing our roadmap of NVMe SSDs for the enterprise and cloud markets.","In fiscal 2019, we introduced the high-performance 9300 line of NVMe products, targeting high-end data center applications, and are looking forward to increasing adoption of this product.","In mobile, our portfolio featuring the industry\u2019s lowest-power and highest-density products is enabling our customers to bring differentiated capabilities to the market and helping us deliver outstanding financial performance in a challenging industry environment.","In fiscal 2019, we delivered mobile revenue that was down only 3% from 2018\u2019s record performance, despite a significant drop in market pricing and the impact from the addition of Huawei to the Entity List. Our mobile margins were resilient, and our managed NAND bit shipments in fiscal 2019 more than tripled year-on-year, driven by growth of MCP and discrete NAND eMMC and UFS products.","In the fiscal fourth quarter, we started volume shipments of a new leading-edge UFS-based MCP that uses our 1Z LPDRAM. This new UFS MCP will bring flagship-like performance and densities to mid and high-end smartphones. We are also leading the industry in power-efficient, high-bandwidth LP5 DRAM, which positions us well as 5G begins to accelerate in 2020.","In data center, customer inventories for DRAM have reduced significantly, driving solid sequential demand growth for server solutions in both cloud and enterprise markets. New processor platforms are also creating an uptick in demand for higher-density and higher-performance DRAM modules.","In graphics, we saw strong sequential bit growth, with increases for graphics cards and gaming consoles, as normal buying resumed following inventory reductions in DRAM. In the PC market, DRAM module and SSD shipments continued the growth trend from last quarter, as CPU shortages further subsided.","In automotive, we continued to increase revenue year-over-year, despite weak auto industry unit sales and a challenging DRAM industry environment. Our growth was supported by secular content increases, our superior quality, and well-established customer relationships. LP4 shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter were over 5x higher year-over-year, as lower-power DRAM becomes increasingly important for new Infotainment and ADAS systems. We continue to have leading industry share in automotive.","Before talking about the market outlook, I want to provide an update on our business with Huawei and the ongoing impact of trade uncertainties. As we noted last quarter, we started shipping some products to Huawei that are not subject to Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions.","In the fiscal fourth quarter, sales to Huawei declined sequentially and were down meaningfully from the levels we anticipated prior to the addition of Huawei to the Entity List.","We have applied for licenses with the Department of Commerce that would allow us to ship additional products, but there have been no decisions on licenses to date. We see ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. China trade negotiations. If the Entity List restrictions against Huawei continue and we are unable to get licenses, we could see a worsening decline in our sales to Huawei over the coming quarters.","Now, turning to our market outlook, which assumes that the macroeconomic environment doesn\u2019t materially deteriorate from current levels. I\u2019ll begin with our industry outlook, and then turn to Micron\u2019s outlook for DRAM and NAND.","The DRAM and NAND industry demand growth in the second half of calendar 2019, compared to the first half, is primarily being driven by a normalization of inventories at most customers, and secular growth trends in various end markets.","In recent months, we have seen increased demand from customers headquartered in mainland China, some of whom could be making strategic decisions to build higher levels of inventory in the face of increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as Japan and Korea.","Our view of calendar 2019 DRAM industry bit demand growth remains unchanged at mid-teens, with supply exceeding demand due to previously discussed factors that impacted first half calendar 2019 demand.","Based on our early view of calendar 2020, we expect the industry to see bit demand growth of high-teens to 20%, above supply growth of only mid-teens, which should help normalize supplier inventories and enable a healthy industry environment. We expect the long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR to be mid to high-teens.","Turning to NAND industry outlook, demand elasticity and industry supply reductions are resulting in improving market conditions and declining industry inventory. On the supply side, CapEx and wafer start cuts across the industry are leading to supply reductions. A power outage at a competitor\u2019s fab also reduced industry supply and inventory.","We now expect calendar 2019 industry bit demand growth in the low to mid-40% range, which will exceed industry bit supply growth of approximately 30%. Based on our view of calendar 2020, we estimate industry bit demand growth of high 20s to low-30% range, with supply growing somewhat below demand.","We believe that NAND industry margins, which are at the lowest levels in the last 10 years, should start increasing for the rest of the year. We expect the long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR to be in the low-30% range.","Specific to Micron\u2019s DRAM outlook, we are seeing solid demand from customers across multiple segments. This is improving our inventory, and we have started to see pockets of tight supply, particularly in leading-edge nodes. However, we still have elevated inventory levels on older nodes. As a result, we are continuing with the previously disclosed DRAM wafer start reductions of 5%.","We expect Micron\u2019s calendar 2019 bit supply growth to be slightly below industry demand growth of mid-teens, and expect our calendar 2020 DRAM bit supply growth to be close to the market demand growth. We also expect our DRAM cost reductions to moderate in fiscal 2020 to high-single digits. As we have said before, the increasing complexity of more advanced DRAM nodes is resulting in a slower pace of cost declines for the industry.","As our DRAM inventory improves, we are committed to maintaining price discipline. While we are having to respond to some aggressive market pricing, we have started walking away from some transactions, as we look to optimize our profitability.","Turning to Micron\u2019s NAND outlook, we expect our calendar 2019 bit growth to be slightly above industry supply growth, and in calendar 2020, we expect Micron\u2019s bit supply growth to be significantly below the industry demand growth as we transition a limited portion of our wafer starts to our first-generation replacement gate node and use inventory to support customer demand. Supply growth will also be impacted by our previously announced wafer start reductions of approximately 10%.","We are seeing some capacity tightness in our back-end manufacturing operations due to significant increases in demand for high-capacity NAND products. This is another data point of elasticity kicking in on high-value NAND solutions.","While NAND and DRAM market conditions are showing some promising signs, in order to bring our supply in line with the market demand, we are targeting our fiscal 2020 front-end equipment CapEx to be reduced by more than 30% from fiscal 2019. Our CapEx decision is also influenced by macroeconomic uncertainty and low industry profitability.","Our front-end CapEx outlook reflects our strategy for limited ramp of our first RG node. While we are reducing front-end equipment CapEx, we are spending significantly more on shell space to enable future node transition, and also investing in a new SSD packaging facility in Penang, Malaysia. As always, we will maintain flexibility and discipline while investing appropriately for Micron\u2019s long-term success.","I want to emphasize that our goal is to manage our DRAM and NAND bit supply growth CAGR in line with industry demand. As we catch up on the technology and cost gaps to best-in-class competitors in DRAM and transition to RG technology in NAND, our supply growth may fluctuate, but we expect the medium-to-long-term growth rate of our supply to approximately equal the rate of demand growth across both NAND and DRAM markets.","We are also focused on maximizing the ROI of our CapEx investments. And for this reason, we are not emphasizing wafer capacity growth, but instead focusing on bit growth driven by technology transitions. In addition, some of our CapEx is dedicated to increasing our internal capacity for assembly, packaging and test, which help us drive cost reductions without adding any bit growth and has good ROI.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.","David Zinsner","Thanks Sanjay. As Sanjay mentioned, Micron delivered resilient performance throughout a challenging year for the industry, highlighted by fiscal Q4 results that exceeded our guided ranges for revenue and earnings.","As market conditions evolved during the year, we curtailed our planned operating expenses and capital expenditures, allowing us to preserve margins and generate healthy free cash flow.","We achieved our first corporate investment grade rating, strengthened our balance sheet, and meaningfully reduced our share count. All-in-all, fiscal 2019 was a year of stellar progress that sets Micron up for attractive growth as industry conditions recover.","Turning to our recent financial results. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was approximately $4.9 billion. Revenue was up 2% sequentially and down 42% year-over-year. Revenue exceeded our guidance range largely due to better-than-expected demand. Full fiscal 2019 revenue totaled $23.4 billion, down 23% year-over-year.","Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $3.1 billion, representing 63% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 1% sequentially and declined 48% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew approximately 30% sequentially and in the mid-teens percent range year-on-year, as customer inventories improved significantly.","ASP declined approximately 20% sequentially. For full fiscal 2019, DRAM revenue was $15.2 billion, down 28% from fiscal 2018 as bits grew in the low single-digit percent range and ASP declined approximately 30%.","Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, or 31% of total revenue. Revenue was up 5% sequentially, but declined 32% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew in the low-to-mid-teens percent range sequentially. ASP declined in the upper single-digit percent range. We are starting to see supply tightness in portions of the NAND market, and prices are beginning to increase.","Full fiscal 2019 NAND revenue was $6.9 billion, down 12% from fiscal 2018, as ASP declines of mid-40% range more than offset strong bit shipment growth.","Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $1.9 billion in fiscal Q4, a decline of 8% sequentially and down 56% year-over-year. ASP declines across most segments continued to be the leading cause of lower revenue. For the fiscal year, revenue was $10 billion, down 35% year-over-year.","Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit in fiscal Q4 was $1.4 billion, up 20% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Both DRAM and NAND bits had strong growth driven by seasonality and continued content growth in smartphones. Our mobile business gained share in the year, driven by a stronger product portfolio. For the full fiscal year, MBU revenue was $6.4 billion, down only 3% from fiscal 2018.","Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in fiscal Q4 was $848 million, an increase of 4% from fiscal Q3 and down 32% year-over-year. For the fiscal year, SBU revenue was $3.8 billion, down 24% from fiscal 2018.","And finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $705 million in fiscal Q4, up 1% from fiscal Q3 and down 24% from the prior year. For the fiscal year, EBU revenue was $3.1 billion, down 10% from fiscal 2018.","The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was 30.6%, above our guidance range due to our strong execution, improving demand and slightly better pricing. Q4 gross margins included approximately 200 basis point negative impact or approximately $100 million due to the underutilization charges at IMFT.","Starting in fiscal Q1 and continuing for the foreseeable future, we expect to incur an underutilization impact of approximately $150 million per quarter, with about half of the impact consisting of non-cash items.","Over time, as our 3D XPoint business ramps, this underutilization impact will be mitigated, but as you can expect, it takes time to commercialize a new breakthrough technology. Meanwhile, we will continue to look for ways to optimize our costs and will provide updates on material progress over time.","With respect to U.S. tariffs on imports from China, with continued mitigation, we were able to contain their impact on our consolidated gross margin in fiscal Q4 to less than 20 basis points.","Operating expenses were $797 million, and included some one-time expenses. We continue to control our expenses tightly, and our SG&A as a percent of revenue is meaningfully lower than our competitors.","Fiscal Q4 operating income was $694 million, representing 14% of revenue. Operating margin was down 38 percentage points year-over-year and down 9 percentage points from fiscal Q3. Our full fiscal 2019 operating income was $7.8 billion or 33% of our fiscal year revenue.","Our fiscal Q4 effective tax rate was 8.8%. For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate was approximately 7.3%, which included the tax benefit we recorded in fiscal Q3. Going forward, we expect our tax rate to be mid-to-high single digits.","Non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q4 were $0.56, down from $1.05 in fiscal Q3 and $3.53 in the year-ago quarter. For full fiscal 2019, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.35, down from $11.95 in fiscal 2018.","Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2.2 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q4, representing 46% of revenue. For full fiscal 2019, cash from operations was $13.2 billion, representing 56% of revenue, down from $17.4 billion or 57% of revenue in fiscal 2018. Cash flow margins remained almost flat due to effective working capital management.","During the quarter, net capital spending, was approximately $2 billion, down from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter. For full fiscal 2019, our net CapEx was $9.1 billion, up from $8.2 billion in fiscal 2018, but down meaningfully from the $10 billion to $11 billion plan we originally had entering fiscal 2019.","We expect our fiscal 2020 net CapEx to be in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion, down meaningfully from fiscal 2019. We expect that CapEx for buildings and back-end manufacturing will increase significantly from last year, while the front-end equipment CapEx will decline more than 30% year-on-year.","Looking at cash generation, we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $260 million in fiscal Q4 compared to $500 million in fiscal Q3 and $3.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2019 was $4.1 billion, down from $9.2 billion in fiscal 2018.","We received notice for approximately $180 million of convertible note redemptions in the quarter, which will remove approximately 4 million shares from our ongoing share count in fiscal Q1. For full fiscal 2019, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks, representing 65% of free cash flow, at an average purchase price of $40.","Including these share repurchases and our convertible note redemptions, we reduced our average diluted share count by 80 million shares in fiscal 2019, representing 7% of shares outstanding. We remain committed to returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in the future.","Days of inventory was 131, down from 143 days in fiscal Q3. Inventory ended the quarter at $5.1 billion, increasing from $4.9 billion at the end of fiscal Q3. We will continue to focus on reducing our days of inventory and expect to see further reduction in fiscal Q1.","As mentioned before, we are seeing pockets of tight supply in certain parts of our business. Our long-term normalized inventory target has increased over time to above 100 days as a result of greater process complexity and the broadening of our product portfolio to high-value solutions, such as SSDs that require longer assembly and test cycle time.","Total cash ended the quarter at $9.2 billion, up quarter-over-quarter, largely as a result of our $1.75 billion investment grade debt issuance. Our total debt increased to $5.9 billion. Total liquidity ended fiscal Q4 at $13 billion.","We are holding approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity for the acquisition of the IMFT joint venture, expected in fiscal Q1 2020. This acquisition will eliminate approximately $700 million of member debt financing and will be funded by drawing down $1.25 billion from our term loan facility secured in fiscal Q4.","Before moving on to guidance, I want to share some expected changes to our upcoming reporting. We continue to evaluate planned technology node transitions, capital spending, and re-use rates for NAND equipment.","Based on our preliminary assessment, we anticipate changing the depreciable life of our NAND equipment from five to seven years beginning in fiscal Q1 2020. This change will reduce our depreciation expense included in cost of goods sold for Q1 by approximately $80 million, and increasing to approximately $100 million to $150 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, depreciable life for DRAM equipment is already seven years.","Also starting in Q1, we expect to change how we report MCP revenue, which we currently include within NAND revenue. We will begin disaggregating MCP revenue into DRAM and NAND, which will reduce our reported NAND revenue and margins in FQ1 while increasing our DRAM revenue. We believe that this change will help improve the transparency of our DRAM and NAND businesses.","Now turning to our financial outlook. As our portfolio strengthens and we improve our share in high-value segments, we are seeing growing demand for both DRAM and NAND and this is creating pockets of supply shortage, particularly in some leading-edge nodes and in back-end manufacturing.","However, the market remains competitive and industry inventories continue to adjust to economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Notwithstanding these challenges, we expect bit shipments for both DRAM and NAND to grow in fiscal Q1, with NAND increasing more than DRAM.","With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, gross margin to be in the range of 26.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points, and operating expenses to be approximately $780 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.46, plus or minus $0.07.","Despite a variety of industry and trade-related challenges in fiscal 2019, Micron delivered strong financial results. At our 2018 Analyst Day, we laid out how we believed Micron was structurally improved and able to weather the storm in even challenging periods for the industry. While we are not out of the woods, we are proud of our execution as we have moved through the current cycle.","We are exiting the fiscal year with a stronger product portfolio, deeper customer relationships, and our highest liquidity and net cash position to date, and we have also made good progress on our share buyback program. We are well-positioned to emerge from the current cycle ready to capitalize on the secular growth trends driving our business.","I will now turn the call over to Sanjay for concluding remarks.","Sanjay Mehrotra","Thank you, Dave. Fiscal 2019 has been a solid year of accomplishments for the New Micron, as we continue to focus on structural improvements across a range of functions in the Company, to take our performance to new heights. While we have made dramatic progress over the last couple of years, there is significant opportunity ahead of us to further improve our operations, drive product cost reductions, further improve engineering execution, build on our go-to-market strategy and initiatives, deepen customer engagements, and enhance the core competitiveness of the Company to best-in-class levels.","As we look ahead, the long-term opportunities are exciting, and we are extremely enthusiastic about the momentum we have established at the New Micron. On October 24th, we\u2019ll be hosting our Second Annual Micron Insight event, which will bring together leaders from across the industry to discuss how a world activated by data can transform the way we use information to enrich life and how memory and storage are vital to these efforts. We will be webcasting Micron Insight live from San Francisco, and I encourage you all to tune in.","We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. So I'm going to talk a little bit about your customers' inventory levels. And one of the big concerns or debates in the financial community at the moment is whether the pickup in memory volumes that I think Micron seeing, is that mostly being driven by fundamentals? Or is it just potential inventory stocking because of some of the trade concerns?","And Sanjay, I think you maybe talked about a bit of both factors in your prepared comments and some potential inventory stock, but also inventory coming down in some important markets like data center. So maybe you can just kind of level set and put those things together and do you think the pickup in your business is it primarily been driven by fundamentals or how much of this is maybe some of that inventory stocking because of trade concerns? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think certainly the pickup in business is being driven by the industry fundamentals. I would just like to remind you that in the first half of calendar 2019 because of the inventory that the customers had built up the demand to the producers was low, yet the end market demand for all applications continue to be robust. And now as the customers have worked down their inventory to normal levels, the demand is coming back to the producers and as a result, you saw in our calendar \u2013 I mean fiscal Q4 results a strong growth in DRAM bit as well as NAND.","And second half is the demand is back \u2013 the customer demand is back. And yes, there maybe some level of inventory build in China, due to the reasons that I mentioned by certain customers. But I'll tell you that we do not think that that inventory build is anywhere close to the kind of inventory build that had gone on in the second half of last year, so no where materially close to that level.","So overall, the industry environment in terms of demand return is certainly solid. Certainly in DRAM, there is still some excess supply with the producers. But the inventory is improving fast; we talked about our inventory actually improving faster than would we perhaps anticipated some time ago and overall we even see some shortages in some leading-edge products particularly on the DRAM side.","So overall we think that industry, inventory at the producers is being consumed at a rapid clip. The demand trends are back to normal levels. And especially when you look at the trends of through next year 5G, you look at smartphone average capacity is continuing to increase both for NAND and DRAM, and cloud demand drivers continuing to be solid, new platforms, new CP architectures being used that allow greater use and higher use of DRAM capacities as well as AI applications driving more DRAM and NAND.","So the demand trends, when I look at 2020 I believe that the industry demand\/supply environment will be in a lot healthier place. Yes, maybe calendar Q1 may have some cyclicality, but the industry fundamentals overall from demand\/supply point of view, I think in 2020 will be in a much healthier place.","David Zinsner","Another way to look at this and kind of back it up mathematically is if you look at the year-over-year bit growth in the fourth quarter it's only in the kind of 14% kind of range. So that kind of backs up the idea that this is really about industry fundamentals, more so than it is about stocking inventory.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results given the macro uncertainty. I guess I have several questions, just around the guidance gross margins for the fiscal first quarter. If you look at the incremental, you think you're getting from IMFT that's more than offset by kind of the change in depreciation and yet you still kind of getting sort of a 400 basis point drop sequentially in gross margin on kind of flattish to up revenue.","And I know you guys don't comment about future pricing, but can you talk about other puts and takes around mix that might be negatively impacting kind of the gross margin and I guess given that the incremental cost of IMFT is probably driven by you taking receipt of the whole joint venture in the month of November why wouldn't that hit get higher as you go into the fiscal second quarter and have it for the full quarter.","David Zinsner","Okay. So yes, let me kind of walk through a little bit of the puts and takes. Obviously pricing is a factor in the expectations around gross margins for the first fiscal quarter. And of course, we don't talk necessarily about forward pricing.","But the second piece is cost. And as Sanjay mentioned, our cost declines for fiscal 2020 in total will be kind of high-single digits that's lower than the cost declines we got in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018.","And so we are seeing a slower rate of cost declines for DRAM, and that's of course something we've indicated was coming given the complexities that we face in as we migrate nodes. And as we talked about obviously on the NAND side, we're going to have very minimal cost declines as we kind of transition to replacement gate. So those are certainly factors in that, and I would tell you that the first quarter cost declines are very minimal.","The third piece is mix. If you look at the mix from just a move to high value solutions, that of course is positive, but what is overshadowing that is the mix of NAND and DRAM. And of course, NAND has a lower gross margin than DRAM. And we will see likely a higher mix of NAND next quarter which will affect gross margins negatively.","And then as you pointed out, there's two kind of unusual items I guess in the quarter. One is the change in the useful life of NAND equipment that will be positive, but more than half of that will be offset by underutilization expenses associated with IMFT. So those are kind of all the puts and takes of gross margins.","I think it's likely that it will be a little higher from Q1 to Q2 in terms of underutilization expenses, but it was somewhat in the noise. We might be a little bit lower than $150 million of underutilization expense in fiscal Q1, and we might be a little higher than that in fiscal Q2.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC.","Mitchell Steves","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to kind of poke again on the gross margin question that\u2019s asked. But one of the bigger question I have is just with your commentary about pricing getting better, but then you're talking about gross margin is going down on a higher revenue base. So if you offset that with depreciation as well, I mean does that imply that November quarter should be the bottom for gross margins? Or are you guys implying that February could also be down sequentially?","David Zinsner","Well, I think clearly we're talking about NAND getting better. And we are seeing the early signs in DRAM of kind of the fundamentals getting better, demand is coming back, inventories on our balance sheet and the industry's balance sheets are coming down. Of course that hasn't gotten completely to where it needs to be.","And also as Sanjay mentioned in his prepared remarks, the market continues to be a bit competitive and so we'll have to see when that all those things come together and supply kind of aligns with demand to drive more healthy market or healthier market for DRAM.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPM.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. On your fiscal 2020 DRAM outlook for high-single digits cost reductions versus fiscal 2019, is that how we should think about your longer-term annualized cost down profile given the higher complexity capital intensity that you are aligned? Or are there some impacts from the pullback in utilizations, drawdown of your own inventories and\/or maybe a slower 1Z transition that's impacting the cost down profile as well?","David Zinsner","We definitely have some underutilization expenses in DRAM. Certainly we have that built into our expectations for the first fiscal quarter. It may last into the second fiscal quarter. And so that certainly is an impact, but I would tell you that over time as complexity of these nodes goes up and as capital intensity goes up, the cost declines are going to become more challenging. So the high single-digit will probably not be something we can routinely do year-to-year.","Sanjay Mehrotra","And I\u2019ll just add that we are certainly narrowing the cost gap in terms of DRAM production cost overall. 1Z node is a good example of Micron\u2019s leadership being the first one to introduce the 1Z node with the smallest feature size in the industry. And the result of cost improvements that we are making on DRAM as well as of course the high value solutions that are driving higher mix on the NAND side is a major improvement. 2,500 plus basis point improvement in our EBITDA margins versus the competition compared to the past 2016 timeframe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman with Bernstein.","Mark Newman","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about inventory down quite a bit Q-on-Q. You gave some numbers on that. Do you have a bit more breakdown on how that compares DRAM versus NAND?","And then looking forward to next-gen technology, you've obviously got \u2013 it's quite difficult to transition to the replacement gate to NAND. Can you give an update on the timing for that where you are on the 96 layers or where are your current generation [indiscernible] and where \u2013 can you give little bit details in the timing to the demand replacement there. Thanks very much. ","Sanjay Mehrotra","So Dave will comment on your inventory part of the question, but let me just address your question on the 96-layers. As we had said before, 96-layer execution has gone very well with the Company in terms of yield ramp. 96-layer technology has given us the fastest yield ramp of any other NAND technologies in the past. So we are very proud of that accomplishment and 96-layer is continuing to ramp during the course of our fiscal year 2020. In fact, 96-layer will be the major driver of our NAND bit growth in fiscal year 2020.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with respect to replacement gate, we have seen now functionality and yielding dies. We are certainly quite encouraged by that and continue to work on technology and product development. In fiscal year 2020, 64-layer and 96-layer will continue to be the workhorse technologies and our replacement gate technology of course will have a small mix in fiscal year 2020 for us as well.","Keep in mind, our first replacement gate node, which will have small production in fiscal year 2020 will be a rather limited node because we'll be deploying it across select set of products. It's our second generation node, which will of course come in the subsequent fiscal year that will give us \u2013 position us well and resume the year-over-year strong cost reductions for us. But basically the 96-layer will continue to ramp during fiscal year 2020 for us.","David Zinsner","Okay. So on the inventory question, if you \u2013 so we had 143 days of inventory in the third quarter that came down to 131 days in the fourth fiscal quarter. If you kind of break that out between DRAM and NAND, DRAM was meaningfully below that and NAND was meaningfully above that. I would say in terms of days, obviously in absolute dollars, DRAM has more inventory than NAND.","I would say that was \u2013 you got to remember there are two reasons why inventory was building for NAND. It was building as we kind of slowed down our supply, but customers were working down their inventory. Now the adjustments we've made to our supply both in terms of capital spending reductions and in terms of utilization adjustments, we have brought our inventory down pretty meaningfully this quarter. We expect to bring it down again meaningfully next quarter.","On the NAND side, we have elevated levels of inventory, but that's more strategic. What we're trying to do is, have some built up inventory in fiscal 2019 that we can use in fiscal 2020 to support the RG transition because the replacement gate transition will not drive a lot of bit growth. And so in order to support the increased demand next year, we will have to utilize this inventory for that purpose.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to hit on your commentary around DRAM and on the ongoing industry in calendar 2019. Within that, is that largely driven by Huawei, perhaps more aggressive competitors in certain markets, change in mix? I love to hear your thoughts on that. And then as we move into calendar 2020, what are your expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the market \u2013 for your market share? Thank you.","Sanjay Mehrotra","So in terms of overall bits, with respect to DRAM growth in terms of revenue, I mean it has primarily been impacted by the customer inventories that were built up last year for the first half. And our overall DRAM shipments are in line with overall, the industry, in this regard.","And I think what we said is that the industry demand mid-teens and our overall supply growth during the calendar 2019 to be slightly below the industry of course as a result of some of the underutilization actions that we have taken.","And of course, there is an impact of Huawei in terms of our overall business. We had said before that compared to the levels that we anticipated before Huawei's placement on the Entity Listing, our revenue is lower. And of course, we are very much focused on continuing to diversify our revenue base. But yes, I mean, the Huawei Entity Listing does have an effect on some of our shipments to the customer. I mean, some of our overall shipments in the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Co.","Rajvindra Gill","Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. You had mentioned that you did see some elevated inventory levels in the lower process nodes. I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate on that particular comment.","Sanjay Mehrotra","This is really related to some of our overall production and mix and if some of the older nodes have lower demand compared to our total supply available, and therefore that's where we are primarily running underutilization on the DRAM side. So it really is about the overall demand and this is good inventory that overall will get consumed over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could help me parse out the CapEx guidance a little bit more in detail. I know last quarter relative to the $9.1 billion you did for the full-year, you talked about roughly $2 billion for kind of cleanroom and facility kind of CapEx. Was that the case? And I think on the basis of that, what is that kind of CapEx spend specifically embedded into your fiscal 2020 guidance?","David Zinsner","Yes. It was a little bit lower than the $2 billion number, but certainly a meaningful part of our spend. And you could probably parse out from what Sanjay said. We expect that number to increase in fiscal 2020, and the opposite is we expect the front-end equipment spend to decrease in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019. We also \u2013 we'll obviously make another investment in the back-end and we're expecting that to be roughly similar to what we're spending and what would be spent in fiscal 2019.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Yes. Hi, guys. Just wondering on the same CapEx line, I know you guys talked about equipment CapEx being down 30%, so it looks like close to $5 billion for fiscal 2020. Just wondering what the spit could be on NAND and DRAM? Thanks.","David Zinsner","We don't tend to break that out. But I guess I would just tell you that our plan is to reduce front-end equipment spend in both DRAM and NAND next year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Two follow-ups. We talked about the demand trends are positive, but I want to get a better assessment of how do you see data centers. There has been some conversation in industry that data center demand is seasonal. Some argue that it is better than seasonal.","And Sanjay, I want to get your view, how do you see the data center demand for both SSDs and DRAM is tracking. And in that context, I'm surprised with your NAND bit demand projection for next year. This is well below a historical trend of near 40%. What do you attribute this NAND demand trend into 2020, which in my opinion is well below a trend line?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So with respect to the NAND demand trend in calendar year 2020, I mean, just keep in mind that in calendar 2018 the industry grew by approximately 45%, in calendar year 2019, again, by about 45% or so, low 40s to 45%. And that, then definitely, I mean, when you look at a multiyear CAGR, I think, it does lead to calendar year 2020 to be approximately in low-30s or in that range, high-20s to low-30s kind of range in terms of calendar year 2020.","And I think what you have to realize is that with such aggressive pricing decline that had occurred in NAND over 2018 and 2019 timeframe, elasticity definitely has kicked in substantially, and as we said, pricing environment actually has started improving in NAND.","And some of the average capacity growth that you perhaps would have seen, next year actually has been pulled in faster into this year as a result of some of these aggressive price declines that have occurred and have driven the usage of higher capacities in terms of increasing average capacities of SSDs, increasing the attach rate of SSDs, as well as continuing to drive higher average capacities in the smartphone market as well.","So these are some of the factors that are absolutely playing an important role in terms of our assessment that for calendar year 2020 the year-over-year bit growth will be high-20s to low-30s range. Again, keep in mind that we still are few months away from next calendar year and we, of course, will continue to assess the overall industry demand trend, but this is our latest projection on that.","Your first question was around cloud, and let me just point out that, cloud definitely demand grew nicely for us on the DRAM side in FQ4. Strong demand increases. And yes, the cloud demand from time-to-time can be somewhat lumpy. However, overall demand growth trends on the cloud side continue to be solid.","In fact, we see cloud demand consumption both for DRAM as well as for SSDs continue to be higher than the average of the respective DRAM and the NAND industries. So overall, cloud again, new architectures, new CPU platforms that are really enabling more channels, as well as usage of higher density of DRAMs, as well as again, as I spoke earlier, the trend of AI applications all of this is driving greater usage of memory and storage in cloud.","So cloud, we see as absolutely strong. Cloud customers inventories have normalized and it's back to normal levels. Other than any aspects perhaps in China, as I talked about, of maybe some element of strategic inventory build by certain customers. But overall the cloud demand trends are solid.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to get back to NAND for fiscal 2020, and I just wanted to reconcile the comments you've made, and wanted to make sure I'm walking away with the right takeaway, is that you have limited cost down. And then you also talked about very low gross margin and then you're also selling from already built inventory. So what's the tradeoff between all these factors as I compare your profitability in NAND versus competition in fiscal 2020?","Sanjay Mehrotra","So I think in fiscal 2020 the main focus for us on NAND will be to continue to increase the mix of high value solutions. I think in mobile, you have seen us increase managed NAND solutions in terms of share gains substantially. And I\u2019ve reported in my prepared remarks on the tremendous progress that we have made with our mobile business, and most of it is driven by the progress on the managed NAND side and we plan to continue to increase that part of the business in fiscal year 2020.","I also spoke about SSDs, SSD was certainly a headwind in terms of share opportunities for us in fiscal year 2019. And as we now have expanded our portfolio of NVMe solutions actually have introduced our first NVMe solutions during fiscal year 2019. Now we can leverage those solutions to expand our opportunities in fiscal year 2020 and we certainly look forward to gaining share and assuming gaining share in SSD on fiscal year 2020.","So I think those are important pieces of our strategy of continuing to drive healthier revenue mix of NAND in fiscal year 2020. And of course, we are extremely focused on cost reductions on assembly, test and non-memory [bound] as well which are important factors particularly when it comes to products like SSDs or Multichip Packages, et cetera.","And we\u2019re making good progress on cost reductions on non-memory part of the [bound] as well. So these are all opportunities for us in fiscal year 2020. But no questions that at the die levels, our cost reduction capabilities will be overall limited in terms of the cost reductions due to the RG transition that we talked about earlier.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Moore, your line is open.","Joseph Moore","Yes. Hi, can you hear me?","Sanjay Mehrotra","Yes.","Joseph Moore","Yes. I wonder if you could talk about your forecasted demand will accelerate next year on the DRAM side, can you kind of break that down between units and content and just generally, what's your expectation for DRAM content per smartphones and service next year?","Sanjay Mehrotra","I think on the smartphone side, the average DRAM content if you look at it this year, it increased by nearly 25%, slightly above three was the average \u2013 3 gigabyte was the average capacity last year, expected to be in calendar year 2019 around 4.","And pretty similar double-digit gains continuing. 5G, if you look at Mobile World Congress, phones that were introduced there were 8 gigabyte and 12 gigabyte DRAM density in those phones. So as 5G phones start selling in the marketplace, some of those phones are already introduced in the market today in some parts of the world and this will continue to build momentum during calendar year 2020 and years beyond. Those phones will also require more DRAM.","And again the phones are becoming more and more feature-rich, more AI applications are being built into the smartphones today and rich video and imaging capability and lot more intelligence behind all those applications, they require more DRAM as well.","So looking at next year, we will certainly be seeing continuing average capacity increases next year as well. In fact, in calendar year 2020, if you look at industry projections, average capacity is expected to increase another 20% next year going to something closer to 5 gigabyte per smartphone.","But as I said before, the DRAM is not only about smartphone, its other applications related to server as well where the average content continues to increase, as well as the average content continues to increase in PCs as well with the applications such as gaming, driving higher need for more DRAM.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect."]}}
