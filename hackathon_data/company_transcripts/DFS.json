My name is Larissa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Bill Franklin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Larissa. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us on this afternoon's call. Let me start on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is on our website and we will be referencing during the call. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2012 and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the second quarter 2013 earnings materials, which are posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided financial -- we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms","Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. After the market closed, we reported quarterly diluted earnings per share of $1.20, up 21% over the prior year, driven primarily by loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated return on equity of 23% and returned approximately $440 million of capital to shareholders through repurchases and common dividends.","Our Direct Banking business again delivered strong results during the second quarter. Slide 4 of the earnings presentation shows Discover total loan growth at 6% over the prior year. This organic growth was driven by a 5% increase in card receivables and a combined 10% increase in private, student and personal loans.","Card receivables growth continues to outpace our primary peers. This strong growth was driven by increased wallet share with existing customers and also new accounts.","Discover it, our new flagship card product drove strong new account growth in the quarter, even while relying less on promotional balance transfers. Discover it's position in the market continues to be highly differentiated with superior customer value and service and the early results of our advertising campaign are positive. This campaign, Discover it, other card marketing initiatives, and our strength and rewards have not only helped us grow new accounts, but have also encouraged our large loyal customer base to spend and revolve with us.","Also in card, I want to announce that Discover has become the exclusive affinity card issuer for 5 universities, including the University of Nebraska. We are excited about the affinity channel for long-term new account and sales growth, as we leverage our cash rewards and customer service.","Next, I want to address the recent developments in our Payment Services segment. As Mark previously disclosed at an investor conference last month, we have been monitoring the economic situation in Europe and working with our Diners Club franchises during these tough times there. To minimize any disruption to cardholders and partners that rely on our network for international acceptance, we acquired the Diners Club franchise in Italy, are providing financial assistance to facilitate the acquisition of the Slovenian franchise by a European bank, and impaired certain loans to European Diners franchisees, all of which resulted in a segment pretax loss for the quarter.","To be clear, our international strategy remains unchanged. We are a global payments network that operates through local partners. However, the situation in Europe prompted us to selectively become more directly involved in what are primarily corporate card Diners Club franchises.","Payments segment year-over-year total dollar volume growth slowed as PULSE volume decreased by 3%. The debit environment remains dynamic and certain competitor actions are negatively impacting volume and revenue. Due to these developments at PULSE and Diners in Europe, as well as potential pressure on network partners volume as certain legacy contracts are rebid, the near-term outlook for Payment Services is more muted than our previous expectations.","During the second quarter, we announced a business-to-business payments partnership with Ariba, an SAP company. With this partnership, which is scheduled to begin in 2014, we will leverage our existing network infrastructure to facilitate low-cost B2B payments. Also after the quarter, we announced another Discover signature debit issuer. We believe that these and other recently signed partnerships collectively present significant long-term opportunities. However, I'd like to remind you that it will be some time before they have a meaningful impact on our quarterly results.","Overall, our results for the quarter were positive, as credit improved to an all-time low delinquency rate, card loans again grew faster than peers and net interest margin expanded.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, who will walk through the details of our second quarter results.","R. Mark Graf","Thanks, David and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start our discussion by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation.","Net interest income increased to $116 million or 9% over the prior year, driven by loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Net discount and interchange revenue increased by $35 million year-over-year or 13%, due to Discover card sales volume growth and a lower rewards rate.","The sequential decline in the rewards rate from 92 to 86 basis points was driven by the timing of promotional cash back programs. Going forward, you will likely see continued quarterly fluctuations in the rewards rate due to the timing of promotions, as we look to further engage our customers and to drive profitable sales. Our target rewards rate for the full year remains around 100 basis points.","Protection product revenue declined by $14 million over the prior year due to the discontinuation of new product sales in late 2012. Other income increased by $49 million primarily due to the inclusion of Discover Home Loans, which was launched in June 2012 and originated approximately $1 billion in direct mortgages during the quarter. We did see a slowdown in June as mortgage rates increased, which will impact origination volumes for the back half of the year. However, I would remind you that the mortgage product is relatively immaterial to our earnings.","Payment Services revenue decreased 8% year-over-year, mainly due to lower transaction processing revenue for PULSE.","Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.24% declined 21 basis points over the prior year, mainly due to card yield compression. This compression was split between an increase in promotional rate balances and a continued decline in higher-priced balances. Lower funding costs and lower-than-expected interest charge-offs more than offset this yield compression, resulting in a 16-basis-point increase in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.44%. We continue to expect net interest margin to expand somewhat in the second half of the year due to higher rate funding maturities, more than offsetting yield compression.","Let me take a moment to comment on interest rate sensitivity, as there's been a lot of questions on this topic in light of the recent increase in the 10-year treasury yield. Over the last several years, we've taken measured actions in our deposit book to reduce our repricing sensitivity and in the last 6-or-so months, we've begun to extend the maturities of our funding. This has resulted in a balance sheet that remains slightly asset sensitive.","Total operating expenses, as shown on Slide 7, were up $62 million, or 8% over the prior year. Marketing expenses were up by $64 million or 53%, due to initiatives that continue to drive new account growth, card utilization and loan growth, as well as the inclusion of our Direct Mortgage business this year. The 13% increase in employee compensation over the prior year was primarily related to the home loan launch and somewhat higher headcount in other areas of the business.","Other expenses were down $42 million or 23% lower than the prior year. You will recall that the second quarter of 2012 included a $90 million addition to legal reserves. This level of legal accruals did not occur in the second quarter of 2013, but we did realize $40 million in other expenses related to Diners in Europe.","Total pretax Diners charges were $55 million, which consisted of the $40 million I just mentioned plus $15 million in reserves established against loans to select European franchises. Due to these charges, as well as some additional investments that we'll be making in card marketing, we expect total company operating expenses to be somewhat greater than $3.2 billion for the full year.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses decreased $22 million from the prior year, driven primarily by lower charge-offs due to continued improvement in credit. The $78 million reserve release recorded in the quarter is net of the $15 million reserve build I noted a moment ago related to loans previously extended to certain European Diners franchises. Our outlook for -- our credit outlook for cards remains relatively stable. Sequentially, the card charge-off rate declined 2 basis points to 2.34% and a 30-plus day delinquency rate decreased 19 basis points to a new historic low of 1.58%.","The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, increased 76 basis points from the first quarter, due to both seasonality, as well as a larger portion of the portfolio entering repayment. The upward trend for the quarter was in line with our expectations and we should see the rate move back down next quarter. Student loan delinquencies, excluding acquired loans, continued to perform very well. They came in down 10 basis points sequentially to 1.38%.","Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was down 6 basis points sequentially and the over 30-day delinquency rate was down 12 basis points.","Before I move on to our capital position and 2013 outlook, I want to discuss our liquidity position. Our on-balance sheet liquidity portfolio at quarter end was $9.7 billion, $2.8 billion lower than the prior quarter and total available liquidity was $28 billion. Our liquidity portfolio decreased sequentially, as favorable capital markets conditions in the first quarter led us to issue term funding at attractive pricing levels to pre-fund second quarter maturities.","Moving to Slide 9, we ended the quarter with a 14.6% Tier 1 common ratio. In terms of the impact of Basel III, we're still digesting the voluminous rules, but our current expectation is that it will have an impact of approximately 10 basis points on the Tier 1 common ratio and the impact on the total risk-based capital ratio would be around 50, 5-0 basis points.","During the quarter, we repurchased $340 million of our stock and we expect to continue at roughly this pace over the remaining 3 quarters of this year's capital plan.","In summary, our overall results were strong with an ROE of 23% despite facing some challenges in our payments segment. Looking forward, the credit environment remains relatively benign, margin will increase from here in the back half of the year and we'll continue to remain disciplined with our investments for growth.","That concludes our formal remarks. And now, I'll turn the call back to Bill before we open things up to Q&A.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Mark. We will now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] If you have any additional questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Larissa, please start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, just a first question on expenses. So we're going from $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion, and I guess, obviously, some of that is related to the Diners charge. But how should we think about the reinvesting for growth opportunities here? I know you mentioned some more direct mail. But could we actually see -- how do we think about the payoff with these investments? Should we actually -- could we actually see growth coming in above your 2% to 5% target range given these investments that you're making at this point?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I think, Ryan, a couple things. You're right. Over half the increase we expect to see is coming out of the Diners onetime charges that we discussed in our prepared remarks a moment ago. The remainder of it is going to be increased marketing expenses. I guess when we sit and look at the performance we're delivering right now, we're out delivering in receivables growth both in terms of wallet share gains, as well as new customer acquisition. And the efficiency of our marketing spend right now is measured in terms of CPA, cost per account acquired, is about as good as we've ever seen it. And we're driving great ROE's through that all. So it seems to us like this is a pretty good time to continue to make hay while the sun shines, to reinvest, to compound the value of the business over time, and that's what we're doing.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then if I could ask one follow-up. Just, when you think about capital, I know you'd mentioned the current quarter's buyback as a good run rate. And If I run it through the model, that seems to see that you guys are going to continue to be accreting capital. And you're about to enter your first year as a CCAR bank. I guess the question I have is, does -- are you -- is there -- are you changing at all the way you're thinking about your appetite to use your capital in a more strategic way? I know historically you guys have done a lot of small deals and grown the businesses over time, but is there appetite for some small asset acquisitions increasing at this point, given your desire to leverage some of the excess capital?","R. Mark Graf","Ryan, I'd say we're always in the market looking for opportunities. I think the key take away I would have, is those have to be the right opportunities at the right price. And I've said it a number of times, we won't try and make deals that make sense, we won't try and make them make sense. So we're always out there looking. I would say, we clearly understand that our shareholders are looking for returns of capital and we're working diligently toward that end. And we'll also look for great opportunities to deploy it. So if we can find the right situations at the right prices, sure.","Operator","And our next question is from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So a couple of questions. One is on the outlook slide where you indicate credit outlook remains relatively stable. Could you just give us what that translates into, with regard to both NCOs and reserve, release or build or how you're thinking about that?","David W. Nelms","Well, Betsy, I'd say if you look at the record low 30-plus delinquency rate, that certainly bodes well for the future. And obviously, the reserve release during this quarter is indicative of an improved forward outlook for losses versus what we were expecting a quarter ago. But that being said, we think we're approaching a level where card charge-offs are about as good as they possibly can get. And so I certainly wouldn't be counting on a lot more reserve releases or for credit to trend much further from here. And I think what we described it as, is maybe some stability at this point, which would be a great thing.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, stability in the NCOs and then reserve, release just flipping to neutral, no release, no build? Or is there a build in the future?","R. Mark Graf","Betsy, I would say at this point in time, as dynamic as this environment is, and I think you've heard me say before, in 50 years of history as a credit card as a product, we've never seen a situation like we have today. And so the precision with which models predict is not as good as it would be in normal times. So I want to be a little bit hesitant to call terms here. One way or the other, I think what I'd say is, mathematically, there's only so much better credit could get, if it can improve. What we don't see at this point in time is we don't see any signs of a deterioration in the environment in our crystal ball, as we look to establish our reserves. So I would say that. And then I'd just remind you that we are generating some meaningful loan growth as well and at some point in time, that will cause us to return to a build-in provision even if the credit environment doesn't.","Operator","The next caller is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I'm going to ask a couple of questions right upfront. Just on the share buyback. I guess I'm a little surprised you guys are targeting a level of buyback that's not much higher than last year, yet fundamentals seem to be stronger. I was just wondering if you could just talk about the rationale and potentially, having the opportunity to amp that up a little bit more. And then second, on the NIM, I know, Mark, you said, the NIM probably is slightly higher in the second half. I'm assuming -- you're assuming a continued decline in the default bucket. And I think -- is it kind of safe to assume that, that bucket continues to pay down at this lower rate than what you've anticipated?","David W. Nelms","There's a bunch in there, Sanjay, I'll try and make sure I get it all. If not, come back at us here. But I would say first of all, with respect to the buybacks. I would say, history being revisited a little bit is the answer there, Sanjay, you have to plan the buy outs in terms -- the buybacks, in terms of payout ratios, and then you have to plan them in terms of dollars repurchased, not number of shares repurchased. So at the end of the day, credit has gotten better than we expected it to when that capital plan was filed and as a result, the payout ratios are lower than we expected them to be at the time that capital plan was filed. With respect to margin. I would say that there's a number of different factors that are kind of driving my thought process there. This quarter, it exceeded our expectations kind of on all fronts. Charge-offs of accrued interest were lower than we expected, funding costs were better than we expected, and the current yield came down less than we expected. A portion of that being slower attrition in that high rate bucket that you alluded to earlier. Looking forward, I would say we continue to see credit being relatively benign and funding costs, obviously, being a meaningful good guy here in the back half of the year.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on the share buyback. I mean, is there an opportunity to go back and potentially ask for more, given the improved outlook on credit?","R. Mark Graf","Theoretically, there is that ability to go back and ask for more. Sanjay, I would say, at this point in time, as close as we are to kicking off the cycle for the next capital planning process and the like, I think our judgment, our assessment, at this point in time, is we'll wait until the capital planning process comes back around again.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Maurer from CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I was hoping that you could provide a little more detail on what's going on in Europe. Are these banks or franchisees that you're supporting, I mean, are they looking to walk away from Diners without an increased level of support? And is this a drag we could see increase if Europe doesn't begin to start turning the corner any time soon? And secondly, is there anything that you could fathom from tomorrow's regulatory release that you could imagine impacting the Diners business?","David W. Nelms","Yes. I would say that we have a mix of bank and nonbank franchises in Europe. And some of them assumed the franchises after Citi exited, being the owner of the franchises and some of them have had some liquidity or funding challenges just as so many small businesses and businesses generally across Europe have had recently. And I couldn't generalize across Europe because we have some very strong major banks who are franchises in some countries and obviously, they don't need the same type of support even in the same environment. We, I'd say, this quarter, we certainly took the ones that were on the problem -- deepest on the problem list we dealt with this quarter. So we do think that this is a one-time, with respect to certainly this magnitude. But on a much smaller scale, we would certainly expect this to be an ongoing, but smaller, operational drag for some period of time in Europe. Now, Diners Club Europe is about 3% of our total payments volume and about half of that is corporate, a little over half of that is corporate volume, which may not be impacted by the recent legislation as much as credit and debit is likely. But we will certainly be spending some time understanding the impact of that on the general market in Europe. So bottom line is, I don't see Europe turning around real quickly, but I also don't see it being a major drag in the big scheme of things for Discover.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would just add to that one that of the total Diners volume, the volume sitting in troubled franchises is only about 5% of the total volume, so it's not significant.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Brendler from Stifel.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could just talk about the growth opportunity in credit cards as we go forward? Another solid quarter this quarter, it seems like you're doing a little better than the industry but just given the recent macro indicators, it seems like we have this potential for better organic growth. And I would also like if you could potentially give us any metrics or performance updates on your \"it\" campaign and how that's going.","David W. Nelms","Sure. Well, I think the most important growth measure for us is loan growth in cards and I'm pleased that we, once again this quarter, we're at the high end of our 2% to 5% year-over-year growth in card receivables. And against the backdrop of pretty much no growth in the industry, I feel very good about that. I think that when I think about the impact of \"it,\" I would most point you to that metric. Our \"it\" new accounts and campaigns are not the only thing driving loans up but they're certainly a very important factor. And I think the differentiation, the focus on rewards and service, I think, is paying off and is causing us to gain share in cards, even with a lack of loan growth in the market generally. So going forward, on the one hand, we're going to be dealing with some tougher year-over-year comparables for our loan growth in the next few quarters, but I certainly hope that we can stay towards the high end of that range. I have not yet seen statistics that show that the overall industry will really return to growth. If it did, that would obviously benefit us. But everything I see so far suggests, maybe, the deleveraging has stabilized or stopped. But I haven't seen anything that has turned around the other way to cause consumers to start growing credit card loans at this point.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up. Any material changes in the competitive environment? It seems like credit cards, despite the incredible returns you're generating across the industry now and record losses and low funding costs, competition doesn't seem to be anything more than it's been in the most recent history, relative benign. Any changes there and any comments you have on your balance transfer programs? It seems like it's relatively stable, I just want to make sure you're not seeing any changes there.","David W. Nelms","I'd say generally stable, competitive intensity. As we've said before, I think this year, we've seen -- and probably in the last few years, we've seen more intensity on the competition on rewards and reward cards, probably more so than people doing crazy things on either price or credit. And so certainly, I've been pleased with our ability to grow even while keeping our rewards cost at a reasonable level. With regard to balance transfer, one of the benefits of Discover it, is that we have been more focused on some of the differentiated features and the rewards program and the service levels. And while we certainly offer balance transfers, we're seeing a lot more retail activity and less balance transfer activity on those new accounts. And so I'd say that our growth is being driven more by non-balance transfer activities than it has been in the past, which is causing that percentage, that promo, to somewhat stabilize and that is in turn, somewhat helpful to the higher net interest margin that we reported today.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, if you look -- just add a little color to that, if you look at the year-to-date, the loan growth that we've posted, somewhat less than 40% of that loan growth has been related to balance transfers. The rest has all been standard merchandise.","Operator","The next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are with the PayPal initiative, if there's any update at all? And then also, card spend into July, has that been generally pretty steady from what you've seen in Q2?","David W. Nelms","Sure. Well, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on PayPal. We've signed over 50 acquirers and we're actually processing some transactions more on a test basis, but it's working. But there's still a lot of work ahead of us. We've got a lot of acquirers to sign, a lot of merchants to sign and board. And so this will take us some period of time before we see PayPal do their big launch and that will really be their decision as to exactly when. So progress, but a lot -- the majority of the work, I'd say, is still ahead of us. In terms of card spend. The last 6 or 7 weeks have been a bit encouraging, I guess, if I look at our volumes. We saw a little bit higher year-over-year growth in the last month of the quarter, which kind of contrasts from the first quarter where our best quarter was January -- or best month was January. So on the one hand, it feels like we might have a little more momentum building. On the other hand, you still see a lot of mixed economic data coming in, and so I think we'll need to see if that continues and really forms into a trend over the coming months.","R. Mark Graf","And Don, I think, just to add some metrics around what David was saying earlier. I think right now, we signed up a little bit, somewhat north of 50 acquirers in the PayPal transaction. And there's about somewhere north of 250,000 merchant outlets that are now accepting PayPal as well.","Operator","The next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wonder, could you talk a bit about the opportunity in Affinity? And kind of how does it -- how does what's being offered today compare to what was common when you were at another company in the past? Are the economics better for you today? Or are you offering rewards? Are you having to pay somebody to help you find partners?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think now that we're up to 6 Affinity groups, I'm not sure I would compare that so much to MBNA, which had thousands at one point. We're still in the early days here. I think certainly, the fact that you just saw us launch 5 more suggests that we're reasonably pleased with our first one, which was Ducks Unlimited last year. But I'd say we're going to take a measured approach. And I would say it will be quite some time before we see any material number of new accounts or growth coming from this channel. The vast majority of our marketing is going to continue to be \"it\" and then to it -- Discover it, and to a lesser degree, our gas and airline cards, some of the others. But over time, I think this could be an important channel for us. We've seen competitors really back away. We've seen a lot of dissatisfaction with service. And service and rewards are what we are very good at and is what is really important to Affinity groups. So I think we are entering, at this time, because there seems to be a real market demand and a fit with our skills. And we hope to gradually build this into a another leg to the marketing stool over time.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then could you just update us on where you stand you think, in terms of increasing merchant acceptance in the U.S.? Are you very far along, are there still lots of opportunities, do you think, or...","David W. Nelms","Well, obviously the opportunities are diminishing as we sign those holdout merchants. We -- I can't give you the name right now, but we just recently signed, probably the largest single holdout merchant. And by the end of this year, we'd hope to bring that merchant on board. And we continue to work with all the acquirers with some great activation and boarding programs to get, not only acceptance, but signage and activation of merchants. So it is something that I -- that we continue to focus very much on to close those last acceptance points. One of the newer sales pitches we have is frankly, the potential for some of the newer partners to provide more usage whether it's PayPal or next year, as we launch Ariba, obviously we'll be focused on some of the more business-oriented acceptance points that may have an interest, given Ariba's strength in that space. So I think leveraging all these new partners to get the -- those final outlets signed is something we're very focused on.","Operator","The next question is from Sameer Gokhale from Janney Montgomery Markets.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just had a question in terms of your provisions again. If I look back in Q4, I think the provisions were higher than expected, and you've given commentary on why those were lower, I think in Q1, there was some element of the newer vintages. As the seasons were coming on at lower losses than what you had originally expected. So as you think about your new accounts and you're booking them, the question I had was are you booking the provisions for those newer vintages to the newer lower curves, or are you allowed some sort of fudge factor, if you will, for lack of a better word, to take into account some of the uncertainty and the fact that we're in this low charge-off rate environment, as you think about your provisions for losses?","R. Mark Graf","I wish we could use more judgment, Sameer, on setting reserves than we're actually allowed to, but GAAP is prescriptive on this one for us, so we are setting them based on what actually our credit loss forecasting model shows us we should be expecting. So they continue to be better than we expected. That bump up in the fourth quarter was really because we thought we were expecting a bit of a return to normalcy over the course of this year at that point in time and that was factored into our models. Removing that when that became clear that, that was not indeed materializing. And that has resulted in where we are in right now. No, no, please go ahead.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just another question. Another topic was on your utilization rates. And it seems like, based on David's commentary also, it doesn't seem like there's much of a definitive styling of anything that consumers are levering up again or borrowing more and as you said, you're growing faster than the industry. But I guess the assumption would be that your utilization rates have not picked up. And when you price for your balance, your teaser rate offers and you think about utilization rates, I mean, do you assume a meaningful pickup in any of the utilization rates on those accounts, or are you being conservative there? Because I guess, the concern is that as these accounts roll off with a teaser, and you have some sort of assumption that utilization rates will pick up and the economics of those accounts would maybe improve over time. Those may not materialize. I mean, how do you think about utilization rates, given the kind of environment we are in at this point?","David W. Nelms","Well, you've got a lot in there. I think in terms of overall -- I don't see higher utilization rates right now in the industry. I'm not seeing total loan growth growing at this point. I think that if I look at Discover it, and that's where the vast majority, or most of our new accounts are coming from today, if I look at their utilization rates, they are actually markedly different than some of our previous vintages. And within that, I'm seeing higher activation rates, higher retail spending per account and lower balance transfer per account. And I would say that one of the things that we were counting on, that we tested last year with the product and then has borne out so far this year, is that we could get enough increase to activation and usage to be able to back off a bit on balance transfer and to offset some of the loss of income for some of the -- not repricing if someone goes delinquent or to post payments as current, if we get them by midnight through any channel. So less late fees. So it's a better value proposition for consumers and so there's higher utilization that we think will offset that. And we believe that is largely playing out, that we've got pluses and minuses. But on net, given what's going on in the industry, we have to gain share and we're doing that through a highly differentiated product in Discover it.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I'm trying to make sure that I understand all the commentaries surrounding the Diners charge. Mark, I thought that I'd heard you, when you've talked about it previously, kind of characterize it as one-time in nature. But David, I thought I'd heard you say during your comments tonight that you expect an ongoing operational drag from Diners in Europe. And then I guess when you combine that with the fact that you guys added a line item to the Payment Services segment called provision for loan losses, where, in the past -- it's a little bit kind of confusing to me because in the past, I've always looked at this as a line where there was no credit risk. And so I guess, when you put all that together, are we to kind of expect that there's going to continue to be a number here, going forward in future quarters for future reserve builds or future provision relating to this segment. Could you maybe just give some commentary around that?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, no problem, Bill. I guess what I would say is a couple of things. Number one, the $55 million charge we're taking this time is clearly one-time in nature. And I would say, is there an operating expense drag associated with bringing these franchises on to our books, Italy and the processor that comes along with Italy on to our books at this point in time, the answer is yes. There's a very modest operating drag. I would say it's not material to DFS overall, which is why we specifically have not called it out. But there will be a modest operating drag associated with that. The line item that showed up in the Diners P&L or the payments P&L that you're specifically referring to is not related to consumer or corporate credit extensions to cardholders. It's related specifically to the loans we had extended to those franchisees when they began encountering difficulty, to try and get them over the hump, as it were. So that was the thought process behind that and that's what those are related to. I guess the best way I can help you size it is again, to say that yes, there's a modest run rate drag, but it's not material to DFS overall. There's about $40 million more of these loans outstanding roughly and that's it. So that's a very modest number as well. And I would anchor you back to that only about 5% of the total Diners volume is sitting in franchises we consider to be troubled today. So are there a couple of European challenges around Diners? Yes, you bet there are. It is something that's going to materially drive our run rate earnings profile in a bad direction going forward? No, I don't see that either.","David W. Nelms","To be clear, Mark, I think the $40 million -- $40 million gross loans, of which we've impaired $15 million.","R. Mark Graf","That's correct. That is correct, thank you for the clarification.","David W. Nelms","So that's not a huge net.","R. Mark Graf","That's correct. Thank you, David, I appreciate that clarification, yes.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then I guess the other question I had was within student -- private student lending. We saw delinquency rates went down, but we saw a little bit of an increase in charge-off rates, both excluding PCI and as well as just the reported rate. Can you talk a little bit about that? And could you give a little bit of commentary on -- there was an article that I saw about you guys giving -- expanding cardholder access to free ATMs. Maybe if you could just comment a little bit on that and that's it.","R. Mark Graf","I'll cover off on the student loan one, then I'll punt the ATM issue over to David to address. I guess what I'd say is a couple of different things taking place in the private student loan space. I guess, first of all, we typically tend to see an uptick in losses in the charge-off rate from the second -- from the first quarter into the second. You can see, if you look back last year, that occurred as well. What you have is an element of as these loans come out of deferral and then come in to a repayment period, you begin to see a lumpiness factor of that. A number of those folks will come back current again at some point in time. But you also recognize you take the majority of the losses, you take, on a student loan account in the first 2 years after that loan comes out of deferral. So as we have a portfolio that's seasoning, what we've said is that we expect the loss rates to rise up above 1%. They'll come back down over time. So our expectation is, yes, the charge-off rate spikes. It's our clear expectation. You'll see that come back down again meaningfully next quarter. But losses overall, we'll continue above that 1% level until we reach a stabilized level in the organically originated portfolio. And David, I'll kick it to you for the ATMs.","David W. Nelms","Yes. And you may recall that earlier this year, we launched Discover Cashback Checking. And with no minimums and cash rewards on debit, bill pay and checks written. And in doing so, one of the features we had is we have access to a full million ATMs around the globe on our network. But within that, we announced that we were establishing a network of no-fee cash advance or cash access locations. And these are ones that we don't charge an ATM fee anywhere, but these are ones where the ATM operator also doesn't charge any, so there's no fee at all to the consumer. Allpoint, we've just added, was -- I think Allpoint announced it themselves yesterday, this week. And they -- that one is the largest single network and it's combined now with another network we had already signed. And so together, we're going to be able to -- we are able to offer our customers access to a larger network nationwide of no-fee ATMs than even the largest single traditional branch bank in the country offers. So I think it's a very -- makes it's a very competitive offering and we will look forward to growing that checking account product in our current customer base this year. And I look forward to sometime next year, launching it broadly to customers beyond the current Discover cardholder base.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Bruce from Bank of America.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I would like to revisit capital management. I realize, we're at risk of beating a dead horse, but it's an important issue. Discover continues to have a very high capital ratio. You're accumulating capital at a very good pace, just given that credit is good and it looks like it's going to remain that way for a while. I guess, understanding you're not going to go back in to see if you can top up the buyback this year. Do you think that as you think about the capital plan for 2014, there's an opportunity to be more aggressive in terms of what the payout rate would look like? Do you think that the environment is such that, that has a good likelihood? Or do you think that you have to look at other strategic uses of capital in -- specifically around M&A? what types of properties would you be most interested in looking at that would absorb the excess capital?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. Ken, I would say, I think as we look to the capital plan, yes, we will look to be more aggressive than we were this year, would be our hope and our thought process. I would say the plan itself, we were more aggressive than we're actually realizing. I think there's 2 things. Number one, credit has gotten better than we expected it to and lasted -- that trend has continued longer than we expected it to. And number two, our stock prices had a great rise as well, associated with it. So given that you have to plan payouts in dollars as opposed to payout ratios, there's been some constraining factor there. So we have not been able to achieve what we had filed and hoped to achieve, quite honestly. Just to be abundantly clear about it. Going forward, it would be our clear expectation that we will learn from our mistakes. We did better at it this year than we did the year before, but we clearly have room to do even better at it next year, would be my general sense. Then kind of talking about the M&A side of the equation, I guess what I'd do is I'd just kind of reiterate my prior comments. I think when you start getting too excited about M&A is when you can make a lot of mistakes. Discipline is the keyword around this place when it comes to M&A. So I would say, if we found the right opportunity, and that right opportunity was priced correctly, we would be as intrigued as we ever were to pursue that opportunity. But it would have to fit strategically, it would have to financially make sense. What we won't do is stretch to make something make sense just because we have some excess capital.","David W. Nelms","And if I could just add, Ken, I think if you look at the fact that we actually took 6% of our share count out over the last year and increased our dividend from $0.14 a quarter to $0.20 a quarter, I don't think you see too many companies in financials who have actually had that level of impact with our current capital management. And I mean, I guess, it's a nice problem to have. And maybe we wish we had done even more, but it's a pretty strong record of capital return.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes -- no, that's not meant to be a critique in any way. In fact, I think it\u2019s very much a unique scenario that you have in front of you, just in terms of how things have played out on the credit front. And these situations obviously have another, there's element here in terms of the decision-making, in terms of what can get approved. And I was trying to get a sense if you thought that the environment was one that you would be able to take up that payout ratio or not. It's not meant as a critique, I think you've got a huge opportunity. I'm just wondering if the environment is ripe to take advantage of that. So that's really...","R. Mark Graf","Clearly, the current horizontal review process does not especially favor folks who enter it with excess capital. Let's put it that way and we're going to work diligently to try and increase the returns.","Operator","The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But one of the topics that you did talk about, David, that maybe you could revisit a little bit, is this idea of competition. I mean, you mentioned, actually, that strong balance growth, the industry is kind of maybe getting a little better but still not anywhere near where you guys are at an attractive cost per account and less reliance on balance transfer. I mean, anything else that you can kind of talk to? Because I mean, you don't -- every single day, you see another kind of cashback card being thrown out there. So what -- how have you been able to achieve that? I mean, it seems like an even -- I guess, an even better performance given the backdrop.","David W. Nelms","Well, thank you, we're proud of it. I would say that number one, we focus very hard on being the leader in cash even though there's a lot more people in the space. And I'd say, the other thing is there's a lot of execution beyond cashback bonus, providing great service because it's a lot easier to grow when you're not losing people out the back end. Having very strong credit environment process to make the right credit decisions on the front end and I think, even the execution of our advertising campaign, our sponsorships of the NHL and college football, all of these things work together. And I think the thing that we're focused on is not just executing for today, but planting seeds for tomorrow. And so you're seeing us tiptoe a bit into the Affinity market and do some things that we think will help us to continue to be able to gain market share over the long term. Not standing still, but being an innovator.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe just to follow up quickly. I mean, what would you consider a success over 2 to 3 years, from the Affinity channel? I mean, how would you kind of think about framing that?","David W. Nelms","I would not venture on anything on that. We're still in the early days. I mean, we're in Affinity group #6. And so, I mean, we wouldn't have done it if we didn't think that it couldn't be important over the long term. I would think more about what it could be over a 5-year term. And I think over a 5-year term, we have some good aspirations for it. But I think, this year or next year, it's not going to make much difference. Discover it is going to be it.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I have one question on the rewards element. And I know you've given commentary about the sort of 1% or 100 basis points for the full year. But just trying to understand how much of the volatility in the rewards level is driven by the 5% rewards program that rotates through every quarter. Is that a big chunk of it? Or do you have just a whole portfolio of rewards programs that cause the number to move around?","David W. Nelms","It is, in fact, promotional rewards that causes volatility. As you would expect, the underlying programs are quite stable quarter-to-quarter. And the 5% is our biggest single promotional aspect. We have others related to new accounts. We have programs with individual merchants and special redemptions, so there's a host of promotional activity designed to try to get people to make Discover their primary card, to use us in categories that they may not be using us in historically. And so that will cause it to fluctuate and as you'd expect, we tend to have more of those promotions around the holiday season, which is one reason you see, generally, a little lighter time in the second quarter and a little bit heavier in the second half this year -- of the year.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And then just one quick one on the home loans. I understand we're in a different mortgage environment. Can you talk a little bit about the flexibility you have on the expense side on that business in a different rate environment?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I think, like all kilty [ph] businesses, there's a much greater degree of flexibility in some of those businesses than there is in others. I would remind you that for us, this is a pretty small business at this point in time and we are building it up for what we want it to be as opposed to having been feeding at the trough and now looking to pare back expenses. So I think we'll be prudent managers. As it relates to that, we definitely have some flexibility. But I wouldn't think we would be taking actions to the magnitude that some of our competitors have, shall we say.","Operator","The next question comes from Rick Shane from JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a little bit of a strategy question. The structural changes that we've seen over the last couple of years seem to be driving down loss rates through lower frequency of default, as opposed to severity of default. Given that trend and what you guys are seeing, do you feel comfortable widening the credit funnel just a little bit? Because it seems that for each borrower who's out there, the probability of default seems to be structurally changed.","David W. Nelms","Well, certainly, the lower frequency has been the bigger driver, although the average losses also declined over time. And I would say that where we can find pockets of being able to approve people for accounts that we think will produce the right returns and the right loss characteristics over time is a dynamic process, and we're always fine-tuning those models. But I would say we're also being cautious because we know that losses will not remain this low forever. And -- but yet, we're going to need to live with our credit decisions today for a long, long time. Especially given the fact that we tend to retain our customers for a long, long time. So we are not just going to reduce our credit standards to try to get the overall losses back up to the level they used to be. Instead, I think that there will be a new lower level of losses in the industry and in our company and it's a little hard to tell exactly what that is, but it's certainly lower than history.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I apologize if I missed this during your prepared remarks, but could you discuss the decline in the transaction processing revenues? Was that related to the merchant routing competitor actions that you referred to? And if so, is there a potential for a little bit more of a decline in that as the kind of actions of your competitors kind of shake out?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think that PULSE has gone through a period of great share gains and growth over the last 6 or 7 years, generally. But I think we are, right at the moment, in a much more challenging time because of some of the rules tying PIN, debit and signature together. Some of the pricing strategies are fixed and variable, designed to really benefit a 70% market share player. And we are doing our all -- absolute best to maintain volumes and margins. But we're going to continue to be under assault here for a while. We've got an awful lot of strategies. I was real pleased that we announced our second signature issuer this quarter. And so -- being the only PIN network that also has a signature strategy and being able to compete in signature, which represents about 2\/3 of the total U.S. debit volume, I think is an important part of that strategy. But focusing on our individual pricing, the partnerships, how can we add value, working with issuers, working with acquirers, working with merchants, we're going to be pulling all those levers, but I do not -- I do expect PULSE's volume to be down year-over-year. And that's the first time we've been in that position, probably, since we bought the company. But what we're focused on doing is turning things back to a growth opportunity for the longer term.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then a second question. It looks like the protection products revenues stabilized, at least Q-over-Q. Has that bottomed here, or is there still room for a little bit more attrition in that revenue?","R. Mark Graf","I would expect you'll see continued attrition in that revenue. In the first quarter, I think it was a little bit greater than we expected because there were some customer refunds that were issued in addition to the impact from the discontinued sales. But we've got a big interest [ph] trading book. And since we discontinued sales, the top of the funnel was not being refilled, if you will. So we would expect that over time, as cancellations occur or as deaths occur, whatever the case might be. That book will begin to attrite until such point in time as we make a decision about reentering the marketplace.","Operator","The next question comes from James Friedman from SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","David, I just wanted to follow up in your response to that prior question. With regard to the trends at PULSE and the fixed versus variable fee among your big competitor, would you consider legal or injunctive relief to try and pursue some remedy, relative to their pricing strategy? And I have a quick follow-up after that.","David W. Nelms","Well, I'm not -- I would say that we certainly look at all of our options. I think the primary focus is doing everything we possibly can do from a competitor perspective and that's where our -- that's where our primary attention is.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So just to finish that. Do you anticipate that the Department of Justice inquiry in this very area will lead to some relief for PULSE?","David W. Nelms","I couldn't speculate on what the Department of Justice may or may not do.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then as a related, but slightly separate question, Mark, the Payment Services expenses on Slide 7 did accelerate this quarter. I'm sorry if I misheard this, or if you didn't reference it. But it did increase in excess of the decline in the revenue, I was just wondering if there was some more color on that, the $37 million going to $86 million?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, that's going to be the charges related to Diners. The one-time charges that we're taking this quarter that are flowing through that segment of the P&L.","David W. Nelms","It was around $40 million in operating expenses.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The growth rate in consumer loans seemed to pick up a little bit this quarter. And you also talked about entering the home equity market. And so I was wondering if you can maybe give a little bit of an update on the consumer loan business and your thoughts. Why did it accelerate this quarter? And then your thoughts around entering home equity.","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that, kind of what I said before, I mean, we're at the high end of the range on card growth that we had expected. And I'd be thrilled if we can maintain it at close to the high end of that range. I'm not sure that I would, at this point, count on it accelerating beyond the growth track. And the fact that we're the fastest-growing of the major card issuers, if we can hold this kind of level, I'd be really pleased. With respect to home equity, we do expect to enter that business next quarter. And I wouldn't expect that to be a big contributor to loans this year. But certainly, it should be a contributor next year.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","David, I thought my -- maybe I misspoke. I thought -- now at the consumer loan business, I wasn't -- I didn't mean credit cards. The acceleration -- sorry...","David W. Nelms","I'm sorry, personal loans. Personal loans, yes, we have seen great results in that business and certainly, there's still a good number of consumers who want to consolidate and pay down debt, which is the primary focus of that product. You can see in the credit metrics that it's performing very well for us. And so we did intentionally make some additional investments to grow that business a little bit faster. And I was pleased with the results this quarter.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And you expect that to continue?","David W. Nelms","I expect it to continue to be the highest percent year-over-year growth of our loan businesses for some period of time.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Then last question. Could you just remind us -- remind me what the primary differentiators are for the \"it\" product? And how unique it is and how sustainable that advantage is?","David W. Nelms","Well, I'd encourage you to go on our website and apply and experience it yourself. One of the things about Discover it is that there's a whole page of differentiating features. So that's why I can't just say, \"Well, it's these 2 things.\" There's a whole series of them starting with the great rewards program, including lower fees, higher service and even a cool look for the card and how it's delivered. And it's a total package of differentiated features and one of the things that we tend to use in our marketing materials is one that shows how each feature compares to a bunch of major competitors. And there's a few that are unique across all competitors, but there's a bunch where only one other competitor has it. So the fact that we've sort of brought some unique and some the best of everything is how we designed it and why I think the appeal is so great for consumers today.","R. Mark Graf","And Bob, if you go out to our Investor Relations website and pull down the Investor Day deck, the page that David is referencing is contained in that deck.","Operator","The last question is from Daniel Furtado from Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just had a cursory question on recoveries. It seems like recoveries are beginning to trend down the last couple of months, but we're still way above historic levels. I assume as we move further away from the bulk of charge-offs and the crisis that we can expect that to come down a little bit more. And I know you haven't typically sold those charge-off loans. But can you give us a sense of kind of the magnitude or the duration of the expected normalization of recoveries?","David W. Nelms","Well, that last point you mentioned is important, that we don't sell our recoveries. And that's one of the reasons the recovery stream has held up better because we didn't sell them and recognize a gain a few years ago like almost all of our competitors did. But certainly, as we move further and further away from the crisis and the peak of our charge-offs, we will have less and less inventories and those will be older. And so we certainly expect recoveries to diminish over time because charge-offs are so low now, we're simply not adding fresh charge-offs to that inventory, that could lead to recoveries.","Operator","We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Franklin.","Bill Franklin","Thanks, Larissa. As a reminder, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening if you guys have any additional questions.

My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin. You may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us on this morning's call. Please note that for the first time, we have provided an earnings presentation on our website, which we will be referencing during the call.","Let me start on Slide 2. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2012, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","As previously reported, the company changed its fiscal year-end from November 30 to December 31. For more information, including historical calendar year financials, please see the 8-K dated March 5, 2013.","In the first quarter 2013 earnings materials, which are posted in our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'll start my remarks on Slide 3 of our new earnings presentation.","Before the market opened, we reported quarterly diluted earnings per share of $1.33, up 10% over the prior year, driven primarily by loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated a return on equity of 27% and returned approximately $310 million of capital to common shareholders through repurchases and dividends. These positive results, our capital position and our outlook, led our board to approve a 43% increase in our dividend to common shareholders last week. Mark will provide you with more details about our financial performance for the first quarter, but I'd like to draw your attention to Discover's year-over-year revenue growth of 10%. This shows how the Discover business model is working, especially since the financial industry as a whole currently is an environment that poses challenges for achieving revenue growth. So we will continue with investments to drive topline growth.","Slide 4 of the earnings presentation illustrates some of the drivers behind our revenue growth. We achieved 7% organic receivables growth, driven by a 5% increase in card receivables and a combined 10% increase in private, student and personal loans. Car sales volume for the quarter was up 4%. We did continue to focus on prime revolver sales, and we believe these results underscore the effectiveness of that strategy.","On the Payment side, the year-over-year total volume growth slowed down to 2% as PULSE's growth rate decelerated from 11% for the fourth quarter to 4% year-over-year for the first quarter. This deceleration in growth was something we discussed in prior calls and was mainly due to the impact of merchant routing and competitor actions, as well as our focus on profitable business rather than just volume growth. While the environment remains dynamic, we are pursuing a number of strategies that we expect will enable us to compete for a larger share of debit transactions and continue to grow this business going forward.","Looking beyond debit, during the quarter, we signed our first net-to-net partnership in Africa, and we are making strong progress as we continue to prepare for Paypal's staged offline rollout this year. At Diners, volumes were impacted by the continued weakness in Europe and strengthening of the dollar versus other currencies like the yen.","Last month, our management team presented Discover's strategic priorities and key initiatives at our annual Financial Community Briefing in New York. We discussed our profitable growth, the credit environment, our successful expansion beyond credit cards and our commitment to effective capital management. We also shared exciting new opportunities, including the nationwide rollout of Discover it, which so far is driving strong response rates and an enhanced engagement from new accounts. Discover it was not the only new product we launched this quarter. We also launched Cashback Checking. While these new initiatives are in early days, I'm very excited about how they will shape the future of Discover.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he will walk through the details of our first quarter results.","R. Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start our discussion this morning by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation.","Net interest income increased $118 million or 9% over the prior year, driven by asset growth and a higher net interest margin. Net discount and interchange revenue increased by $23 million year-over-year or 10% due to Discover card sales volume growth and a lower rewards rate. The timing of promotional Cashback programs drove most of the sequential decline in our rewards rate from 111 to 92 basis points. For the full year, our target rewards rate remained at approximately 100 basis points. However, you will likely see continued quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of promotions as we look to further engage our customers and to drive profitable sales.","Protection product revenue declined by $15 million over the prior year and $10 million sequentially, mainly due to the discontinuation of new product sales, as well as customer refunds. We don't currently believe this sequential decline is representative of an accelerating runoff rate, but do think there may be some quarterly fluctuations going forward.","Other income increased by $59 million, primarily due to the inclusion of Discover Home Loans, which was launched in June of 2012. In terms of production, we originated approximately $1 billion in direct mortgages for the quarter. Payment Services revenue increased 6% year-over-year due to higher-transaction processing revenue for PULSE and higher revenue from network partnerships.","Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.22% declined 17 basis points over the prior year, mainly due to card yield compression. This compression resulted from an expected increase in promotional rate balances, as well as an expected decline in higher-priced balances. Lower funding cost and lower-than-expected interest charge-offs more than offset this yield compression, resulting in a 30 basis point increase in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.39%. We continue to expect some NIM compression next quarter and then margin should expand sequentially in the second half due to maturities of higher rate funding.","Operating expenses, as shown on Slide 7, were up $81 million or 12% over the prior year. Over half of the expense increase is due to higher employee and marketing costs associated with the Home Loan acquisition and the launch of our Direct Mortgage product last June. Marketing expense was also higher than the prior year due to investments that continue to drive new account growth, card utilization and loan growth.","Other expenses were lower than the prior year mainly due to fluctuations in reserves related to legal and regulatory matters. Payment Services' operating expenses were up $6 million or 18% over the prior year, mainly due to higher professional fees and marketing expenses related to new partnership and growth initiatives. As David and I mentioned last quarter, this will be an investment year for payments. We're working on a number of different opportunities that will depress profits in the segment near term, but which we believe will position us for volume and revenue growth over the longer term. As mentioned during our financial community briefing, we still expect total company operating expenses of roughly $3.1 billion for the full year.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses increased $75 million in the prior year, driven by a lower reserve release for the first quarter, which was partially offset by lower charge-offs. Our forward loss forecast, particularly for seasoned credit card vintages, improved since fourth quarter earnings. Accordingly, the first quarter of this year had a reserve release of $154 million, which I would emphasize should not be used as a run rate. Net principal charge-offs were down $45 million or 13% year-over-year due to continued improvement in credit. Sequentially, the credit card net charge-off rate increased 5 basis points to 2.36%, and the 30-plus day delinquency rate decreased 2 basis points to a new historic low of 1.77%.","The Student Loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchased loans, decreased 18 basis points from the fourth quarter due to seasonal and growth in the portfolio. We would remind you that as the portfolio seasons, we expect this charge-off rate will rise above 1% and come back down over time to our normalized target of approximately 1%. The over 30-day delinquency rate increased 26 basis points sequentially. The credit performance of both our organic and purchased credit-impaired student loan portfolios continues to be in line with our expectations. The personal loan net charge-off rate was down 17 basis points sequentially, and the over 30-day delinquency rate was down 1 basis point.","Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our Tier 1 common ratio increased sequentially by 110 basis points to 14.7% due to the combination of strong earnings, sequentially lower share repurchases and the seasonal decline in receivables in the fourth quarter. As was previously announced on March 14, Discover received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve for proposed capital object -- actions for the four quarters, which we began on April 1. Additionally, our board authorized a 2-year, $2.4 billion share repurchase program, and last week, increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.14 to $0.20 per share.","With respect to longer-term capital planning, we anticipate being part of the Fed's CCAR review process next year. Having compared peer reported stress results to those calculated by the Fed in this year's process, we believe that our target capital ratio may increase as we become a part of the CCAR process. Despite the prospects of a potentially higher Tier 1 common target, we still have more than adequate levels of capital to drive organic growth and planned capital actions in the current environment.","In summary, this was a great way to start the year. We drove better-than-industry revenue and receivables growth, credit performance remained strong and we received non-objection from the Fed on our January 2013 capital plan.","That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Vanessa, to open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Craig Maurer.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I had a question about network volume. For many quarters, you've been talking about share gains in the network business, not just PULSE, but Discover Network as well. And it seems, at minimum, you've fallen back to the growth rates of the 4-party systems and are now lagging the other major 3-party network. Do you expect that to recover with the launch of 'it'? Are there other initiatives you can take? Or should we expect more of a lagging position from Discover Network now versus some of the other networks?","David W. Nelms","Well, certainly, we've had a great track record over the last 5 years or so of gaining share. It hasn't all been even. We've gone through some periods of gaining significant share and some much less. And if you look at the -- what's going on, there's not a big change in the Discover side. It's primarily debit, where PULSE has been gaining very significant share. And as we had suggested in prior quarters, some of the trends that we're seeing were concerning, some of the new rules and approaches coming out of some of our competitors, as well as some routing changes post-Durbin. And I still do expect in the long term to be in a share gain position. And I'm particularly excited by some of the new net-to-net partnerships, Paypal and others, as well as the actions that we're taking within PULSE to confront some of the competitive challenges. As Mark suggested, we are in an investment mode pursuing some of these great new opportunities, which I think will pay huge dividends over the long term, but I'm not expecting to have big share gains. We obviously didn't have it this quarter, and I wouldn't expect it probably in the next 1 or 2 quarters. But we'd look forward to returning to gaining share again as soon as we can.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And if I could follow up on Paypal, are you planning to aid Paypal in their marketing efforts? Or will this be strictly a Paypal effort in terms of actual consumer-focused marketing?","David W. Nelms","Consumer marketing will be Paypal's responsibility. We are focused on the acceptance side.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Nash.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, just on credit and the reserve, losses continue to come down nicely. I believe you mentioned due to the seasonal loans, and the reserve also came down. Can you just help us understand the path from here? Any changes to your expectations over the next year? And given all the initiatives you have on the lending side, can we continue to see the reserve come down at this point? Or is all the provision [ph] that you're going to be doing from here strictly related to growth that you're generating?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, there's a lot in there, Ryan. I'll try and touch on it all and if I miss anything, feel free to hit me with your follow-up. But I guess what I would say is, that credit continues to surprise to the positive. And I guess that's a great thing, at the end of the day. It validates the underwriting we've done and the strength of the book. I would say, I would not take this quarter's run rate on a release or anything even approximating it and say that's what the -- kind of the future is going to look like, and you should extrapolate that out. I guess, what I'd say specifically is, at this point in time, it's really too early to call if next quarter is going to represent a release or a build. I think it's a continually evolving situation where in 50 years of the existence of a credit card as a product, the models are all built off that history and we've never seen an environment like this. So I think everybody in the industry is, to some degree, figuring this out as we go. We feel good about the positioning, and we feel good about where we are. In terms of the trajectory right now, I'd say next quarter could go either way.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just on the buyback, Mark, I know that at Investor Day you talked about getting the payout close to 100% or at least that's cap, the way the Fed is thinking about it. If I look at expectations over the next few quarters, it implies a buyback of something around $500 million a quarter or so. When you think about the 2-year program, given that you used 70% of last year's allotment, is it feasible that we could see greater utilization on this year's $2.4 billion plan, just given the significant amount of earnings that you're generating at this point?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I mean, I don't think at this point in time I'm going to give guidance on exactly where we expect to end up. I guess what I'd say, Ryan, is we -- we're generating great returns on that excess capital. And we don't -- so we don't feel like we're being irresponsible in that regard. And we bought back 6% of our outstanding shares last year and popped our dividend 43% last week. So I think we're trying to navigate a healthy balance between deploying that capital into the business to drive compounding of value and profitable growth over the long haul, as well as making sure we don't just start building some giant capital hoard. I guess, what I would say is that it is a 2-year authorization and I wouldn't expect we would, over the rolling 4 quarters from where we sit right now, I wouldn't expect we'd approach utilizing that $2.4 million (sic) [$2.4 billion].","Operator","And we have our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So when I look at marketing, it seemed like it was a little bit lighter than what I had anticipated and kind of what you guys were guiding to. I was wondering if you could just talk about if there was any change to the competitive landscape that caused a little bit of variance there? I think one of your competitors mentioned where the growth has really been is in the high-balance revolvers. And I was just wondering if you could just maybe even talk about that and specifically kind of where your growth is coming from versus what you've typically originated in the past?","David W. Nelms","Sure. First, our marketing was certainly higher in the cards this -- first quarter this year than it was 1 year ago. And I think if you look around, you've seen probably plenty of billboards, TV spots and so on; I think we've really gotten the word out, and we've done it in a cost-effective way. I think during the first quarter with the launch of Discover it, we probably went a bit heavier on some of those broad market approaches because in the test markets, they worked very well. But I'd say we're also now following up with a bit heavier mail. And I would expect to see our direct mail volumes be a bit higher for Discover it in the second quarter versus the first as we continue to make consumers broadly aware of this great product and grow our business. In terms of where our growth is coming from, I'd say it's quite balanced. There's still a good amount of our growth that comes from current customers and gaining market share, retaining them, not writing them off, and so that's a big part of it. I'd say Discover it is attracting a slightly different usage pattern, a little bit less balance transfer, a little bit more retail sales, higher activation, and if anything, skewing a bit better in terms of the credit expectations. So that will take quite some time given the size of our book to work its way in. But I guess, overall, our growth has been quite balanced, and we're going to continue to ramp up our marketing on Discover it.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, just one follow-up for Mark. Mark, you just talked about your targeted level of capital going up under CCAR. Can you just talk -- or could you help quantify how much of a change you might be anticipating? And kind of could you just also talk about why that would go up under CCAR versus CapPR?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would say that we don't, Sanjay, definitively know that it will go up, is the key point. I think what we've seen is, we've compared the same thing you all have, and that is, we've looked at in the CCAR where there's total transparency, we've looked at what the BHCs themselves submitted as their expected losses and hits to pre-provision net revenue. And we've seen the stress cases that the Fed came back with. And I think some of our customers have talked about -- or some of our competitors rather, have talked about that disconnect. I think we clearly see a pretty significant disconnect there. We're just being -- trying to be responsible and say, \"Hey, look, as we're looking at this, we feel compelled to tell the market, this may impact us, too.\" So I think we're just trying to level set that. In terms of what the impact may be, I know this isn't the answer you want to hear, but it's the God's honest truth, and that is, we won't know until we go through the CCAR process ourselves, because they don't disclose how this is being done and it changes every year. But I think the key point to take away is, in my prepared remarks, one of the things I was very cautious to say is, we don't envision any of this impacting our current planned capital actions. So I'd say, it's a bit of an academic point at some level because getting back -- getting down to that target capital ratio, as we discussed with you before, was going to be a multi-year process anyway. And it isn't going to impact us near term; we just felt compelled to put it out there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","Just as we think about credit, you referenced the bankruptcy benefit in the press release. Can you just talk through kind of where bankruptcy filings are coming out? Is it just the number of bankruptcy filings are coming out lower than you had forecast or dollars per bankruptcy, or what exactly is happening there?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think that total bankruptcy filings in the country has been trending down a bit, which is different than what a number of forecasters externally had been predicting just a few months ago. And within that, our share of Discover customers who have -- who are part of those bankruptcy filings has also remained quite modest. And so it's part of the credit favorability that we've talked about earlier on the call.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","And then on the net interest margin, you had a nice slide at the Analyst Day on the high-cost CD and fixed-rate ABS rollovers. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what the go-to rates are on average for CDs, and I guess on ABS; kind of whether you're replacing the fixed-rate or floating rate ABS, so we can try to think about what the funding cost benefits might be over the next couple of quarters?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I guess what I can say is, from the standpoint of the deposits, I'd encourage you to just go out and hit our website. Our posted rates are out there. And you can get a good sense and a good approximation on the deposit side of the equation where we're replacing those roles today. With respect to the ABS market, I'd point you to our most recent print in terms of how we're looking at life, where we're doing a multi-tranched approach. We're managing the balance sheet holistically, not incrementally. So the asset liability position is -- takes into account a number of different factors obviously. And we're tranching out some of this with longer-dated, fixed-rate ABS. We're also keeping it somewhat relatively shorter-dated. So I know that's not a direct, specific answer to the question. But if you need some further follow-up, we'll be happy to help you on that as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One of the questions that I keep getting is on teasers. And you did indicate and you've talked before about the fact that you're doing teasers, ramping them up. I guess, I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of how you're managing the credit around the teasers? And also could you give us an update on how much of the teasers that you're bringing in you're able to transfer into multiproduct or extended product-type of customers that helps you get a sense of what their payment history is like?","David W. Nelms","Sure. Well, I mean, we're up modestly from last year. We were around 16% last year. We're around 18% now, and I expect it to be pretty stable from this point forward. And I'd say from a -- we obviously do it because our net present value say that it's the right thing to do. That we look at all the different factors, how many stay with us, the credit aspects and so on. From a credit perspective, generally speaking, if you offer customers a lower rate, you get better credit. So a higher percent, and the fact that we're in the prime business, means that we use it more than someone who's not fully in the prime business. So I'd say, generally speaking, what you're seeing with us is consistent with our previous guidance, is probably elevated today versus what it might be in a different cost of funds environment, because that obviously goes into the -- all the models and is being done to maximize returns and is indicative of a prime, faster-growing issuer, which we are. I guess, the final set [ph] point I would make is that if you look at our total yield, it's strong. And so I think that -- that is maybe the best indication that we're balancing it all and achieving both growth and profitability.","R. Mark Graf","And Betsy, the thing that I would...","David W. Nelms","Do you have another question?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, I'm just going to say when it comes off teasers, how has the performance on the credit side been?","R. Mark Graf","It's been very strong. What I was going to say, Betsy, is that I think David covered the first half of the equation, which is really the NPVs and the come ons and everything else. But the second piece of the puzzle is to start watching these vintages very early and things you bring on promotionally, and you look to see if you're getting the behaviors out of those accounts that you like to see. For example, if you see an account that comes on and balance transfer, in the first 6 weeks, they never pull out their new card, we probably know that wasn't successful, and we need to start really trying to engage that customer pretty meaningfully. The flip side of the equation, if that card gets pulled out of the wallet 16x in the first 6 weeks, we're feeling a lot better about it, right? So you have to watch not only the cost of acquisition and what the ultimate profitability of those current balances are, but you also have to watch that customer, the behavior of that customer going forward. And I would tell you, we're very happy with the results from our promos and their activity as well.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Because you've been pretty active in trying to engage those customers quickly, can you give us a sense as to, has that customer utilization, so to speak, that pulling out of the wallet, been pretty steady state over the past year or so? Or has that ramped up? And roughly what percentage of your teaser customers are you able to translate into active card users?","David W. Nelms","Well, I can't give you numbers, but I can tell you directionally, Discover it, we're seeing higher retail engagement, a bit lower balance transfer activity than we had before. So we're -- than history had, so I think that the trends have been favorable.","Operator","And our next question comes from Donald Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, I think you had mentioned that the Paypal ramp-up was sort of a staged process. And you may have commented on this already, but can you talk a little bit about how many merchants have agreed to accept that, and how that staged process could work? And then secondly, I know some of the banks have complained that these merchant record models just sort of add risk to the payments system. I was wondering if you could sort of provide your perspective on that as well?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that I'm not prepared to give specific numbers. We're adding acquirers and therefore, the merchants that those acquirers go to continuously here. We're in a very active stage. I'm very pleased with the number. We've press released a good number, and we're going to -- we're expecting to continue to add additional acquirers to the equation. I think that what we have committed to do is to work as hard as we can to turn on our merchant acquirers and our entire merchant base to Paypal. But that doesn't happen with a flip of the switch. We've done this a couple of times before. I mean, Paypal has got some unique characteristics, but we've turned on the JCV and China UnionPay and BCcard and -- we've been working. There's no one in the industry that's turned on more new networks and merchant base and acquire base than Discover has, and I think that's one reason Paypal chose us. So we're going to be ramping up quickly. But I purposely used the word \"staged\" because it doesn't all happen in 1 day. And I think for us, the volume will build gradually and I wouldn't really think about a big volume benefit this year. In terms of your other part of the question, I'm simply not aware of any real issues. I mean, if you look at Paypal itself having 100 million customers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world, I'm not aware of issues that you talk about in terms of merchant of record.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, your sense on April credit card spend trends. I mean, are they holding fairly steady?","David W. Nelms","Yes, I'd say April is holding steady with the second half of the quarter. January was the strongest month on a year-over-year growth rate of the quarter, and then it just seemed like things slowed down a bit. I mean, continuing to see growth, year-over-year growth, but just not as robust as January, and it seems like that has continued so far into April.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I was hoping you guys could give some commentary around the trajectory of capital actions for the rest of the year, particularly for the second quarter. Last year, you had a big spike in buybacks in Q2 from almost nothing in the first. And I'm wondering if it's reasonable to expect a spike in Q2 this year relative to the other quarters at least?","R. Mark Graf","Bill, I guess, I'd lean into my earlier comment and say we're not really prepared to provide a lot of guidance on that front today. But the one thing I would say in response to your question -- your specific question, is that last year's 2nd quarter included a catch-up from our having been out on the market in the first quarter last year. So I would say spiking was more related to that. In terms of the year ahead, I just point you again to my earlier comment that it's a 2-year, $2.4 billion repurchase authorization and I wouldn't expect us to approach that $2.4 billion in the next 12 months.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And as far as the commentary that you guys have made on expenses, I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that a little bit. So you've made it clear that there's some opportunistic investments that you're making this year and that expenses will be elevated, and I think everyone was expecting that. They still came a bit lower than expectations. I'm wondering if over the course of the rest of the year, is there any reason to expect there would be some lumpiness in kind of that expense ratio from where it is this quarter? Or how should we be thinking about the progression of that expense relative to this quarter over the next -- over the rest of this year? And that's it.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think -- absolutely. Yes, I think you raised a very good point. It will be a little bit lumpy, Bill, is the most likely outcome. I think $3.1 billion on the full year is the right way to think about it. When David spoke earlier about our marketing expenses, he alluded to the fact that we pulled back on some planned direct mail for the quarter and few other things because the response rates we were seeing on the other channels for 'it' were so strong. So basically what we did is we've taken some dollars that we still fully intend to spend, and we pulled them out of the first quarter shock and awe campaign and we're spreading it out a little bit more to be maybe not a first quarter shock and awe, but an early part of the year mini-shock and awe, would be the right way to think about some of that. With respect to other initiatives, I would say there aren't any that are going to be particularly lumpy through the year, other than that marketing line item.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wonder, could you tell us in the Payment Services P&L, is there much in the way of Paypal integration expense? Is that pretty much done this quarter? Or...","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would say with respect to Paypal, we definitely, as David mentioned earlier, are responsible for the acquisition side of that equation. And so we are actively engaged in that and there are dollars being spent in that effort. So what I would say is, yes, in the Payments line item, there are dollars being spent on Paypal at this point in time. But I would say it's not just Paypal. There are a number of different initiatives that we have talked about. I think -- and a number that we have not spoken about, if you will, that are underway in the payments space right now that are driving some of that. So I would say it's a more broad-based approach to building out that business that's driving that expense line than it is Paypal driving that expense line.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then could you just talk about the lumpiness in rewards cost? How much lumpiness?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would -- I'd say for the full year, we still expect the rewards rate to be about 1%. There is definitely going to be some lumpiness in that trajectory based on the timing of our 5% Cashback programs and the way we are going to run these programs over the year ahead. So what I would say is, quarter-on-quarter, there's going to be some variability. I think, for the full year, though, what you should be looking for is the 1% rate is the target we're after.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Then should we -- which quarter should we expect it to be substantially above 1%, do you think, at this point?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would think about higher amounts in the second half of the year. So just as you saw us being -- I wouldn't necessarily expect it to be quite the magnitude of this past fourth quarter, but we tend to be heavier during the season -- the seasonal part of the year, and so I think higher in the second half than the first half.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","If -- sorry, I have one more follow-up, above the limit, but could you just tell us the -- how much of a distortion there was in the year-over-year growth from leap year, David? Is it about 1 percentage point? Was it 2 percentage points, do you think, in terms of your reported?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think -- we'll let you get away with it this time. I would think about it as 1 day out of 90 days as roughly the impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a little more on the spending volumes. Can you talk at all about your merchant acceptance initiatives? Is that still -- I know you're spending a lot of time and effort in improving the sort of virtual or the real merchant acceptance and making sure all merchants are aware that they do accept Discover. Is that still additive to your spending growth at this point? And also if you could address PULSE, I know you have some initiatives just to re-energize the volumes there. Should those start to kick in and help out the PULSE business in 2013?","David W. Nelms","I think I missed the second question, but on the first question, I would think about, I think it's still -- well, increased acceptance is still clearly additive and a tailwind to us. And that's true both in the U.S. as we get the remaining merchants on board as well less the online -- the international acceptance, that has ramped up significantly in the past few years. That being said, the remaining merchants in the U.S. are mostly quite small. And so I think that I would expect it to, at this point, start to be really a diminishing tailwind because we, frankly, have gotten the -- we prioritize the larger merchants, and there's just not too many of them left. Could you repeat your second question, please?","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just on PULSE. I remember from Diane's presentation at the Investor Day, she alluded to some new initiatives, some routing on signature potentially that would help the PULSE volume, help Discover regain some of the market share after Visa's changes that have seemed to have hurt that business starting this quarter.","David W. Nelms","Sure, well, I'm not prepared to talk in detail; it would be a longer conversation. But certainly, one of the things Diane pointed out is that we traditionally were a PIN debit network, and PIN was about 1\/3 of the market order of magnitude. And you saw us announce, in the previous quarter, Cadence Bank, which was a signature issuer, so we're clearly starting to add some signature issuers. We're also -- have taken close notice to what some of our competitors are doing and we're putting in appropriate responses to really try to provide options across our network for the full range of debit types, including as you mentioned, signature, not just PIN. And we're actively working with acquirers, banks, making technological changes to pursue everything that we possibly can to get back into the share gain that we have had for many years.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'd like to squeeze in one more, if I could. Just on the Home Loans business, it seems to have accelerated pretty meaningfully this quarter. Is that business already profitable, and do you expect the high volumes and the profitability to continue even under the potential of the refis to start to slowdown? I imagine it's mostly refi at this point.","David W. Nelms","No, problem. We've said before that it is profitable, but it's not -- it's a pretty small part of our profitability. And like other loan origination businesses, we're certainly benefiting from the current significant refinance volumes. And we do expect those to slow over time. So we saw a slight slowing in this quarter, maybe not as much as some others have so far, but we're taking a lot of steps to get stronger in the initial purchase part of the market to enhance our cost structure and ability to remain profitable through other parts of the lending cycle.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Mark, I wanted to ask also about some of these Payment Services investments; Slide 7 in your presentation. A housekeeping question: As we see return on those investments, should we be watching -- will it show up in Payment Services revenue? Or is it in that Network Partner line item that you have in that separate disclosure?","R. Mark Graf","Jamie, you're going to see it in both of those line items, is the way to think about it. We're investing pretty heavily in initiatives that run through both of those items. So what I would say is, without really talking about what they are, and given that a number of them are in the works and not yet public, I can't really do that; I can't kind of give you the break downs for how to look forward. But I tell you what, as this starts to roll forward and as we talk about new initiatives that we make known, how about if we just go ahead and let you know where those are going to be reflected going forward?","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","That would be helpful. We'd appreciate the disclosure. And then, David, maybe if you could just talk in more human terms about the partnership with Paypal. What do they like to work with as human beings, as technologists, as payment professionals? Observations in that direction would be helpful.","David W. Nelms","Sure. Well, just one follow-on to your earlier question. One thing that helps us is that in the network business, a lot of it is fixed cost and fixed infrastructure that we are leveraging. And so that's one of the reasons that getting additional volume on it over time is helpful and why you're not seeing much more massive investments despite some of these big opportunities that we have. Paypal has been great to work with. One of the things about them is that they are -- they're a payments company, and we deal with a lot of partners. But they are -- they're a strong technology company and they've been in payments for quite some period of time. And I think our teams have really enjoyed working with them. I think one of the things that has been great is the fact that they have really recognized that we are experts at point-of-sale and we're experts at offline network, having built it over the last 27 years. And we recognize that they are very nimble, and they have some attributes that together, I think, is helping us to really do some great things for consumers and merchants. And so I think they're one of our most important and great partners to work with.","Operator","And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned a few things about marketing, saying you pulled back a little on mail because the other stuff was still good. Could you talk about the efficiency of your marketing and this program and what you see going forward kind of compared to what it's been in the past? Because I think what stands out to me is that everyone else is kind of sort of making excuses as to why they're not seeing the growth. And maybe could you just talk about what it is about marketing programs that you find successful and how they've compared to others?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that we are seeing better efficiencies both on the direct-mail side and the non-direct mail side, all the others on this. And I think it starts with having just a great product. And we believe that Discover it is second to none in terms of consumer value, proposition, the rewards, the service, the fees, the services that it provides. And you see that in some of our marketing, where we're doing much more than we have in the past, direct comparative charts, they kind of point out the fact that we think it's the best in the market. And we're seeing customers respond to that and prospects respond to that. So I am very happy that I'm not in a position of having to make excuses. I'm in the position of working really hard to deliver results.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And just if you could follow-up -- any kind of metrics that you can share with us as to what the typical customer kind of looks like when they come on in the terms of either credit line or balance or spending volume, just if you could kind of frame that for us?","David W. Nelms","Well, kind of as I told Betsy, I'm not prepared to give any specifics. But I would just repeat that directionally, whether it's credit or usage or spend, we're seeing better performance with Discover it than we did with the previous More card. And I'm not so sure that it's as much getting a different customer base than it is getting more usage from these new prime customers. So we're really excited about it.","R. Mark Graf","And, Moshe, I would just kind of add to that, I guess the growth is not coming from issuing bigger credit lines. Just to be abundantly clear, we continue to be real conservative in our credit granting activities and we tend to start customers out with a smaller line than most of our competitors would, to be honest.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, I just wanted to clarify the comments around the margin. Given the strong margin this quarter and the expectation for declining margin in the second, but then rising margin in the second half of the year, is it reasonable to expect, Mark, for us to see a margin at the end of 2013 that's higher than where it ended 2012?","R. Mark Graf","I'm not prepared to call that yet, Mark, but I would say it's a possibility. I think the trajectory of your credit from here and the interest charge-off impact on that will have some degree of bearing there. Funding costs are rolling on a little bit better than we expected the funding costs were going to be rolling on at, quite honestly. So let's just say, it is a possibility.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on your personal loan segment, can you talk about how credit there, delinquencies and charge-offs were kind of tracking relative to your expectation? And what impact, if any, the growth in that segment is impacting growth in your cards business?","R. Mark Graf","I'm sorry, that was the personal loan segment, specifically, Mark?","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Yes, exactly.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would say growth there right now is tracking in line with our expectations. I think it's a business that's managing prudently for profitability with moderate growth as opposed to managing with a key emphasis on growth as the key to success in that business over the long haul. And that's indeed what we're doing. I would say, with respect to credit costs and performance, I would say it's a little bit better than last year, and also, probably a tad bit better than our target as well.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then any kind of cannibalization effects from that on your card business?","David W. Nelms","No. I mean -- I mean, you can't say there's not any, because certainly some of the people who consolidate their debt may have some Discover debt. But what I'd say is that there's not a change because we've been at this for now a number of years. And that we've been growing it for a number of years, so I'd say it's pretty steady state and the vast majority of the balances do come from external balances that consumers are consolidating to us, getting generally a lower APR, fixed repayment term, paying their debt down over time to deleverage. And that's what the product is designed to do, and it's working well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the Home Loans side of the equation. I know that you've talked about expanding in the home equity. So I was just wondering if you could update us there and then also maybe comment on if you're seeing other mortgage opportunities, perhaps maybe more of an opportunity on the jumbos side with some -- still what seems to be some dislocation in that market.","David W. Nelms","Yes, well, I would say it's still our intent to expand in the home equity later this year. However, we are still -- there were a lot of new rules that have just come out that were focused on home loans, but had some bearing on home equity as well. So we're continuing to go through there, look at the risk reward. And there's been no change in plans, but we haven't actually launched anything yet, so we are continuing to evaluate. In terms of jumbos, that's also something we could certainly consider long term, but I'd certainly would not expect anything on that this year. I'd say our big focus in Home Loans is on the business that we've got, the conforming Fannie, Freddie, FHA, how do we best serve customers and grow that business, maintain or improve profitability. And that's our biggest single focus.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A question on marketing, I was wondering if you could give maybe a little bit of a better feel for the spread of the budget there. How much of it is allocated to Discover it versus, say, the mortgage business versus and is -- are most of your originations on the card business now coming on the Discover it product?","R. Mark Graf","Bob, I would say, yes, most of the originations are now indeed coming on the Discover it product. And I would say the lion's share of the marketing dollars that are going out the door are going specifically to support the Discover it product. So I think the answer to both those questions is, yes. There are some dollars being spent around some of the other products as well. But I would tell you, they're not the drivers of the Marketing Expense line item, and they're not going to be the drivers of getting to that $3.1 billion total OpEx for the full year.","David W. Nelms","And the one thing I would add is that, that's -- what Mark said is absolutely true on the acquisition side. There's also a substantially substantial part of the marketing dollars that are targeted to our current customers as we offer Cashback bonus programs, we have activation, balance transfer programs. So that would go across primarily our credit card base.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Student Lending business, are you -- do you remain confident in being able to replace the volume that you lost from the Citibank relationship?","David W. Nelms","Well, we -- this was the first quarter that we were marketing entirely with our own brand, and I think you saw some pretty good originations doing that. So I would say, I'd let the results speak for themselves. We feel good about having maintained our volume with the Discover brand only.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then Mark, just a clarification, you had said -- I was not sure you had -- it sounds like had said earlier that your -- the credit outlook had improved, and I'm not sure what you meant -- this was in your opening, part of your opening remarks, if it had improved from the Investor Day or from year end or what you were...","R. Mark Graf","I would say the answer to that question is both ends. I would say it has improved since fourth quarter earnings and it has continued to improve post Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions, one on marketing and one on credit. First, on the marketing side, I think that there has been a perception -- and I'm sure you guys receive these questions about the pick up in intensity of marketing efforts that didn't necessarily, as we now see, translate into expense. I'm curious if the -- with the Discover it program and\/or product and the slight shift in that product, is there a greater geographic focus on the Northeast corridor? And is that driving some of this perception?","David W. Nelms","No, I think if you talk to folks in San Francisco or Miami or Atlanta, they're going to also say they've seen a lot more of us. It has not been focused on any particular part of the country; it's been very much a national launch. I think what's different is that we've been using much more -- number one, we have a great message to tell. So I think whatever ads you do get noticed a little more when you're seeing something new and different. And when we've got specific news on billboards, just talking about late fee forgiveness or other things, they get noticed more. But secondly, I think that lends itself to more of the nontraditional media, some of the top line media like TV. And our marketing's been moving towards the Internet for years, and so Discover it works well there. But I would, in no way, think that we've blitzed New England or something on that; it was very spread.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. It's funny because we have noticed a lot more radio and a lot less TV. In terms of the credit, one of the -- in response to Brian's question, I think this is very interesting -- you basically suggested that the frequency of default is decreasing. And so if you look at any individual consumer, basically what that suggests is that the probability of default, regardless of the severity of default, is falling. Given that there is an optimal loss rate within the portfolio, and it seems like you're below that, is there any shift in terms of risk profile? Are you comfortable taking a little bit more risk if you think that systemically the frequency of default is lower?","R. Mark Graf","Well, it's a good question, and certainly, we have seen significantly lower delinquency rates and default rates. And as you say, the frequency of both of those has come down a lot. I would say that we have continued to try to refine our models to identify other people that would have prime-type behavior and would have low frequency of default. And so to the extent that we can identify such enhancements in our models, we will put them in place. One of the things that Mark said in his in his -- in the text is that we have seen probably more of an improvement off of the base. And this may be partly because of the maturity of the base, the fact that we've held onto the customers and the fact that the people that at the margin were riskier, may have already been written off during the difficult times a few years back. And what we're left with is people that have extremely low default probabilities. That doesn't fully translate into new accounts because I don't think we've seen quite the same reduction in that for new accounts. And therefore, I think we have remained fairly cautious on trying to expand. We're going to be careful not to expand too much for new customers based on the behaviors that we've set -- that we've seen with customers that had been with us for 5, 10, 15 years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","The first question revolves around Student Loans. The CFPB has put out for comment, I guess, some comments or request for comment on servicing, and I understand they've been out talking to all the major student lenders. Just wondering if you have any initial thoughts on whether it will have an impact on servicing and whether it may drive expenses for servicing a little bit higher. Then I have a follow-up.","David W. Nelms","I really don't have a comment on that. Certainly, Student Loans is one of the important areas that the CFPB is looking at, and we would be fully cooperative. And I haven't seen anything that would guide me one way or another on what it will mean down the road.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow up on the transaction volume. I think you pointed out in the fourth quarter you had higher rewards level versus the first quarter. Just wondering if maybe that drove part -- if you think that drove part of the slowdown in spending growth over the course of the quarter, or whether you think it was more macro driven?","David W. Nelms","Well, our large fourth quarter promotions actually ran through December. And I guess, the fact that our sales continued to be very strong in January after we were into the first quarter promotions would suggest to me that the change is more macro than it was with our programs.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sameer Gokhale with Janie Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked. I guess, a couple of them, number one, I just wanted to get a sense for how actively or aggressively you might be marketing the Discover it card to your existing customer base. I know you said there were more positive responses and dynamics associated with that product, maybe, relative to your other products. So it seems like Discover has been a leader in terms of brand loyalty. I mean, I've had my Discover Card since 1995. And one of the issues used to be you have the long tenure, but you need to stimulate spending. Clearly, you focused attention on that. But it seems like marketing the Discover it Card aggressively to your existing customer base may make sense, so I just want to get a sense for that. And then I just had a separate question.","David W. Nelms","Well, first, thank you for being a loyal customer since 1995. And I would say that our primary focus has been on originating new -- new to Discover customers. We certainly make it easy for anyone who wants to switch to do so. But frankly, our More customers, like you, have been really happy. I mean we've just won the Brand Keys Award for customer loyalty for the 17th year in a row for our industry. And so our current customers are quite happy generally. And I think we see our bigger opportunity to attract some of the other consumers who may not have experienced the service and rewards that Discover offers to the product -- to the company and that's where focusing our marketing efforts on Discover it.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","But David, I mean, just along those lines, I mean there's difference of having the card for a long time and using it for spending. So over time, have you seen a significant improvement in stimulating spend for those folks? Like can you give us some striation for people who have been with you for 15 years, 10 years, what the incremental lift in spending has been over time? Because I think that was one of the areas you might have been focused on. So if there's any data you can share with us to show if there's been an improvement in actual usage among those longer-tenured customers?","David W. Nelms","Well, absolutely we've had improvement in usage activation, balances from long-time customers, from lots of different activation efforts, as well as from their experience with us. As an example, customers, when you came on in 2000 -- a number of years back, at that time, we didn't have the broad acceptance we have now. So you probably increased your usage just because of acceptance. Our rewards; we've added the 5% program and many other things. We've chosen to keep all of our customer service in-house, onshore, unlike other competitors. So we've had lots of activation efforts. Over time, if we see a way to stimulate more usage from current customers by cross-selling 'it' or what have you, we will do that. But right now, 'it' is really focused primarily on new customers. And the current customers would probably be a potential incremental opportunity down the road, but we're pretty busy with new customers right now on that part. We've got a lot of other efforts for our current customers.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it. And just the other question that I had was on student loans also. I know that recently, you basically said that on new student loans, you are not going to be charging any late fees or returned check fees. And clearly, that appears to be consumer-friendly, but was that something done in the prompting of the CFPB? And when you think about it competitively, I mean, there are only you and a couple of other guys are really players of any given size in the Student Loan business, so why reduce some of your fee generation opportunities when your competitors will likely match that and then you'll just end up reducing profitability? Why not just leave the model as is? So if you can talk about that, that will be helpful.","David W. Nelms","Sure. Well, that was purely our decision. There was no external prompting whatsoever. But we obviously did it because we felt that it would be good for our business going forward. That -- I don't know whether competitors will match that or not, but we certainly think it makes our product even more attractive to students and parents. And with pretty low delinquency rates, anyway, with the way we underwrite, it wasn't that -- it's just not that big of a -- it wasn't a big revenue producer anyway. So we felt like it was a good business decision for us to do it, so we're excited about it going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just one quick question on the rewards spending, which was -- or the rewards as a percentage of sales. Since it was elevated in the fourth quarter, you commented at the time that, that was something that you -- that was positive in the sense that it drove higher customer engagement. And then as commented earlier on this call, as our sales drop off a bit, like David said, it was strong in January. I'm just wondering how we think about this going forward as a way -- do you feel like it's being gamed by customers at times, or does it -- is the engagement really sticky there for these 5% quarterly programs as they rotate through sectors?","David W. Nelms","Well, what I would say -- I'd never think about things as gaming, I think about things as customers taking advantage of great things we have to offer. And we are constantly evaluating how much usage, how many enrollments, what it does to behavior within the category we're stimulating, what it does to behavior after the category, what it does both during the time of promotion and after the time of promotion. And so I would just say, generally, we've been incredibly happy with the 5% program that we pioneered and have offered and enhanced over the years. And we're going to continue -- I mean, it is a promotional programs so we change it every quarter and every year, and every -- and we're constantly evaluating how to make it more effective and even better and easier for customers. And it's -- a lot of it is not about the rate. It's also how easy is it to redeem, how can you redeem with various partners. What categories is it in -- during what type of the year. We've got customer service people that actually work with our customers to help them maximize the benefit. And so, it's kind of an all-encompassing program that we'll continue to refine and enhance.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So if I thought, and I could be wrong here, but the reward program was maybe too rich in the fourth quarter, you've got a number of dials besides -- a number of dials you can turn to adjust this, if that's your perception, too.","David W. Nelms","I mean, one of the unique things in the fourth quarter, we usually do a program by category, and we had 2 huge categories. I mean, we had stuff you buy in the Internet and stuff you buy in department stores for 5% during the holiday season. And so that was probably, by far, the richest program we had offered. I think more normally, we would offer 1 category, not 2 at a time. But we were in a big push in the fourth quarter and we've got even more take-up than we originally expected from it.","R. Mark Graf","And Chris, I would say, look, from -- to the very hard and specific point of your question, yes, there is a group of customers who do, who will tend to game this process. All the spend, if you will, in the card in that quarter is in the 5% category of that quarter; it's a very small percentage of the overall base.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. What's your gut telling you is the root cause of the moderating spend we've been seeing over the past couple of months?","David W. Nelms","Well, my assessment is that it is kind of in line with what I'm seeing retailers generally report. So I think our spend is kind of market environment. And then -- so if you go from that, okay, is it taxes, sequester? I mean, I don't have any additional data to say it's -- what exactly is causing consumers to spend a little less. It's not huge moderation, but it definitely seemed to be a little bit lower, as I said before, later in the quarter versus earlier. And you've seen a bit of consumer confidence drop off and certainly there have been a number of negatives from a consumer perspective. But how much is the news about Cyprus impacting how consumers feel versus the taxes is a little hard to parse out. Even lower gas prices is a good thing for consumers, but actually causes a bit of a downtick in spending.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question relates specifically to the balance transfer part of your business. You clearly have had a lot of success in terms of growing balances using this particular product, and you provided some good context for how you're filtering on credit. I think I'm really adjusted in what your success is in actually retaining those balances as you roll off the teasers? If you can talk about retention and attrition and specifically, what your strategies are to improve that as you go through, please?","David W. Nelms","Well, I'm not going to be able to give you specifics. And frankly, there's lots of segments, there's new customers, current customers, there's different durations, different rates. And we're looking at every cell to understand whether it's adding value or not and then we're making adjustments. And so we feel good about the efforts. But one thing to recognize, Ken, is that while the majority of the 18% is balance transfers, as you think about them, there's a nontrivial part that's actually retail promotional rates, and we do add those 2 together; when we give you the 18%, it's really total promotions of BT plus retail promotions. But there's a significant financial discipline around planning the administration and the analysis. And frankly, it also is changing over time. We see consumer behavior change a bit depending on what's going on in the environment, the interest rate, the competitive environment. So even if I could give you something for a given cell at the current time, we may find in 6 months that we're seeing a bit different behavior.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And are you able to react to how these consumers behave? So when you see certain behavior, whether that be good or otherwise, that you can effectively kind of create a campaign that effectively uses that behavior to your benefit? Or is it something that you can observe it, and I guess, make some general changes over time, but you just have to see how things manifest themselves over time?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think there's not a lot one can do for something that's already out there. But I think when we observe behavior and measure it, it feeds directly into all of our new offers. So every month and every week, we are determining who to offer what to, and so it affects the incoming volumes and terms based on the learnings of the people that went before them. And we do an awful lot of testing, too. We'll do testing control and some of the things we try work, and some of the things we try don't work. And it's -- the reason we offer promotional rates is to get people to try our product and then use our product on an ongoing basis. And if we're getting trial, but no usage, that's not what we want to do. We want long-term loyal customers.","Craig A. Streem","All right, thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.

My name is Robert, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Franklin, Investor Relations. Mr. Franklin, you may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Robert. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us on this afternoon's call. Let me start on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is on our website and we will be referencing during the call.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2012 and in our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2013, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the third quarter 2013 earnings materials, which are posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms","Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. After the market closed, we reported third quarter net income of $593 million or $1.20 per diluted share, with a return on equity of 23%.","EPS was down versus last year as the prior period included a large reserve release. Excluding the impact of reserve actions and onetime items, core earnings per diluted share increased by 12% over the prior year, driven by loan growth and share repurchases.","During the quarter, we returned approximately $450 million of capital to common shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends.","Card receivables grew 4% over the prior year, which, along with the combined 11% increase in private student and personal loans, drove total loan growth of 5%. These results show that in a tepid economic environment, Discover continues to achieve profitable loan growth.","Card sales volume for the quarter was up 3% over the prior year, but on a day adjusted basis, sales were up over 4%, in line with card loan growth.","Increased wallet share and new accounts continue to drive card loan growth at the upper end of our targeted range despite tougher comps. Discover it is generating good response rates and resulting in a more purchase active card member with less reliance of balance transfers at acquisition.","We expanded our product suite by launching Discover Home Equity Loans in August. While it will be some time before this product contributes to the bottom line, launching the product at this point in the housing recovery makes sense.","We were also pleased with the origination volumes in student and personal loans. Private student loan origination volume is on track to overcome the absence of the CitiAssist brand, which made up nearly half of the originations in 2012. Through card, student loans, personal loans, home loans and online deposits, Discover is offering consumers a broad spectrum of financing and savings alternatives to meet their needs.","In payments, year-over-year total dollar volume growth slowed as PULSE volume decreased by 2%. Diners volume also decreased 7%, mainly due to the impact of currency exchange rates. The debit environment remains dynamic, especially with Judge Leon's ruling, which will likely slow down the rate of new deals signed in the industry.","This, combined with the economic environment in Europe and potential pressure on Discover Network partners' volume, as we mentioned last quarter, continues to keep our near-term outlook for Payment Services muted. However, we remain optimistic about the segment's long-term potential.","Overall, our results for the quarter were positive as we once again exceeded the industry average card loan growth, organically grew revenue, and charge-offs continued to improve, producing an outstanding return on equity.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will walk through the details of our third quarter results.","R. Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As I've done in the past, I'll start my prepared remarks by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation.","Net interest income increased to $122 million or 9% over the prior year, driven by loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Net discount and interchange revenue increased by $23 million year-over-year or 9% due to Discover card sales volume growth, as well as a lower rewards rate.","The rewards rate was slightly lower compared to the prior year but increased sequentially from 86 to 98 basis points, driven by the timing of promotional cash back programs. As we've said in the past, you should expect to see quarterly fluctuations in the rewards rate as we look to further engage our customers and drive profitable sales.","Protection product revenue declined by $14 million over the prior year due to the discontinuation of new product sales in late 2012. Other income decreased by $58 million due to lower direct mortgage-related income and the inclusion of a $26 million gain on sale of a minority investment in the third quarter of last year.","As expected, Discover Home Loan originations slowed down during the third quarter as rates increased and refi volumes decreased significantly across the industry. After the quarter end, we eliminated some positions to better align our cost base with lower mortgage volumes. As we've said before, home loans are a key direct banking product for Discover, but due to the relatively small size of the business, they have been and they will remain relatively immaterial to our overall earnings profile.","Payment Services revenue decreased 11% year-over-year, mainly due to lower transaction processing revenue for PULSE.","Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.29% declined 10 basis points over the prior year, mainly due to card yield compression. This year-over-year compression was split between an increase in promotional rate balances and a decline in higher rate balances. Lower funding costs and, to a smaller degree, lower interest charge-offs, more than offset this yield compression, resulting in a 25-basis-point increase in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.64%.","Operating expenses, as shown on Slide 7, were down $58 million or 7% over the prior year. The increase in employee compensation was primarily related to a higher headcount to support growth, as well as new product initiatives.","Despite maintaining higher advertising in support of the it card, marketing expense remained flat with the prior year. Other expenses were down $76 million as the third quarter of 2012 included a $96 million addition to legal reserves.","Operating expenses for the Payment Services segment increased by $10 million over the prior year, mainly due to increased operating costs associated with Diners. This increase in cost is primarily related to the second quarter Diners acquisition, which will continue to have a modest ongoing operational drag for some period of time.","Overall, I remain pleased with our expense control as we managed our expenses in line with our target efficiency ratio of approximately 38%.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses increased $197 million from the prior year, driven by an increase in loan loss reserves. Our reserve build during the quarter mainly reflects 2 things: first, lower expected recoveries on well-aged charge-offs; and second, loan growth. Since we didn't sell any of our charged-off accounts during the recession, we experienced strong recoveries on a large inventory of charged-off accounts as the economy improved. But as we get further away from the recession, the benefit of these elevated recoveries is diminishing. You can see the slow decline in the recovery rate in our Trust filings over the last year.","So the key takeaways with respect to the reserve build in the quarter are that, first, we're growing our receivables base well; and second, we aren't refilling the charge-off bucket at a rate sufficient to maintain recoveries at the levels we have seen over the last several years. To be abundantly clear, our credit outlook for cards remains relatively stable.","Sequentially, the credit card net charge-off rate decreased 29 basis points to a record low 2.05%, and the 30-plus day delinquency rate of 1.67% remains fairly close to the record low established last quarter.","The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, increased 59 basis points from the prior year due to a larger portion of the portfolio entering repayments and decreased sequentially by 25 basis points due to seasonality.","Student loan delinquencies, excluding acquired loans, increased 22 basis points sequentially to 1.6%. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was down 23 basis points sequentially, and the over 30-day delinquency rate was 0.65%. The sequential decrease in the personal loan charge-off rate was primarily driven by growth.","Moving to Slide 9. We returned $450 million of capital to shareholders, grew total loans by 5% and ended the quarter with a strong Tier 1 common ratio of 14.7%. Our outlook for the rest of 2013 remains relatively unchanged.","Looking forward, we expect the credit environment will remain benign, net interest margin will remain elevated and we will continue to remain disciplined with our expenses and our investments for growth.","That concludes our formal remarks. So I'll turn the call back to Bill.","Bill Franklin","Thanks, Mark. As a reminder, everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. Robert, we'll take the first call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk about charge-offs. I think it sounds like you guys expect gross charge-offs flattish for the foreseeable future but recovery rates to decline, causing some mild pressure on net charge-offs. Is that right? And then on the recovery rates, could you just talk about what a steady-state recovery rate looks like and how long it would probably take to get there? Because I look back and it looks like the recovery rates used to be around 90 basis points versus 120 basis points year-to-date.","R. Mark Graf","Yes. Sanjay, if I don't catch all that, use your follow-up to bring me back to it. I would say with respect to charge-offs, I would take you back to our earlier commentary, we believe the credit environment is going to remain relatively benign. The key issue that caused the reserve build, with respect to charge-offs this quarter, again, was very clearly what we perceived to be something good, and that is that our current book is not having enough migration into the charge-off buckets to replace the level of recoveries that we've been enjoying from the large block of unsold accounts post the recession. So realistically, I would say benign credit environment with no turn in sight, as we see it right now. Absent some exogenous variables is kind of what I'd be thinking about. In terms of normalized recovery rates, I would say the number you use in normalized terms is probably a pretty decent number. I think the bigger challenge is we obviously aren't in a normal time at this point in time. So it's kind of hard to say exactly where it's going to be. None of us in our working lives have ever come through nor been in an environment like we're in today. So -- but that's as good a number as any to use on a normalized basis, I would guess.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I actually wanted to follow up on the charge-off question. I'm just kind of wondering about the broader need to take up your reserve rates this quarter when, granted, delinquencies were up Q-over-Q, but they're actually up less than seasonality would normally dictate, suggesting you still may not even have found a trough yet for charge-offs. Could you talk a little bit more about that, Mark?","R. Mark Graf","Sure. Yes. We -- just to remind everyone, we set our reserves on a 12-month forward-looking basis. So I know one of the key metrics you guys all have to look at is that reserve coverage ratio, that's really more of a rearward looking metric. Just to remind everybody, we don't focus on that at all. It's not a factor in our reserve setting decisions or discussions. And as we look at what's going on, I would, again, echo the comments that we see a very benign credit environment. We don't see any situation where there is any type of a meaningful deterioration in credit in the near-term horizon at all. I would say the reserve increase itself is driven again by those 2 primary factors I noted before, specifically, just we're not refilling the recovery buckets. So the net charge-offs will increase, if you will, as opposed to the gross charge-offs because you'll lose the benefit of some of those recoveries. But I don't think that's a fundamental turning credit by any stretch of the imagination, it's losing the benefit of those accounts we didn't sell at the peak of the recession. And then I would say secondarily, the other thing driving it is asset growth. We have been the only folks driving significant asset growth in the card industry now for a period of years. And ultimately, the cumulative effect of that is you have to provide for that growth as those loans season. Again, I think that's a good thing.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then I've got a follow-up on inorganic asset growth. Sallie Mae in their earnings call last week commented that they were looking at a private student loan portfolio. Without commenting on any specific opportunities, although feel free to if you'd like, is that something that would interest you, potentially adding private student loans that are out there to your portfolio?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I can't comment specifically. I guess, Mark, what I would say is that we're always on the lookout for good opportunities for our investors. And if we saw some of those type things, we would clearly look seriously at them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Speaking of good opportunities for investors, I was curious, your network for quite a while, looking at the different assets, it's -- Discover seems to be lagging the major peers we look at in terms of volume growth. Diners is certainly lagging. PULSE is hurting. With it only contributing $28 million to the bottom line, I mean, what's the thought process regarding not monetizing that network through a sale and converting over to a major network like Visa or MasterCard, where you double your acceptance and likely increase your sales? So I'm just -- I'm struggling with this. Is it the opportunity that something like PayPal brings? Or what are we looking at? Because continually, it seems like the -- in the near term or even in the medium term, perspectives are kind of bleak for the network.","David W. Nelms","Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, Craig. I'd say for a period of probably 5 years plus, we were gaining share, if you looked at what happened -- what PULSE's track record was in debit and the purchase of Diners Club. But our profits have been growing quite significantly, and it's really been only the last 2 quarters that you've seen us really take a hit on growing PULSE. And we've talked about some of those issues before. So I wouldn't want to take any decisions based on the business in a very short time period. But you did mention PayPal. But there's a number of other deals that we've signed with Ariba. We're doing some interesting things with Facebook and Amazon. So we're doing other networks around the world. So we've been planting a lot of seeds for the future. And as we have built out acceptance and extending our product line and partner set, we are very optimistic in the long-term potential for this business. So I guess that's -- that -- the short-term pressures on PULSE don't change that at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stifel.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My question is on the Diners Club network. And could you just give us any more detail on what's going on in Europe and of the Diners Club franchise as a whole? Volume seems to be going the wrong way, and the revenue impact seems even worse. Is there any more you can tell us there? And how long do you expect this drag to continue? And then just a follow-up on the charge-offs and the reserve build. I just want to ask, is there a change in your forecast that happened with respect to recoveries on these older loans or is it just a pool? It seems like when you build reserves, you're taking a forward-looking metric. So I'm wondering, is there a change in the behavior of some of these older loans or just the fact the portfolio of loans has shrunken us?","David W. Nelms","On Diners, there's a couple of factors. The first is, the most important factor for us when we purchased Diners was it allowed us to become a global network with global acceptance and to have -- to facilitate signing additional deals, net to net, to allow our card members to use their card globally versus just in North America, as had been the case in the past. And we're very pleased with how dramatically our acceptance has widened around the world. In terms of Diners itself, it's relatively immaterial to the overall company, but it's taken a number of hits. Obviously, we mentioned exchange rates moved against us during the quarter, which was a factor. We have a number of franchises that are struggling. I think that's particularly the case in Europe, where there's a lot of institutions struggling with liquidity issues and so on. But also, Citi has continued to divest some of their franchises that they historically issued on, and that's been a headwind. But -- and meanwhile, we've signed the largest issuers in China, India and Russia in the last year, and those kinds of deals take a while to kick in. So we're facing some headwinds, and we've got some what should become tailwinds over time not yet kicking in. So we continue to manage that very well for both the short term, minimize any losses, but for the long term, to get some of the benefits of truly having a global differentiated network that's fairly unique in the world. In terms of the pool of recoveries, let me try it a little bit different way. I mean, to some degree, we've been growing far faster than the industry. And so we've been having to essentially set aside loan loss reserves for growth over time. That's continued. We've also seen, over time, a gradual reduction in recoveries, and that's continued this quarter. What -- those 2 factors had been covered a year ago by the dramatic improvement in delinquencies and the charge-offs overall. So they've been swamping those first 2 factors. And remember, it's really an improvement in charge-off outlook and delinquencies that causes a reserve release. So even if you just flatline and stop improving or slow improving, you don't have a large release that covers the 2 factors that we called out this quarter. So I would think about the lack of improvement. And when you get down to 2% charge-off, in a credit card business, it's hard to -- you're just not going to improve forever.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question relates to the -- what has been a very impressive net interest margin for the last several quarters. And I guess I'm trying to reconcile a couple of different statements that you made, David, specifically around Discover it and the pickup that, that should have in terms of having growth without the use of teasers, yet the promotional rates are still moving higher. Can you just kind of reconcile in terms of what's driving the yields here within the credit card portfolio, specifically, and how you see those offsetting aspects of promotional balances and Discover it playing out over the next several quarters, please?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, Ken, it's Mark. What I would say is with respect to NIM, specifically, as it relates to those promotional balances, I would say the Discover it card member is coming on with a much lower level of promotional balances. What's keeping the overall level of promotional balances higher is portfolio BTs and portfolio promotional activity as opposed to the new card member acquisition on the it card side. So the it card member continues to be significantly more engaged and continues to come on at very low CPA with much more active behavior and requiring much less promotional stimulation, I would say, than we've seen in the past. So as I look at NIM more broadly going forward, I would tell you, as we look to the fourth quarter, I see room where NIM could be up slightly from the level we're printing in the third quarter. Beyond that, I think I'll reserve judgment until our Investor Day where we'll give some broader commentary beyond the fourth quarter. The one thing I would be remiss if I didn't do, is to remind everybody that the model is built over the long haul to deliver an 8.5% to 9% margin. We're clearly operating well north of that today, see an ability to continue doing that for some period of time.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just as a follow-up in terms of the cost of funds. That's obviously been a big release valve for NIM as a general point. Can you maybe discuss what your incremental funding options are and what those costs are so we can begin to factor that into our calculus, please?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I would say the fundamental channels we're leaning into are obviously going to be the consumer deposit channel directly. That one is always a winner for us because it comes with a customer attached to the other side and build synergy between the right and the left-hand side of our balance sheet. And it also, again, comes with a customer you can cross-sell to. The other big channels we're using obviously are the ABS channel, as well as the banknote channel. To a lesser degree, we use the broker deposit channel as well, really more around the edges at this point in time. We've been shrinking in that book over time. In terms of the potential impact and everything else, I would point you back to the schedule from our Investor Day presentation that's out there on our website. It's got the upcoming maturities, as well as the rates associated with those maturities. And I would assume no major gigantic shifts in mix over the near term. And you can just use your market rates to plug into your models there.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ho from Deutsche Bank.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to touch base on the non-card growth and personal loans and maybe touch base on some of the early indications you're seeing on the home equity installment loan side, what the dynamic will be with home prices increasing and personal income levels rising. How do you view that kind of mix playing out maybe in the medium term?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think in terms of personal loans, we've seen good opportunities to have quite strong growth. It continues -- we continue to see consumers deleveraging and wanting to pay down debt, consolidate loans and pay down debt over time. And so that product has continued to be a very big winner for us. I'm also pleased with the growth of student loans. It's been more modest growth in part because we needed to replace the Citi brand. But the fact that we've gotten the kind of originations we have, while replacing that brand that a year ago represented half of the originations, I feel very good about. Home equity, it's really way too early. I think we'll probably have a lot more to talk about at Investor Day with that because we're just out for the last 2 months. I think we feel very good about the timing because home equity, the consumers have in their homes, is now starting to grow, both from pay-downs and real estate pricing recovery. I think that consumers are going to, in a rising rate environment, are more likely, if they need home equity, to take out the home equity loan versus refinancing their whole first mortgage, given that they may have already locked in a lower rate for their first mortgage. And it fits very well. So we've got -- I feel very good about the launch so far, the pipeline and where we stand. And maybe we'll have some more metrics for you by the time Investor Day comes along.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just 1 follow-up. I just want to talk about the competition you're seeing in card. You mentioned before that you're seeing a lot of competition in the rewards space. Have you seen any acceleration in terms and condition or pricing over the last couple -- couple of months?","David W. Nelms","No. We've had very strong competition in cash rewards for several years now and I think we do see, in any given quarter or year, one competitor will tend to get stronger while another one is backing off and vice versa. But I think -- if I think about -- as I think about, overall, the level of competition, it's high, it's been sustained and I expect it to continue to be sustained at this kind of level. And that's one of the reasons we're so excited to launch Discover it, is to be the best competitor out there and that we've certainly been pleased with our results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura Securities.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","You haven't added receivables to your trust in some time, so it's hard for us to see how loss curves look for some of your more recent vintages, but I was hoping you could maybe share with us what peak loss rates you're seeing, I'd say the 2011 vintage, which should be nearing peak levels now, just so we can kind of get a sense of how the trajectory of your charge-off rates is shaping out.","R. Mark Graf","Yes. Bill, I would say, we haven't provided color on that in the past. We'll take that under advisement as we look forward to our Investor Day coming up in the spring time. What I would say is they are performing in line with our expectations. We're not seeing any development -- any loss development that is deteriorated from the expectation we had at the time we originated those credits.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And can you say '12 -- whether '12 is directionally trending better than '11? I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense to -- just directionally.","R. Mark Graf","I think what I would say, to kind of get back to the question, again, we haven't provided color on that, so I want to be careful on how and when we do that. But I would say is that harkening back to our expectations for the credit environment, it remains very benign. The new vintages are performing absolutely in line or better than our expectations and the reserve actions this quarter don't have anything to do with any adverse development under any of those vintage curves.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, that's fair enough. Lastly, can you talk about the 5% cash back bonus program that you currently have in place for online shopping, how that's going? And perhaps also talk about the change relative to last year, which also included retail? Just trying to get a sense for what kind of impact the exclusion of retail could have and how we should be thinking about that.","David W. Nelms","Well, I think we're pleased and, so far, meeting expectations. I think that it is more typical for us to have one category versus multiple categories. So I'd say, probably a year ago was more the aberration, and so we're comfortable that we can continue to stimulate our base with Internet. Also, I would just say that Internet has grown a lot even this year versus a year ago, in terms of how much consumers are using it. So that's probably a more important opportunity for consumers given the growth in the Internet space.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. One is just on spending growth. You came in at 3.2% year-on-year in third quarter. And that is a little bit different from some of the peers, your spending growth came down from second quarter, which was 4.4%. So I'm just trying to understand what might have driven a deceleration in the growth rate and spending?","David W. Nelms","Yes. Well, I'd say, Betsy, the -- if you day-adjust it, it was about 4%, which was pretty on top of our loan growth and that's been true for us over the last several quarters, that our loan growth and our sales growth have been similar. And haven't seen any particular trend. And yes -- I mean, obviously, with the government shutdown and so on, we have been looking for, is there anything going on with consumers? And I really haven't seen anything. When I look across competitors, I'm seeing some up and some down from their run rate. But as a general prospect, we're seeing the same thing. Competitors are not growing their loans, but they're growing sales and they appear to be, to a much larger degree than we are, going after different transactors.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then on the -- okay. And the follow-up is just on the expense side on marketing, you're down obviously 6% Q-on-Q. I would -- is it fair to expect that you'll be ramping that up into the fourth quarter and looking to drive up the spending growth rates?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. Betsy, I think that's a -- probably, that's a pretty fair assumption. We definitely tend to take them up in the second half of the year and into the fourth quarter, tends to be a big time on the marketing side. What I would say is we've put out some revised guidance around total expenses last quarter at $3.2 million. I would say I still feel good about that. I don't see any reason that we won't be able to accommodate that level.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So if you're taking up marketing expenses in 1 place, you might be lowering it elsewhere, is that your point?","R. Mark Graf","For non-marketing expenses elsewhere, yes, correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk, Mark, about whether the reserve rate -- the percentage of loans is likely to be increasing. I understand that the things you talked about, I guess, as we go forward, is that likely to be a higher percentage of loans as we go into the fourth quarter in 2014?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I would say, at this point in time, don't see it being a meaningfully higher percentage of loans as we head on in. Again, I would drive you back to the earlier comments that everything we're seeing in the portfolio right now is consistent with a benign credit environment and the factors affecting the reserve this quarter are really those more exogenous factors, related to the fact that we're growing the receivables base well and we're getting seasoning under those curves and, as well as the fact that we aren't generating enough new charge-offs to refill the bucket to be available for use in recoveries.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And as a follow-up, David, I'm sure that if you wanted to kind of spur additional volume from people that are transactors, you could do it. Could you just talk about the thought process, I mean, what are the benefits or the risks of actually trying to do that?","David W. Nelms","Well, what I'd say is that we follow a very disciplined process to not just chase volume growth but to deliver profitable customer relationships and that means that the best opportunity seems to be people that at least have some propensity to occasionally revolve, because the primary revenue producer in the industry, and for us, continues to be the net interest margin, whereas the interchange, by the time we cover rewards and expenses, is a much smaller piece. We also are keeping very disciplined, because I think transactors look particularly good to some people today because we're in such a low cost of funds environment and, obviously, in a different environment, the cost to float is something that changes those dynamics a lot. And so we will continue to evaluate it and make sure there aren't some additional incremental opportunities to go after people that are more transactor-based or have higher sales. But if you look at our track record on growth on loans and return on loans, we're best in class on both of those 2 factors and that's good because those are the 2 things we most try to optimize.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sameer Gokhale from Janney Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess just one of the things I just want to flesh out, and you did talk about it at length. But just one thing I want to clarify in terms of that recovery rate, I mean, should we think of it as this quarter, there was kind of a onetime true up to your recovery -- expected recovery rate and in going forward, all else equal, it's going to be more -- provisioning is going to be more a function of your loan growth? Is that the way to think about it, that there was kind of a onetime issue element from a recovery standpoint this quarter as you trued up the reserve for a lower recovery, am I thinking of that correctly?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I think what I would say, Sameer, is the situation, obviously, continues to evolve. I prefer not to go into conversation of quarter-over-quarter changes in reserving estimates, specifically at this point in time. I think we don't know what we'll know as the quarter moves forward and we'll set our reserves based on the best information we have at the -- near the end of the quarter, as opposed to trying and to guesstimate what that's going to be right now. What I would say is that recovery rate expectation, we have brought -- we've brought down meaningfully, quite honestly, from the level at which it's been operating. And we continue to see good growth in the portfolio. The best guidance I can give you, I think, is to take you back to the earlier comment, that is that the credit environment remains benign, that we would expect the underlying performance in the portfolio to reflect that.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just another question was, in your other expenses, I know last quarter, you had some expenses related to Diners. But this quarter, also, I mean, if you look at last quarter's numbers, strip out the Diners charges, you have maybe kind of close to $100 million-ish run rate in the other expenses, this quarter I think about $118 million, is there anything else flowing in, maybe as residual expenses from the Diners charges or something else this quarter?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, Sameer, we've got some Diners charges like with the elevated payment services expenses that we called out flowing through there, and a little bit more on the global acceptance side and I think then there's just some cats and dogs, but that makes up the delta.","David W. Nelms","Remember, we essentially purchased the Italian franchise, for instance, last quarter, taking the onetime charge, called out at that time that we would be then operating it. So you've got the normal operating costs that were expected and an ongoing operating loss because we now own those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Valentin from FBR Capital Markets.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just with regards to your protection and product revenue. It was up slightly, quarter-over-quarter, and it's been trimming down for several quarters in a row. Has it kind of reached the bottom and this should be kind of a base and then it grows from here?","David W. Nelms","No. I'd say we are continuing not to sell that product and so you would expect then attrition into gradually reduce that line until such time as we should start to sell those products again. There will be fluctuations from one quarter to the next but I'd think the longer-term trend for now would be a gradual decline.","R. Mark Graf","It has been slower than our expectations to your point. The attrition is definitely been slower than we expected.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on personal loans. The yield's up about 16 basis points from a year ago, it's up almost 16, I guess -- sorry, 6 basis points linked-quarter. Just with the growth you had, I guess you're getting -- the competition level in that product, I would suspect that with a lot of growth you'd see, maybe loan yields come down on a linked-quarter basis, but that's not been the case?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I would say that, that product continues to perform particularly well for us. We're very ,very happy with the yields we're seeing there. I would say without any significant credit expansion, we're able to command some very good pricing in that marketplace. Right now, we feel very good about it.","David W. Nelms","Yes. And we\u2019re also seeing some payoffs as the older vintages mature, which were at slightly lower rates and newer vintages have come on over the years at probably higher rates.","Operator","Our next question is from David Hochstim from Nomura Securities.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I don't think I changed...","David W. Nelms","David's from Buckingham, right?","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes. I'm still at Buckingham. But I wonder, could you talk a little bit about what we saw over the course of the quarter in terms of spending behavior and lending? You said that loans attract spending but loan balances declined in the month of September, I think, and they grew nicely in July and August and for the quarter overall, but is there something -- did you see some changes in behavior during the quarter end and how about in October, so far?","David W. Nelms","I would say that I've seen a fair amount of stability both in sales and loan growth. Obviously, how a weekend falls or what promotions we have going on one year versus another, can certainly have an impact on 1 month. As I look at the day adjustments and everything, I haven't seen any particular trend in either direction for either sales or loans.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And so do we think that the decline in loan balances in the amount of September is kind of unusual and it's not reflective of some new trend with October be...","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that you're better off looking at the full quarter to take out that noise and I feel good that we're continuing to be towards the top end of our 2% to 5% targeted range in credit card loan growth. And I think it's -- I believe that, once again, it was the best in the industry.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So September is not consistent with that as a month, but look at the quarter and think about Q4, obviously Q4 seasonally should be pretty good?","David W. Nelms","Yes. I mean, by looking year-over-year, we sort of take out the seasonality. And -- but I would say, we feel good about last quarter and we're continuing to work hard to stay towards the top end of that range.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the credit questions. Mark, I take your point that the credit is likely to remain benign, but is the normalization in the recovery rate outside the Master Trust happening at a faster pace? So is the actual recovery significantly lower in that part of the portfolio?","R. Mark Graf","No. I would say that the Master Trust is a pretty decent representation. In that sense, Ryan, I would say a couple of different things. Remember, we're not -- we're rearward looking on recovery rates. When we're setting our reserves, we're looking at what we expect those recovery rates to be over the ensuing 12-months period of time. So we're looking at trending in that recovery rate and what we expect that trying to be, going forward. The other thing I'd really be cautious onto is if you're thinking about that last month in the trust, you'll note there's a footnote there noting that, had we not done the account removal that we did, that recovery rate fell pretty significantly, I think it was more like 107 bps as oppose to the 116 bps that got published by virtue of the math. So recovery rates continue to decline. I thing the trust is a reasonable -- not a perfect, but a reasonable proxy for what we're seeing there.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just one quick follow-up, on the reward cost, it seems like it came out a bit better than we would've expected again. Given these quarters online shopping, are you still targeting 1% reward cost for all of 2013?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think somewhere in that neck of the woods is a pretty good estimate. I think we'll probably come in a little below 1% on the full year, would be my current observation place.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, David, I was curious what your appetite for acquisitions is currently? And in what areas, if you have an appetite, where you might focus?","David W. Nelms","Well as Mark said, we would always be open to great opportunities. If you look at our track record, we've been selective. We've made acquisitions where they fit most strategically and financially. We fit -- they obviously have to fit the Direct Banking or payments partner strategy. But I'd say, we focus most of our attention on organic growth than growing the businesses that we've currently have and have built, and we would be cautious. But we would certainly look at opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","David, I was hoping you can give, maybe, some thoughts on your partnerships, PayPal, Ariba, Facebook, Amazon, maybe, I mean you haven't -- didn't give any update on PayPal. Well just maybe some thoughts around the strategy and working with those companies in particular, Amazon payments, Facebook payments, the Ariba business-to-business. I'd love some thoughts on those partnerships and over what time period you expect them to start generating some real numbers for you?","David W. Nelms","Well, I'm pleased with the progress that we're making. They -- as we've said in the past, there's 2 things that are good. One is we are a building portfolio of partnerships, so we're not counting on any 1 and not all of them will work, but we think we've got enough of our portfolio -- building enough of our portfolio, that some of them will work and, hopefully, some of them will work really well. I think that these -- we're talking about some very new areas. We are coming at them from a very differentiated approach. For instance, no one, I think, has ever come at the Ariba opportunity the way we are. And so these things will take time to get ready to launch. Then once they launch, we expect the volume to come first and the profits will be a ways out. So I think that one way to think about it is that it's like having a whole number of options and those are the long-term options that we think some of them will pay off really large, but I wouldn't think about them really as being that meaningful even through next year, at least in terms of the profit side of the equation.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","What is, maybe just as a follow-up, I mean, what is unique about what you're doing with these partners and maybe using a Ariba as an example?","David W. Nelms","Well, it opens up -- Ariba is business-to-business, so it opens up a whole new category that's not -- if you think about the size of the credit card industry, it's all spend that's not even there. It's not part of the industry as we know it today. And so it's a way to leverage our existing network, infrastructure, acceptance capabilities in a totally new marketplace. But with -- because it's leveraging our existing infrastructure, it's a relatively low cost and is a better value and better service than companies paying other companies achieve today through other means. And so what's, I think -- each one of these new opportunities are differentiated. They're not copying anyone else. They don't exist today. Some of them are really hard, I mean, we have to -- PayPal as an example, turning on a new network for 8 million merchants is not easy and I don't think it could be done without our help, but the payoff, we believe, will be very large over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Buried within the CFPB's report that they put out earlier this month on the CARD act, they mentioned that some issues and practices related to rewards and marketing promotions have become an area of concern. I'm just curious if this is something that's come up in your conversations with regulators and how do you feel about where your positioned relative to peers on rewards and -- most specifically on rewards, not too much on marketing.","David W. Nelms","Well, I feel very good about our focus on consumers and disclosures. We are looking at everything that we do and -- as our regulators, and I would say that I'm pleased that most of the areas that came at -- that were addressed during that study are areas that we don't have involvement with, like deferred interest cards or fee harvester cards, we're not currently marketing fee products. But obviously, rewards was mentioned. I think that you need to think about the fact that rewards are so prevalent, they're now on most cards in the industry. And so it's not surprising that, that would be an area of focus. One of the reasons I feel good about us is that cash is more straightforward than points or some other complicated programs. They're easy to use and redeem. We've particularly put in features to make them even easier to redeem and add value when they're redeemed and it's a great value to consumers overall. We've got about $1 billion a year of cash rewards. That's a huge value to consumers.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Friedman from SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I think, Mark, on Slide 7, you called out employee compensation increases and you talked about higher headcount. I was just wondering where that headcount is going? And David, I'll just get the 2 in upfront. So with regard to network partners, how should we be thinking about -- or phrased a different way, how do you measure your success in network partner initiatives, so we can kind of harmonize with how you grade yourself?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I would say -- I'll start off in response and let David take up. If you're looking at the higher employee compensation expense, I would say the headcount is really, Jamie, in support of our growth initiatives that we have across the company. So that's going to be everything from the launch of the home equity product to the further build out of a number of other different initiatives, there's also obviously some heads involved in the emerging payments partnerships, the second part of your question as well. So between our growth initiatives, new product initiatives we have and then I would say there's obviously, just like with everybody these days, a little bit that's go into the regulatory climate and make sure that we are dotting Is and crossing Ts and doing everything that's expected of us as a responsible player in the industry. So those would be the key drivers there.","David W. Nelms","And then in terms of network partners, I would divide it into 3 areas. I think, first, I measure what are the deals that we're signing and what's our track record for signing deals with some really strong partners compared to others, and I feel particularly good about that. I think in the medium-term, which is not yet, I would measure volume. What kind of transactions and dollars are these deals as they get implemented, producing? And then in the long-term I measure profitability, that's ultimately what you're after and how much money do we make in these deals, but that's a long-term.","Operator","The last question will come from Daniel Furtado from Jefferies.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just was curious if there we're any changes in the way you report delinquencies? And if not, do you feel this quarter was the inflection point for the 30-day bucket?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I would say there's been no changes to the way we report delinquencies. From the standpoint of an inflection point, no, I don't think anybody around here is prepared to say, we think that's the inflection point. We're obviously at uncharted territory. We're not used to seeing car delinquencies in this level. And as I've said before, the models are built off a history and the predictive capability of those models is driven off of that historical set they have as well. So I think it's going to be even more difficult to call a turn in this environment than it would normally be and we'd be very cautious about doing that. I guess in response to really, I think, what's behind the question, I'd point you again back to my thoughts that the credit environment is definitely very benign right now. We could see improvement from here. We could see deterioration from here. But what I would say is that's going to be around a mean as opposed to some giant movements based on what we see right now.","Operator","And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is John and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note: this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Franklin, you may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you -- for joining us on this morning's call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report; in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011; and in our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended August 31 and May 31, 2012, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to start off by discussing the fourth quarter and then walk through some highlights of our full year accomplishments.","Before the market opened, we reported quarterly diluted earnings per share of $1.07, up 13% over the prior year, driven primarily by loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated return on equity of 23% and returned approximately $451 million of capital to common shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our robust results, strong capital position and positive outlook led us to announce a 40% increase in our dividend to common shareholders.","This quarter, we accelerated our organic growth to 6% on total receivables. Card receivables growth for the quarter was the highest in over 5 years, driven by spin from the revolver segment of our card base. Our strong receivables and sales growth results demonstrate the effectiveness of our marketing programs, consumers' preference for cash rewards and our acceptance and awareness initiatives.","For the fourth quarter, our noncard assets, specifically our personal and private student loans, achieved a combined 11% year-over-year growth as we broadened marketing and added new schools and a fixed-rate product in student loans earlier in the year. Our Payments segment experienced 13% year-over-year purchase volume growth, driven largely by PULSE. Volume processed on our networks achieved an all-time high for the fourth quarter.","We also increased our level of investment to drive future growth and achieved the full potential of our Direct Banking and payment strategy. Important new initiatives included new domestic and global payments partners; a new core banking system; our first checking product, which we expect to launch in early 2013; and Discover it, our new credit card product that is testing successfully in select markets and will be launched nationally next month.","Our card net charge-off rate set another record low, but our over-30-day delinquency rate ticked up slightly due to seasonality. While the continued improvement in credit appears to be nearing an end, we don't believe we were -- we are at a point where charge-offs are poised to rise significantly.","Now, I'd like to share some thoughts on how we performed against our 2012 priorities. We had 2 principal priorities for our Direct Banking segment. First, we wanted to build on the momentum from 2011 and grow card sales and receivables. Second, we wanted to grow our noncard product offerings. During the year, we successfully grew card sales and receivables in a challenging environment by increasing our marked wallet share and achieving double-digit new account growth. We increased customer engagement through our rewards programs, marketing initiatives and by expanding online and mobile capabilities. We increased merchant participation in our rewards program, which also enhanced the value for our card members. For the full year, card receivables grew by $3 billion or 6%.","In our Direct Banking segment, we grew noncard assets and launched new products, including home loans and student loans focused on graduate and professional programs. By leveraging our expertise in unsecured underwriting and maintaining the customer-centric focus, we disbursed over $1 billion in private student loans and grew personal loan originations to $1.8 billion. Additionally, we originated over $2 billion in home loans since June.","In payments, we continued to build on domestic and international acceptance and successfully grew our network volume while dealing with competitive challenges. For the full year, volume for the Payments segment grew by 12%, and we achieved a record number of active merchants. Further in Payments, we positioned ourselves as a flexible and innovative partner for payment solutions with a number of new agreements, domestically with PayPal and internationally with new network and issuer partnerships.","Lastly, one of our top corporate priorities was to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. During the fiscal year, we returned a little over $1.4 billion through share repurchases and common dividends.","Our fourth quarter provided a strong finish to a record year. As we enter 2013, I am looking forward to maintaining the momentum in our Direct Banking segment and executing on our recently formed network partnerships as we continue to leverage our network assets. We look forward to providing you with an update on our 2013 priorities at our annual financial community briefing in March. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","R. Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by reminding you that as of January 2013, Discover will be converting to a December fiscal year end. We'll provide you with historical calendar year data in early March in advance of our financial community briefing.","That said, I'll begin my remarks on this quarter's performance, starting with the Direct Banking segment, which earned $827 million pretax this quarter versus $776 million last year. Net interest income increased $134 million or 11% over the prior year, driven by both asset growth as well as the net interest margin, which was 34 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%. Lower funding costs and lower interest charge-offs more than offset a 17 basis point compression in total asset yield from the prior year. Specifically, card yield declined 20 basis points from the prior year to 12.16%, due to more promotional balances and a decline in higher rate and default priced balances. Interest expense, as a percentage of average receivables, was down 49 basis points over the prior year to 2.11%, due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect to continue to benefit from this funding cost tailwind through 2013.","Over the next year, the combination of yield and funding cost trends should keep net interest margin above our long-term target of 8.5% to 9%. However, we do anticipate some compression, driven largely by card yield, which should continue to decline.","Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $50 million higher than the prior year, mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans, our mortgage business that we launched in June of this year, as well as a $26 million gain on the sale of a minority investment. The mortgage business was profitable for the quarter. However, I would remind you of my comments from last quarter's call that we continue to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time.","Continuing with other income, our rewards expense, a contra revenue item, increased to 106 basis points on card sales during the quarter, due to what was, in retrospect, a richer than expected 5% cashback promotion that generated very strong cardmember engagement. We do not expect this elevated rewards rate to persist into the calendar first quarter. However, I would point out that the current program runs through December.","Another component of other income, Protection Product revenue, was down from last year, and we continue to expect this line item to decrease over time. During the quarter, we did cease marketing these products to focus on implementing changes required by our consent order. We continue to service and maintain existing products and memberships and intend to once again make these products available to new customers next year.","Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $114 million over the prior year or 18%. There are several factors contributing to this higher level of expenses. First, we increased employee headcount as well as marketing and other expenses due to the Home Loan acquisition and the launch of our direct mortgage product, which contributed roughly $50 million to expenses in this period.  Second, as evidenced by our strong receivables growth, we believe investments in marketing are bearing fruit in this environment. And as a result, we think the timing is right for us to continue to opportunistically drive new account acquisition and card utilization. Finally, our headcount information processing and professional fee line items grew further, as we laid the groundwork for launching several new products in the coming quarters and added resources to address new regulatory expectations. Some of these initiatives will also result in higher operating expenses next quarter.","Turning to credit. Sequentially, the credit card 30-plus delinquency rate increased 5 basis points due to seasonality, but the net charge-off rate declined 14 basis points to a new historic low. The over-30-day delinquency rate for student loans decreased 21 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, increased 22 basis points from the third quarter. The net charge-off rate reflects increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. We would remind you that as the portfolio seasons, we will see this rate rise past 1% and come back down over the long term. The credit performance of both our organic and purchased portfolios remains in line with our expectations.","The personal loan over-30-day delinquency rate was up 2 basis points, and the net charge-off rate was up 22 basis points sequentially as the portfolio continued to season. Over the course of the year, we have said that loan growth will eventually lead us to build reserves. This quarter's $38 million reserve build reflects the strong asset growth that we have realized.","One last thing I want to mention is that effective November 30, the company began including confirmed card transactions as parts of loans in process, which resulted in a $365 million increase to ending card receivables for the fourth quarter. This will have no impact on historic or future income statement items, including earnings per share, but will lower some ratios which use average card or total receivable balances in the denominator such as card yield and net interest margin.","Turning to the Payment Services segment, pretax profit decreased 21% over the prior year to $33 million. The decrease resulted primarily from higher expenses at Diners, which included marketing and incentives related to several new issuing relationships. Expense increases were partially offset by increases in higher margin point of sale volume for our PULSE debit network and higher Network Partners volume. Network Partners is our new name for what we formerly referred to as Third-Party Issuers. We've changed the name to better reflect our strategy of partnering to drive volume growth. However, the composition of the business has not changed. Segment volumes were up 13%, driven by strong increases in PULSE and Network Partners volumes.","Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on-balance sheet liquidity portfolio at quarter end was $9.6 billion. Total available liquidity was $27 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion over the prior quarter. We opportunistically executed a $575 million, 6.5% perpetual preferred stock issue and a $500 million debt exchange offer that allowed us to broaden our regulatory capital mix. Also in November, we issued $250 million of 3-year Class B asset-backed securities with a floating-rate coupon of one month LIBOR plus 45 basis points. This is Discover's first Class B issuance since 2007. As we have said before, we'll continue to opportunistically fund our business by accessing all available channels.  We ended the quarter with a 13.6% tier 1 common ratio, which was 30 basis points lower than the last quarter.","Let me conclude with some full year comments. We achieved record net income in fiscal 2012 due to improvements in credit, loan growth and a higher net interest margin. The payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint to achieve record network volume and entered into several key partnerships, which we expect to be drivers of future profitability. Lastly, we continue to deploy capital, as evidenced by today's announced dividend increase to $0.14, as well as our repurchase of over 6% of our shares over the course of the past year.","That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to the operator, John, to open things up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I'll ask my 2 questions upfront. Just the first on credit quality, I think David, you mentioned that you don't anticipate a significant rise in charge-offs. Could you just talk about the dynamics there, when we look a year out from now, especially when you -- when considering how you factored in to your provision? Do you assume flattish a year from now or up slightly? And then secondarily, just on operating expenses, I was just hoping to get some color from Mark, maybe. When we look out to 2013, is $3 billion roughly a good assumption to use as an annual budget for operating expenses? And then maybe on rewards costs as well, is 100 basis points still a good number, roughly?","David W. Nelms","Sanjay, on -- we're certainly in an environment that we've never experienced before on credit. So it is a difficult line to forecast. But it's my expectation that we're going to see, at this point, some flatness and more seasonal trends occurring. It wouldn't surprise me to see a slight increase over the coming 12 months. But as I've kind of indicated, we're certainly not expecting anything dramatic. And so if you look at the reserving, it's largely due to our loan growth, which I was very pleased to have achieved a 5-year high growth rate, and that leads to more reserving. And that's more of a driver as opposed to expecting a big increase in credit cost. Mark?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would -- I'd echo David's comment on that one. I mean, I think receivables growth is central to our business model. And as we've been saying, that growth would, at some point in time, cause us to begin to build reserves. And the growth in reserves you've seen is a direct result of the growth in loans over the course of the last several years. With respect to your expenses question, Sanjay, I would say a couple of different things. I think as we look forward to next year, that $3 billion number is a close number to utilize. It may come in a little bit higher than that, would be my general expectation, however. I think in terms of an operating leverage way of looking at things, if we were not investing in a number of these growth investments over the course of the next year, we would be reporting flat operating leverage for 2013. I think we will be slightly below that because of the investments in growth we're making. I think you all understand that when you're investing for organic growth, the expenses lead to revenues. But given the ROIs and the opportunities we see in these products, we're very comfortable going ahead and making those investments. With respect to the rewards rate itself, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think the 106 basis point level that you saw this quarter was higher than we expected it to be, quite honestly. That program was probably a little bit too rich, in retrospect. But it did drive fabulous cardmember engagement, which is great. I would say going forward, I would expect it to be closer to that 1% level is the right way to think about things. Though again, I would point out for the month of December, that higher program is still running.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Taiano from Telsey Advisory Group.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","So I guess on the volume side, I was just curious, and I guess first, if you saw any impact from Sandy for the full quarter. I know you had that impact the first week or 2, but just wondering if that was anything material. And then secondly, looking out to next year, I know there's a lot of uncertainty around the fiscal cliff. But I was just -- it seems like, at least one thing that seems consensus from both sides is the elimination of the payroll tax cut that's been in place the last couple of years. I'm just -- was wondering if you could give any thoughts as to how that might impact your volumes looking out to next year.","David W. Nelms","Sure. I would say that, in terms of Sandy, we don't think it had a significant overall effect on our volume during the quarter. It's certainly had a regional impact, obviously, with timing. We saw some sub-components that changed around a bit. For instance, home improvement had been softer before Sandy and post-Sandy. There's been enough rebuilding needs that we've actually seen that component drive higher. So there've been some ins and outs maybe from Sandy, but I think the overall volume, not too affected. I think in terms of fiscal cliff, we don't have a separate plan for -- as I've heard some companies have. And we think that -- I don't expect a big impact. I do expect something to get resolved. I think the big wild card is what happens to consumer confidence. And I think as long as consumer confidence doesn't take a big nosedive, I expect our sales volume and so on to continue doing just fine. If consumer confidence, for whatever reason, went down significantly, then that's what would probably start affecting sales volume.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great, and then just one follow-up. The CFPB, I guess, put out a notice yesterday saying they're going to kind of look at the impact of -- that the card hack has had over the last couple of years. I'm just curious to see if you had any thoughts as to whether that could be either positive or negative, just given it seems like there's been restriction in credit as a result of that. And I wonder if they may decide to make some changes. Just any thoughts you might have there.","David W. Nelms","I hadn't seen that, what -- it's a wait to see. I'd be surprised if there was a big impact as a result of a study like that, just from what you're saying. But I'll have to wait and see what\u2019s up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","David, on the rewards fund, and it seems like you guys are taking advantage of the spending growth and loan growth that you've been generating and just continuing to invest for growth and offering more attractive rewards. Can you share your outlook for investment spending for the new year, both for you and the industry? And specifically, do you expect some of your competitors to have a tougher time maintaining investment levels, given that many of them are still not seeing loan growth?","David W. Nelms","Well, certainly I think it's a very good opportunity for us to continue to invest in growth. We've been gaining share in loans over the last couple years, and that's accelerated this quarter. And so in Direct Banking, we're investing to continue to gain and accelerate loan growth in card, to broaden our other Direct Banking offerings in student loans, personal loans and other products. And then obviously, in the payments area, we're investing -- we're -- we've just got many more opportunities in front of us at this point. And we think it's time to really grab some of those and invest in that business, which will be great for the long term. I think, in terms of the competition, I think that's part of why investing is looking better for us. We have seen some competitors pulling back on, for instance, direct mail volumes and advertising. And I think we'd be foolish not to take advantage of that kind of opportunity.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then finally, my last question is on your partnership with PayPal. It shows that you know how you guys are using your network in a way that's disruptive to how the payments ecosystem has traditionally worked. Is it reasonable to expect that we'll see more deals like that? You mentioned there are some things kind of in the works. So without obviously commenting on anything specifically, but I just wondered whether a similar kind of partnership to what we saw with PayPal where you turn on acceptance for them and all of your merchant locations is something that we could expect with say, like an MCX or others who are were kind of entering the industry and trying to be disruptive themselves?","David W. Nelms","I'd say yes and no. I certainly -- I think PayPal is in a fairly unique position and I'm really excited about that opportunity. There is no one else in the market that's exactly positioned the way they are. So what I expect is not other PayPal-like deals, but other deals that are also disruptive in different ways. And we are talking to a number of partners who see our flexibility and unique assets as a big opportunity. And so I am certainly hopeful that over the -- as we get into next year, that we'll have additional partners to be talking to you about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Arnold from RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You've seeing strong loan growth in 2012 and particularly good performance here this quarter; clearly, a rarity in the financial sector, so keep up the good work. But just curious if you could give us an update on your loan growth outlook for the year ahead and perhaps also update us on the card side, in particular, with respect to how you're progressing on the card acceptance awareness, translating into more lending volumes.","David W. Nelms","Yes, I think that I'm really pleased with the 6% this quarter, significantly higher than the 2% to 4% that we had targeted and in our Investor Day discussions. And certainly, it's nice to see this kind of growth when the overall industry continues to decrease, so significant share gain. It's going to be tough to maintain it at quite the 6% level. So I'm not sure we'll be able to maintain that throughout the year. But I'm certainly hopeful to at least be at the high end of the range that we've targeted in cards. And I mentioned Discover it. I think a lot will ride on how successful that is. We've seen good results from the test markets, but it's -- we really have to push hard to have this kind of growth in a non-growing card overall market. I think the acceptance that you mentioned is part of what's allowing us to achieve this kind of growth, combined with the higher level of investment spending, cash rewards programs, new products, all the other things. It's hard to disentangle everything. But I'm certainly pleased with the growing acceptance, the awareness of acceptance, the deals we're doing with acquirers, and that is paying fruit for us, or resulting in some of this growth.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I mean, could you just expand on the Discover it, kind of compare\/contrast with your typical card offering as well?","David W. Nelms","Well, I won't go into a huge detail on this, because there's too many features to fully talk about. But I am very excited. It's a cash back, no-fee card with an extremely high level of service and unique features that are designed to save customers interest and fees, and also has a different look and feel in terms of the card itself, and in how we're delivering it to the customers. So we're -- we'll look forward to briefing you more at our Investor Day about it, and you're likely to see some stuff -- some marketing of it show up next month.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I've got a follow-up on credit. I don't know if there\u2019s a fair way to frame it, but how do you think about the level of reserves relative to charge-offs going forward?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I guess Mark -- this is Mark. I would say that from my perspective, I would echo David's earlier comment, in that the reserve build you see this quarter is largely due to the growth in loan outstandings. We don't see a fundamental inflection point in credit here, I guess is what I'd say, just to be clear about it. Going forward, I think, as we continue to grow our balance sheet, there will likely continue to be requirements for provisioning associated with some of that growth. You think about it, we've been generating strong growth for a while now. And I think David indicated we continue to expect to see good solid growth going forward, and so that will force us to continue to provide. The way we look at things is we use a forward-loss emergence period. Currently up to 12 months so that's kind of how we're looking at a forward window of what we see coming at it. And the growth that we have been generating over a period of time has reached a level, to the point where we're providing for it a little bit. But we do not see a fundamental inflection point in credit here.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And what loss rates are you assuming on the receivables you're adding?","R. Mark Graf","I don't think we've provided that information historically, as part of our underwriting models. But I would say we are not underwriting to current loss rates. I would say we are underwriting to what we believe to be more normalized loss rates.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I just had one question about the mortgage business. What should we be looking at, as far as when we're going to see that become a meaningful contributor to profitability? Is it an issue of market size or is it just more work you have to do to kind of integrate that and rightsize the expenses?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think it's a couple different things, Mark. I think, first, foremost and fundamentally, it's a new business for us. And consistent with the way we like to do things, we're going to test drive it a little bit before we jam on the accelerator. So I would say that's a piece of the puzzle. I would say another piece of the puzzle would be we said all along there is some optionality there. We wouldn't make any broader commitments to the business until we had further clarity around how some of the capital treatment and some of the GSEs, some of that was starting to evolve. I think we're starting to get some clarity there, but we're probably not all the way to the full clarity we would want to see, to really move things forward. That notwithstanding, I would say we don't enter things with an idea of playing at them. So my perspective is there's a great opportunity for us in the mortgage business. And as we get more comfortable with it ourselves, and make sure we understand the various levelers and all the risks, it probably will -- you should look for it to become a more significant contributor going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Valentin from FBR.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just quickly on the networks you've mentioned, you've signed a number of agreements with -- that are unique. And just wondering when will we expect to see some type of a bottom line impact on some of those agreements? It seems like some of them can be pretty sizable, like China UnionPay or the PayPal, or even, I guess, in the media, you've seen Google Wallet association.","David W. Nelms","What I would expect is that we've just signed a bunch of deals and next year is going to be a lot of implementation and costs related to that, and getting going. And so I would probably think more like in the 2014, and then certainly into the 2015 period, to see some, much more serious volume from those new agreements starting to hit and generate profits.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then just a follow-up on the expense line. I mean, you mentioned investing now to drive growth later on. That's on the marketing side. You also mentioned some employment expenses associated with the mortgage bank. In the context of the $3 billion give-or-take number that Mark, you kind of referenced before or was mentioned before, how much of that is due to that kind of employment line? How much of this due to the marketing side?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would say it's combination of both. At this point in time, marketing will be a big driver of the launch of a lot of these new products, some of which we've talked about and some of which we haven't. So that'll be a big piece of it. Headcount expenses have been part of the equation, but they have not been the lion's share.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, when you think about capital, I mean you bought back $1.2 billion of stock, grew loans 6% year-over-year, increased dividend, yet your capitals levels are up 40 basis points year-on-year. So can you talk about your outlook and priorities for capital returns into 2013? Could this be the year that we actually see a decent dent made in bringing down the capital levels?","R. Mark Graf","We would love to see that be the case. I'm happy to talk about capital. We are currently in the throes of our annual capital planning activities, both internally and with our own Board of Directors, and also preparing for submission in the first couple days of January to the Fed, as part of the CCAR capital process, our annual capital plan as well. I think you all know that any capital actions we propose to take need non-objection on the part of our regulatory body. I guess I'd say a couple of things. Number one, I don't think we feel that we were necessarily aggressive enough in our ask last year. So I think you should expect our ask to be somewhat more aggressive than it was last year; it was not objected to. I think the other thing I would say in this regard is we remain committed to being responsible stewards of that capital. And fulfilling that mission is going to be a combination of deploying it at ROE levels above our threshold 15% that we have talked to you about in the past, and finding ways to get that capital returned to our shareholders to the extent we don't have the ability to do that. So it's not lost on us that you guys would love to see an increase in the returns of capital, and we are working toward that end.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just as -- Mark, as a follow-up on the comments on the potential for negative operating leverage. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about that? Are you looking at it as including gross revenues? Are you thinking about rewards as a contra revenue or actually as an expense?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I'm including it as a contra revenue, but it's going into the calculation in the way I'm thinking about it, Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","David, I was really kind of struck by the 6% growth in receivables. You had mentioned that, that being driven by increased spending on, from revolving customers. And yet, the quarter doesn't really include the bulk of the holiday spending period. And by the same token, I didn't notice that your payment rates have had declined or anything. So could you talk about -- I mean, it feels like it should persist then. I mean is there something I'm missing?","David W. Nelms","No, well of course, we're comparing like time periods. So we're looking at the same time period, prior year in terms of the percentage of the holiday season. I would say that we saw, probably higher sales growth during year-over-year in November than we're seeing so far in December, and we saw this last year as well. And I think that one of the things that's happening is that more and more of the retailers are having bigger sales around Thanksgiving and accelerating some of the holiday spending into that month. So that is a likely kind of thing. And I guess the second thing is we did get -- we have been getting some extra pop from the higher rewards investments and other investments we've made. And while that will likely carry through this month, and if I look -- if I think about full year, we're going to be pulling back a bit to more normal levels of promotions. And that can also affect that growth throughout the year.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And just to follow-up, I mean is there anything you're seeing from the consumer side in terms of their willingness to actually carry some more debt? Because that would be obviously a positive. And can you talk about that, maybe -- and maybe what you're seeing into December?","David W. Nelms","I would say I haven't seen a big change this quarter. But for the last few quarters, I've been saying that we've seen sales and receivables growing at about the same pace, which suggest to me that a lot of the leveraging that has taken place over the last several years has run its course. And so I just -- I think this quarter, it was more of the same.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, more of a business-type question on your marketing. How much of your marketing is mailing today, versus let's say, some of the newer channels like online as a percentage today, let's say versus 3 or 4 or 5 years ago? Can you talk specifically about how that might have changed or not changed?","David W. Nelms","Well, it\u2019s certainly changed dramatically over the last several years. And Internet and online has become a very significant part of the marketing mix, and I think that'll only continue to grow. Direct mail is easier to track. And so sometimes when we look at level of marketing intensity, it's a little easier for us to compare statistics on mailings being up or down in relative mail share. But we see more and more of our business moving online because it's very cost effective. We already get the majority of our applications come in through online, as opposed to all other channels combined.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then, it sounds like you're pretty constructive on payments and opportunities for investment. You have a lot of capital. Would you make any type of sort of decent-sized acquisition in Payments? And would it be more likely domestic or international?","David W. Nelms","If we saw the right opportunity that gave us the right returns and fit with our strategy, I would love to be able to bulk up in Payments. Obviously, if you look over the longer time period, we bought Diners and PULSE, so we have made Payments-type of acquisitions. We've made some smaller investments in this space. But -- so I think it could be, for the right deals, it could be a great way to deploy some of this capital. But that being said, the prices of properties tend to be pretty high. These -- our assets are quite unique. And so I think that what we have been finding is that there are a lot more opportunities to partner with others, as opposed to buying others, and that's been true both domestically and internationally. And so I think that, that is a more likely scenario, is to see more partnerships as opposed to acquisitions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Shane from JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When we look at your card growth, it's starting to break even more from the pack. And I think we really want to understand what's going on there. When -- I know you don't provide account numbers. But when you look at the drivers of this, can you give us some sort of sense of a ratio between how much of it's being driven by existing customers increasing balances, and how much of it is being driven by net new accounts?","David W. Nelms","I would say that it's been pretty balanced growth. And we've both balanced between new accounts and more usage from existing accounts. We've got more from sales as well as more from balance transfers. And I would say we're getting impact from growing share within existing merchants as well as the new acceptance that we've been able to put in is also giving us. So each piece may be a percent or so, and you have to kind of add it up to get to the 6% loan growth that we're seeing in total. The one thing that I would say is that we are not sacrificing credit quality. And if you look at where the growth is coming from, it is coming from the medium to high FICO scores bands as opposed to from low FICO score bands. So the one thing that's consistent across all these channels is it's good prime credit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The acceleration in growth on your proprietary card this quarter, 3.5% last quarter, 6% spend growth this quarter, is that primarily driven by some of the new incentives, David? And you talked to -- you mentioned teaser rate product as it relates to the margin in the quarter. What are -- what is -- what are you doing in teaser rates today?","David W. Nelms","I would say there is some promotional aspects. We had a, as Mark mentioned, more aggressive promotions this year than we -- than last year. I'd say that was more to do with -- the difference between this year and last year during the quarter was much more the rewards program and the fact that we are offering up to 5% on both Internet and department stores than it was pricing, promotional pricing. So it -- I think it\u2019ll likely pull back a little bit as we get into next year, just as we go back to more normal promotional promotions.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then the investment that you made, the incremental investment in payments, and there was a big jump in the payment sector and your operating expenses, I think $12 million quarter-over-quarter. And -- I mean, is that primarily -- should we expect to see those expense numbers stay around that level? And is that primarily being driven by PayPal? Or what else that we -- what specifically are you doing in that sector that's driving up those expenses?","R. Mark Graf","Bob, I'd say there's a couple of things going on in the Payment space. Specific to the quarter, Diners expenses were responsible for about 2\/3 of the year-over-year increase. And they were primarily related to several new issuing relationships that we have talked to you guys about in the past, that we established in the last quarter or so. And you should think about them more as onetime oriented in nature. I would say that being said, as David noted, we're looking for a number of other opportunities in this space and actively engaged in those. So there's possibility, as you look forward of other onetime expenses creeping in as a result of that. So the way I would think about the payments business in 2013 is I would think about it as a year of investments in building to reap real returns down the road. Don't read that as a big backpedal, but also, I wouldn't expect the payments business to be the primary driver of growth in revenues and earnings over the course of '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stifel.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to hit on the growth questions a little bit more and the promotional activity. Can you talk at all about the interim month trends in spending? Did you, like once the promotion kicked in, I believe it was October, was there a several hundred basis point acceleration in your spending growth number? And then, as I guess, more broadly, do you think with the loan growth we're seeing this quarter, are we seeing any early signs of a pickup in consumer demand in terms of response rates to mail and the one's that to revolve? Is there any of that going on? Or do you think at this point, it's mostly just the promotional activity you've had, both teaser rate and also any net purchase causing the balance growth to also tick up?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think I've already discussed the inter-quarter volume, with November being the strongest year-over-year, month of the year, and then less so in December. But I think that's not so much related to our -- any promotions we're doing, but related to pull forward of retailers broadly, sales and to earlier in the holiday shopping season. And I think in terms of the promotion, and I mean, we've got a promotion that ran the fourth quarter of -- fourth calendar quarter. So and it runs through December, there's nothing sort of inter-quarter...","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Take it through the March to the -- in August and September, or sorry, so it's September relative to October, is it just like a couple of hundred basis points of spending coverage you got from that program? Or was it just minor impact?","David W. Nelms","I think at that point, minor.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess another question I have on that topic was, just in returns of response rates. And I have -- a follow-up question would be, on the fee income side, of the fee products, you saw, I think on a sequential deceleration in the fee products that the revenue's falling a little faster this quarter. Does that 7% or so decline, does that continue into 2013, as you wind those down? Are you mostly through the wind-down at this point?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, it's -- as you look at the fee products revenue line going forward, as I mentioned, we did see some marketing of the products during the quarter. We took a hiatus here to make sure we have everything in place to comply with our consent order. It's our intent we will begin reissuing or re-offering those products to our customers. But in terms of from a guidance standpoint, I would say, you had, what, a $5 million, roughly sequential decline in revenue related to those products. For now, I would say that's probably a good way to think about the continued impacts going forward.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Oh, 2013, $5 million a quarter?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think that's probably a good way to be thinking about 2013 on Protection products at this point.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just last, circling back, any pickup in demand, David, that you're seeing at the consumer level, in your fee service analysis?","David W. Nelms","I would say that we have seen some good results from our Discover it product, which is why we've made the decision to roll it out next month. And so we're looking forward to that launch.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess I'll ask both my questions upfront. There was a slight deceleration in PULSE volumes this quarter, still good numbers. Was wondering if that's the mix shift of debit and credit, or if there's something more profound related to the FANF or the competitive environment? That was my first one.  And then, Mark, you had mentioned that the offset that you had a $26 million gain on the sale of minority investment. I was wondering if you could share more details as to what that might been.","David W. Nelms","Yes, I think in terms of PULSE, I would expect a further deceleration in the next quarter. While I was pleased with the overall growth rate we experienced this quarter and the last few quarters on PULSE, that would have been even higher without some of the competitive challenges, I'll say. And one of those competitors is the Goliath in the industry. And as they continue to roll out some of these new kind of hijacked transaction actions, a lot of those were just being rolled out now, and will have an increasing effect on all the other competitors in the market, including PULSE.","R. Mark Graf","And then with respect to the $26 million gain, we don't disclose the specific names, but we do have a small portfolio of what I would call strategic minority investments that we make, as part of our Payments business, where we see opportunities either be able to acquire, or more ultimately partner with these folks, going forward. We'll sometimes take a stake in those opportunities. And when the strategic value either does not pan out the way we thought it would, or for other reasons we determine, it's just not the right direction for us to head, we typically look to monetize these investments. And I think this one falls into that latter category, and just shows that we do know what we're looking at in the Payment space, even though it didn't end up working out right for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sameer Gokhale from Janney Capital Markets.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I had a couple. I guess the first one is on your private student loan portfolio, you continue to show great credit numbers. But loans in forbearance, do you know how the statistics are, if you compare them year-over-year for the private student loan portfolio? And do you foresee making any changes to your forbearance policies as you look through the portfolio and credit quality in the economic environment? And then I have a follow-up.","David W. Nelms","Yes, Sameer, I think that our forbearance policies are pretty much dictated by what's allowable in terms of regulations, which have not changed year-over-year. And I think that the big effect for us is that we are going to be going through a seasoning where we've had a lot of growth, and we're getting -- we're going to have more of the students that we booked, who will be entering repayment for the first time. And most of the losses or about 1\/2 the losses that you occur -- that occur over the life of a student loan occur the first 2 years after repayment. So as we get more of those people, we're going to end up having more people in forbearance, more losses, and then you get a maturing over time. And it, I would say, that business continues to perform on a vintage basis as we had anticipated.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then, you've talked quite a bit about credit card loan growth and given some helpful commentary on that. But that's something, which I think is kind of an obvious question, but just be helpful to get additional perspective on that. When you look at the credit card business and the fact that there are, of course a few, small, a small number of large competitors in the business. And you are investing in rewards and trying to gain share, or you are gaining share of receivables, how do you think of it from a gain theory perspective? Because it strikes me that you invest on rewards. You get some share, then somebody else invests more in awards, and they take away some of the share from other folks. In terms of the natural growth rate, of -- underlying growth rate of the industry, doesn't it make sense to dial back on investments just because, if everyone starts doing that, everybody loses? I mean, how you think about that, at a high level?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think from a high level, I think of cards as being a slower growth business. And so if you think about it, that's a little bit more of a 0 sum game, our goal is to continue to gain share. So you've seen us gaining share in loans for now a few years. And what I see is that while it's a smaller number of sizable competitors today than in the past, the good news is, they're more rational competitors. So I think they're not going to be dropping credit standards to reach for growth, which is always the biggest concern you've got. And so what it comes to is us using our competitive advantages to gain share, so our advantage in service, our advantage in rewards, our advantage in growing acceptance, our advantage on differentiation, including with new products. And so we're going to be focused on -- from a game theory perspective, using all those competitive advantages, to gain share in the credit card market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two quick questions on the checking product. I thought that was something that you had intended to launch in fiscal '12. And I'm just wondering, first, if there's anything with the timing that's related to the conversion of your core banking system. And then secondly, if it does launch and does scale significantly, could it also be another tailwind to your cost of funds in '13?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that our core banking system's on track. I would have loved to have gotten the tracking -- the product out this year. And it looks like we're going to miss it by a couple of months, 5 -- 1 quarter. But I think what I would attribute more of that to is that it is a more -- it's probably a much more robust product and a better product than what I might have anticipated a year ago. And so we wanted to really kind of get it right from a consumer value proposition. And so I am really excited to the able to launch it early next year. In terms of the impact on cost to funds, that's, that is our reason for launching it. We don't expect this to necessarily make money as a product, except it's going to be, over time, a good low-cost, stable source of funds and an additional important core relationship. And I expect it to not have a material impact in the near term, because it's going to take some time. By definition, these are the sticky bank deposits. And so it's going to take some time for us to pry those sticky relationships into a direct banking relationships. But I'm excited about the technology and the value that we can offer to, over time, have that start to become a tailwind on cost of funds. But I think realistically, you're -- you'd have to look more in a -- 2014, 2015 and beyond that, just to really start seeing some movement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Furtado from Jefferies & Company.","Martin Kemnec - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This Martin Kemnec in for Dan Furtado. Quick question on the promotional balances. I assume that in the low rate environment, that it's still positive from an NPV perspective. But curious, when these eventually start to come off their promotional periods, is it reasonable to expect that we could see, maybe some stabilization in card yields as those balances start earning fees? I think, David, you may have just mentioned, possibly reeling in there a bit, or would that not be, kind of meaningful enough to really move the needle there? And then on credit, Mark, your comments are very helpful. I just -- one, a kind of modeling question on the reserve rate. Is it safe to assume that kind of 3%, call it 315 basis points, is the correct reserve rate to model going forward until we kind of start to see credit inflecting?","David W. Nelms","So Mark, we'll give you more update on the promo rates at Investor Day, as we've done the last few years. But you're right. We are able to maintain good NPVs with more promo balances and lower rates in today's cost of funds environment than we would in different environments. And we're taking advantage of that now to be able to offer our customers some very good deals cost effectively. I guess I would -- I tend to think about as a little bit of a wash, that more -- less of being an opportunity. But more, as the rate environment changes, then you have to look at your promotional rates and what percentage are at promo, where's the duration and all of that, as one way to help mitigate some of the less benign rate environment over time.","R. Mark Graf","And as far as the reserve coverage ratio is concerned, it's -- we don't really track the reserve coverage ratio. It's -- I mean, we do follow-up, we don't manage to it. It's a rearward-looking metric, and we look forward. I'd say there's a bunch of factors that can affect it. So not prepared to give specific guidance on what that rate should look like going forward. What I would do is echo our earlier comments though, that we don't see a fundamental turn in credit at this point. And any reserving that takes place will really be driven in our view at this point, based on the seasoning of that account growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wondered if you could share some additional thoughts about the dividends. I know you had a big increase this quarter, but it's been a year since the last one. And your payout ratio is still quite low, relative to other very large, well-capitalized banks. And I wondered, if -- well actually, if you could share your thoughts about payout ratio, and how soon you might look to make another change to the dividend, assuming the Fed signs off on what you'd like.","R. Mark Graf","Thank you for the qualifier at the end there. That's helpful. I guess from our perspective, it's pretty straightforward. We definitely see room to take our dividend payout ratio higher than it is right now. And I would also say that as we change our fiscal year, we may change our quarterly dividend payment dates to correspond a little bit to those of our peers. I would also say that we've been saying for a long time, we'll revisit our dividend no less frequently than annually. I would specifically reiterate that statement to you today.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Would you consider reevaluating it more often than annually?","R. Mark Graf","I don't think I'm prepared to give any further guidance than I did right now while we're in the preparation of the capital plan. Let's just say we see room to take that dividend payout ratio higher, and one should not assume we're going to stay on a December cadence. How about that?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think when you look at credit over the last few years, it's been a tremendous positive driver for Discover. And I think it's understandable why you don't expect it to get any better. And I also understand why you'd expect the provisions to go up as the balances grow. And that, obviously, was very encouraging in the quarter. But what I'm interested in knowing is what do you think that it will -- what will drive loss rates or delinquency rates and ultimately loss rates higher on a percentage basis? Is it just a macroenvironment? Is it the seasoning that Mark, you just touched on? Is it lower recoveries? What are you -- do you think is going to drive delinquencies and losses higher?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say a couple of factors. One is seasoning of the book. If you looked at the -- how much everyone pulled back during the financial crisis and very few new accounts were booked, we're now back into a more normal time period. And so as the new accounts that have -- are now being booked, start the season, that will tend to increase the loss rate a bit to more normal levels. I'd say a second thing is that as we get further away from the very large spike in charge-off rates, to some degree, people that were close to the edge all got recognized in a short period of time. So much like the bankruptcy law changed from a number of years ago, where there was a trough afterwards, and it took a few years, but eventually you get back to more normal levels. So I think as we get away from the spike, you're going to eventually start to normalize. And so those are 2 macro factors. Then you start getting back into the normal, unemployment, health care costs, divorces. These are the kinds of things that in prime business, tend to drive charge-offs, and you get back to more normal levels of all those, kind of life events.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And could you remind us, what this, the timeframe of seasoning typically would be within your portfolio?","David W. Nelms","Typically, one thinks about 2 years, maybe about 2.5 years as being a peak charge-off, and then coming down after that point.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","David W. Nelms","All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Hope you all have a happy holiday, and feel free to reach out to Investor Relations if you have any follow-up calls.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Bill Franklin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the second quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session.","During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $616 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.47, up 11% year-over-year. These results included a non-recurring tax benefit of $44 million, which contributed $0.11 to diluted earnings per share.","Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year with a healthy net interest margin. In the card business, we also grew receivables by 4%. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on their cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased. Card sales grew by 2% over the prior year, a bit lower than we would like.","Our sales growth was outpaced by the growth in rewards; however, we're seeing benefits from the double rewards campaign in new accounts, sales from new accounts, and in the cost to acquire these accounts. Along those lines, we set a post-recession record for new card accounts during the quarter, demonstrating that our brand, rewards and overall value proposition continue to resonate with our target customers. We believe these new accounts will contribute to future sales and loan growth and will leverage our brand and increase consideration. We launched credit score card, which provides both current and prospective customers with access to their FICO score, as well as the summary of the data that is helping and hurting their score.","Our other Direct Banking products also performed well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15%, driven by our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover Student Loans.","Personal loans grew 10% over the prior year, driven by digital investments and increased marketing, which have allowed us to drive growth while still maintaining an average FICO on new accounts of around 750. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016.","On the funding side of Direct Banking, I'm very pleased with the 16% growth in direct to consumer deposits. These deposits made up 47% of funding at quarter end. Our investments in marketing have continued to pay off, driving strong growth specifically in savings accounts and balances.","Moving to our Payments business, PULSE volume declined 9% year-over-year. We expect PULSE volumes will stabilize around the end of the year. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year, with Diners Club volume increasing 6%, driven by strong growth in the Asia Pacific region.","During the quarter, we received a lot of positive recognition from third parties. To highlight, Fortune ranked us on its list of 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials. And Computerworld ranked us as one of the top 100 Places to Work for IT Professionals. We believe our commitment to treating our employees well translates into delivering the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.","Overall, it was a good quarter. We're making progress against our key focus areas for the year and we're pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in the CCAR stress test results, as well as overall capital returns planned for the year ahead.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk through the details of our second quarter financial results. Mark?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin.","Total non-interest income decreased $74 million to $465 million. The prior year's results included $28 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that's absent this year as we are no longer in that business.","Net discount and interchange revenue was down 11%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 121 basis points, up 16 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards, which David noted are helping attract new accounts. Sequentially, the rewards rate was up 15 basis points, driven by higher enrollment in spending in the quarter's rotating 5% category.","Moving to Payment Services, revenue decreased $2 million from the prior year mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party debit issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 2% for the quarter.","Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.72% was 37 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 38-basis-point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to the higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase.","On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $4 billion. Total funding costs increased only 8 basis points despite higher market rates, as their impact was muted by last year's fixed rate debt issuances and our growing direct-to-consumer deposit base.","Overall, net interest margin expanded 31 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. For the remainder of the year, we currently expect a relatively stable margin, but it will, of course, be impacted by any changes in our planned level of promotional activity, revolving behavior in the card portfolio and any future Fed actions.","Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were down $21 million over the prior year. Last year's results had $62 million in expense associated with the operation and closure of the direct mortgage origination business, about a third of which was reflected in employee compensation.","The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher head count to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases. Marketing expenses were flat. The savings from the elimination of mortgage marketing activities were reinvested in other areas of the business. Professional fees fell $3 million.","The work streams underlying the AML\/BSA look-back project were, as expected, completed during the quarter at a cost of $12 million as compared to $19 million in the second quarter of last year. While the completion of these work streams represents a milestone, I would remind you that we are continuing to enhance our compliance program to meet the terms of our consent orders. Other expense was lower, as the prior year included $23 million in one-time charges associated with the exit of the home loan business.","Turning to provision for loan losses in credit on slide eight, provision for loan losses was higher by $106 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves in charge-offs primarily driven by loan growth.","This quarter we increased reserves $28 million while last year we had a $41 reserve release. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.39% increased by 11 basis points year-over-year and increased 5 basis points sequentially.","The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.63% increased 8 basis points year-over-year and was down 5 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop remains benign and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.","Looking at student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to continued seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate increased 25 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 10 basis points to 1.88% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come into repayment and decreased 4 basis points sequentially. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.","Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 28 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 31 basis points from the prior year and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth, which was consistent with our expectations.","Next I'll touch on our capital position on slide nine. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was flat sequentially. This ratio declined 20 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased approximately 2% of our common stock.","As David mentioned, we're pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our stressed capital ratios in the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. We received a non-objection from the Fed with respect to our proposed capital actions for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. As a result, we plan to repurchase almost $2 billion of our common stock over the next 12 months. And last week our board increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.28 to $0.30 per share. At current share prices, this results in one of the highest total yields among CCAR participants.","In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans in NIM, saw increased rewards expense primarily due to our double promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts, grew the proportion of funding we get from deposits, and achieved a favorable outcome from the 2016 CCAR process.","That concludes our formal remarks and now I'll turn the call back to the operator, Mike, to open the line up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Last quarter you discussed that you had not made a decision to accelerate growth or use some of the stronger margins to try to drive more growth. I'm wondering if you've had a change of heart around that particular issue, or if this is just a situation where you want to essentially just capitalize on these high margins and let the portfolio roll up on higher yields.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I think the way I think about it, Ken, is really \u2013 and I'll let David comment as well, too, but I think about it as a constrained optimization, right? There's a combination of rewards \u2013 of returns in growth that you'd like to see. I think we're continuing to reserve the right to invest some of that margin strength we're seeing over the back half of the year. We currently haven't found any ways of doing it that from an NPV perspective really made sense for us. That's why we're continuing to guide to a relatively stable margin at this point in time, but giving ourselves the ability, I guess, to change that if we see a need to going forward.","One of the things we did do is we did go ahead and reinvest the marketing spend from last year that we had in the direct mortgage business into some of the other businesses. You might see us lean into marketing expense a little bit as we go forward into the back half of the year relative to what you've seen from us lately. But we're pleased with the revolver sales growth we're seeing right now and pleased with the trajectory of NIM and loan growth.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Ken, the only thing I would add is we really haven't changed from last quarter. We're focused both on growth of loans as well as maintaining strong profitability.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. I had a question on whether or not you're getting similar levels of spend and lend volumes, and I know it's early days off of the record new account acquisition that you're doing off the back of this extended promo period.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, I think we're not quite to the point where we're getting expirations of the double cash back bonus, if that's what your question is. So I think that's something we'll be watching over the next several quarters. But I would say the spend during the time when they're in the promotions has somewhat exceeded our expectations, which is why we've continued to offer double.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And is the prime consumer generally, are you seeing a more willingness to revolve, or is it more the supply of credit generally expanding across the industry?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think at the margin, consumers appear to be, having deleveraged very significantly, are starting to very modestly increase their borrowings. And I think it's a very healthy amount. So you still see very benign credit, but you're seeing the credit card loan growth category across prime issuers move from shrinking to slight growth even in the prime space.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson.","Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. You'd mentioned the recent strong account acquisition growth and you said the best since the credit crisis. I think last year you were also booking some pretty strong accounts. And we've seen some pickup in terms of loan growth. Are you expecting another acceleration from these recent account acquisitions or a bit more of the same trajectory?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say, we are certainly hoping that the strong new account growth along with other actions will help increase our loan growth a bit further into our range. As you know, we're looking for 4% to 6% in total. And so we're within that range. But we are hoping to go further into the range as the quarters go by in the future.","Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thanks. And then, just quickly, on the rewards cost, came in a little higher than I expected. Did you push up your guidance for the year? I think you're at 115 basis points for the year.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think in terms of rewards guidance, we've been speaking to something in that 115-basis-point area, as you discussed. I think what you saw in the quarter was really more an impact of what last quarter's rotating 5% cash back category was, that drove pretty significant engagement and that really drove the big sequential increase in rewards. On a full-year basis, we're still looking for something in that 115-basis-point range, maybe 1-basis-point or 2- basis-point higher, but nothing of any significant different from the guidance.","Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","The next question is from David Scharf from JMP Securities.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You may have touched upon this a lit with the mix. But can you provide a little more color on perhaps the 2% sales volume growth, which looks like it came in a little below expectations, and certainly, it's not coming from over the last three months from gas price trends. Any color on what you may be seeing there?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as you know, our primary focus is on loan growth, which continues to be strong. It actually moved up just a slight amount to just over 4% from just under 4% last quarter. We don't aspire to have the same sales growth as peers who focus more on the transactor space. However, we would like it to be a bit higher than what we saw in the second quarter. And so we are hopeful that a number of the actions that we've been taking, whether it's more new accounts, focusing on engagement with our cash rewards program and other actions to help stimulate some sales volume will move the sales volume up a bit over the coming quarters as well.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The only thing I'd...","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","And just \u2013 I'm sorry?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I was just going to say the only thing I would add to that is there's several folks with some very high headline rewards rates that are out there. And I think we've just said it doesn't seem to make economic sense to us in a lot of cases and those clearly are going to be the most appealing to the transactor who tends to drive the majority of the sales growth. So with a very lend-centric model in this environment, I would expect us to lag on the sales growth front. But, as David noted, we'd like to see it be somewhat higher than where it sits right now.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, it looks like on the personal loan side, it looks like it's the first time in four quarters you're back up to double-digit year-over-year growth. Do you feel you're benefiting at all from some of the pullback by perhaps marketplace lenders, other refinancing products out there, or was there anything on the promotional side on your end that may have driven the performance?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've produced record originations each year, the last few years, and we expect to do the same this year with actions we've taken. So I think most of the growth is our actions in marketing. And it's not really promotional in terms of promotional rates, but increased marketing and increased effectiveness of that marketing, yes. At the margins, I'm sure we're benefiting a bit from the pullback of some of formerly P2P kind of companies. But a lot of \u2013 as we've talked before, a lot of where they play is in the lower credits where we don't play. So I think to the extent that they also did pick up some prime \u2013 originate some prime loans and are originating fewer that should help us a little bit. And it certainly doesn't hurt (21:49).","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Betsy.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a question on the reserving and the seasoning that you were talking about, since you are generating some incremental loan growth, some nice loan growth as we're trajecting here throughout this year, which we're expecting. Do you see that seasoning continuing to track up at the same peak that you've been experiencing over the last year-and-a-half or so? Or is there a point at which you feel that a sufficient portion of the portfolio is seasoned and reserve build will start to fade?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Betsy, I think at this point in time what you're really dealing with is the compounding effect of the loan growth as opposed to just the last quarter or two's loan growth that's really driving that reserving. The cards and personal loans both tend to take peak charge-offs about 24 months after you originate them. If you think about it, the vintage from two years ago is right at that peak; the vintage from last year is climbing the hill and the vintage from three years ago is still pretty high under the curve, but dropping off.","So as we've continued to originate more new accounts every year successfully since the crisis. The area under that curve grows, because the vintage falling out of that peak is smaller than the one that's climbing the hill. So I think it's really the compounding effect of that that's the driver. I wouldn't expect \u2013 as long as we're able to continue driving loan growth at the levels we are right now and keep solid new account production across the products, I wouldn't expect to see us slip to a situation where we fall into a reserve release or a net neutral reserve position; at least not for any length of time.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The only two things I would add to that, Betsy, is one is, even if there wasn't season, it was absolutely stable credit, when you're growing loans, you'd obviously have to set aside some loan loss reserves to cover those new loans. And secondly, there's also obviously going to continue to be some volatility between quarters, given the large size of the reserve balance.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. And then, you know how the portfolio is trending from a credit perspective relative to what you were expecting when you underwrote them. Just on a vintage curve basis, has there been much change at all over the past several quarters or not really?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say they've tracked generally to our expectations. If you're talking about a little bit longer term, they've tracked somewhat better because this credit environment has remained benign and there's been less normalization than we expected. And so where possible, we've tried to find places that we could do an incremental line increase or approve someone that maybe in this \u2013 going forward might actually be expected to have prime credit behavior.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John Pancari from Evercore.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Good afternoon. Wanted to see if you can just give us your thoughts on the targeted efficiency ratio expectation, I guess, for full year 2016 and how that may roll into 2017. And then as part of that, just see how we should think about the elevated marketing expense for this quarter if we should expect that it would abate off of this level or perhaps grow from the $198 million? Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I think we've guided to lower expenses in 2016 than we saw in 2015, but we haven't given any efficiency guidance other than to say we expect to keep trending back down toward that 38% level over the course of this year. I don't think we'll achieve it for the full year this year, and just to be clear on that front, given where the year started with some of these increased compliance and AML\/BSA look-back costs.","We're starting with such a low efficiency ratio relative to peers to begin with. Some of the one-time costs we saw just we're not going to cut muscle in order to cover those, because we want to keep the engine running and keep the customer experience what it's been. Still feel comfortable that operating expenses in 2016 will be lower than 2015. They may be a tad bit higher than the guidance we called out at the beginning of the year, but not materially so that would cause me to change guidance for you at this point in time.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And you mentioned a look-back costs, so you expect that to still go down from the $12 million that you saw this quarter?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We actually completed all the work streams related to the look-back itself this quarter. So that expense will no longer be with us going forward. But we will have other expenses related to enhancements to the compliance program to comply with the consent orders we have on that front.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks, Mark.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Operator","The next question is from Mark DeVries from Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. When you think about your levers for growing car loans, are you still getting enough traction from your cash back match and other rotating categories that we should expect you to rely more on that than on the 0% balance transfer offers? And if so, could you just talk about the implications of that for where NIM could end up in the range of your guidance of relatively flat?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll start and then hand it to Mark. I'd say, generally, yes. The pivot that we made towards match and away from quite as aggressive on the balance transfer promotional offers really starting about a year ago has continued to perform well and is one of the reasons you're seeing elevated cashback bonus expenses with a healthy net interest margin and modest marketing spend as we get lower cost per accounts. So we continue at this point to be \u2013 feel good about that trade-off. The only thing I would add is that we are continuously looking at our rewards programs, our marketing mix, testing different things. And so I would expect at some point we'll test into other variations.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and as far as NIM goes, Mark, the outlook would basically assume that a fairly consistent percentage of the growth we're seeing is coming from the balance transfer activities that we don't lean into it any more or any less candidly than we are right now that's in that stable margin guidance for the remainder of the year. As I alluded to earlier, I think we're probably more prone to invest some of that excess margin and a little bit of incremental marketing expense in the back half of the year as opposed to more BT activity. But we are reserving the ability to do it if we can find a way from an NPV standpoint to have it make sense.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Maybe I can ask somewhat of a follow-up question to David. David, just relating to rewards, it seems apparent that rates are going to stay lower for a longer period of time. And I guess, what do you think this means for the overall competitive dynamic both in the rewards space and the competition for incremental loan growth?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So you're asking me if we're going to continue to see an elevated competition in rewards. Is that...?","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What do you think the fact that we're going to be in a further low rate environment does to the competitive dynamics in both rewards and loan growth?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, I would say, in a low rate environment, transactors aren't as costly as in a higher rate environment. And I think that's why you're seeing some other competitors chase the transactors very aggressively with rewards. And it's one of the reasons we're not chasing them quite so aggressively because if they're breakeven now and float goes up, do they start losing money again if rewards get that rich. I would say also that the low rate environment and the low return environment in banking is part of what I believe is causing greater competition in cards and specifically in rewards.","And I think post-CARD Act, the issuers may be a little careful on how much they want to reduce their credit standards or how much they want to reduce their APRs, but they may feel like they can at least for now go with some high rewards rates and maybe in the future they have to adjust them down. So I think the low rate environment is driving some of that competition. And it's why we try to keep our discipline by having a sustainable rewards rate and be disciplined on maintaining profitability, not just go for really high growth but less profitable growth.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Ryan, I'd just add on to that, while it may result in sales growth being a little bit lower than we'd like to see it, in the near term, I think it's a real validation of the profit pool in the businesses and the lend-centric element of the business, which is where we intend to remain focused.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. If I could ask one other question for Mark. Just related to the guidance for a relatively stable net interest margin, when I think about a couple of different components, first on loan yields, you've talked about remixing the book towards less transact-oriented, do you think, one \u2013 do you think there's more to go there? Second, what is the impact of the fact that we may not see another interest rate rise this year? And then third, does low rates change the way at all you think about the duration of the funding base? Two years ago I think you guys termed out some of the funding. Does that change at all given the fact where rates are today?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","A bunch in there. I'll try and tackle it. I would say with respect to the latter question, I think we may let the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet drift a little lower naturally over the coming quarters just based on the revised outlook post-Brexit and the impacts on Europe and how that's trickling through the outlook for the global economy. So I wouldn't be surprised to see us do that. I think we will continue to maintain an asset-sensitive position. We think it's the right place for us. And I don't think you'll see us do anything transformational. Just, again, be evolutionary over time.","With respect to the mix in the portfolio, I would say I think you might see a little bit more skewing toward revolvers and away from transactors as the year goes on, but I wouldn't say it would be so meaningful as to change your modeling for us radically from where we sit right now. And there was a third piece to your question, Ryan, that I've forgotten. I'm sorry.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just the impact of lower short-term rates.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Lower short rates, yeah, I would say the current rate curve \u2013 current rate environment doesn't concern me at all. I think we do well in the current environment. We do well on a flatter curve. And I think we're positioned really well.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","The next question is from Don Fandetti from Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, Mark, given your capital position remaining very strong, I was just curious what your thoughts are on acquisitions. If you're seeing more deals that are of interest to you these days or if prices are still high in payments and other areas.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I would say with the AML\/BSA consent orders we have from the Fed and the FDIC, I think we're kind of out of the acquisition space right now. Those really are red lights with respect to acquisitions. So we continue to look in the marketplace, stay plugged into the marketplace, make sure we're aware of flow. But I think our ability to act on anything that would touch or impact the bank charter right now is probably non-existent. I would say with respect to the payment side of the equation, I think I'll let David address that, because that doesn't specifically play into the bank charter.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say that I'm not seeing a lot more growth in M&A. I'm hearing more talk in the market, but I'm not seeing as much actually change hands. And the one thing I would say is that even while under the consent order, it could allow us to do certain portfolio kind of things. And I don't think that M&A is the first thing that we focus on as a team anyway. We look at organic growth. We have strong capital returns to shareholders. But, I guess, I would just moderate a little bit. I'm not sure we would 100% be totally out of that, even during this period.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think you could do those portfolio purchases. That's fair.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then a follow-up. David, obviously there have been a lot of mixed signals in terms of the consumer. I'm not sensing that you're seeing any type of deceleration. It sounds like it's more steady as she goes from your standpoint.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Don, was it consumer credit or more on just consumer sales or leveraging?","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. More on consumer sales and willingness to take on debt in confidence.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that where the big action is in two places. I've certainly seen some growth from \u2013 in transactors and in some co-brand deals and there seems to be action there. There also seems to be a lot more loan growth in the subprime space. And certainly we're seeing competitors \u2013 I think it was more credit availability issue there, that after the crisis, everyone pulled back. And right now, you've got a couple of competitors who are really making a lot more credit available. And so we're seeing loan growth there. In the prime space that we focus on, I'm seeing generally slow sales growth, slow but now positive loan growth as an industry. And just gradual increases in confidence of the consumer since they're in a really healthy place from a personal balance sheet perspective. The healthiest we've seen in many, many years.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. I guess, my first question is just trying to reconcile some of the comments you've made about strong account growth. And the fact that we're not really seeing a pickup in sales growth nor the loan growth numbers, could you just reconcile that for us? Are these new accounts coming on and not really doing much? Or is this something else?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What I would say is we're actually seeing strong sales growth of the new accounts, and probably, if I had to pinpoint where we're softest, it's in some of our orders transactors. And in some cases, some of them are getting picked up by offers they just can't turn down. And so that's why you're seeing our loans and profits do fine, but \u2013 and I guess, that's how I would reconcile it.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I see. And as far as the new transactors that are coming on, they're just not revolving as much?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I wouldn't say that. Both loans and sales and new accounts look good. And you're seeing with us a little bit continued pickup on loan growth. We're getting the results that are most important, which is loan growth. And so it's a secondary concern, but we still would love to also see a little more sales growth as well. And we're hoping to achieve that more over time. There's a couple of specific things going on. Obviously, gas prices continue to be about a 1% drag year-over-year.","I think we'll have another quarter of that and then hopefully that should at least finally stabilize. You saw one of the warehouse clubs started accepting more cards and then that's going to pull some of our warehouse sales away as we have to kind of \u2013 as consumers have more choices than they did. And so we've got a couple of things like that, but overall, I think the big picture is few of our competitors are just incredibly aggressive at the moment with transactors.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. And then, just a follow-up question to your commentary on the BSA\/AML stuff. I guess, how long are you constrained at the bank as far as M&A is concerned after you're done? So should we expect this impact to be over the course of the next year or so? And then have there been any missed opportunities because of that? Or has it been net neutral? Thank you.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The good news is I'm not sure there have been missed opportunities. And if you look over the time before we got into any of this, we didn't have a huge M&A part of our business. We've been mainly inorganic growth story. But I think the key thing that we'd like to do at some point is we need to get the consent orders lifted. And two things have to happen. First, we need to finish the work. And then, it has to be burned in long enough and the regulators have to come in and actually lift the consent orders. And so we're focused right now on that first part. That's in our control. And there is no higher priority at a company than doing that. And as soon as we're to that place, we'll turn our attention to try to move along the process of getting the orders themselves lifted.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from James Friedman from Susquehanna.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Thanks. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. I just wanted to ask about the 2.39% NCO on cards. Mark, how should we be thinking about that trending for the remainder of the year?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I don't think we give charge-off guidance specifically, Jamie. What I would say is it's up, I think, 11 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And I think that really reflects that continued seasoning. I think there's two things going on. Number one, we're just coming off of an exceptionally low level for charge-offs across the consumer finance industry more broadly. So I do think there's what I'll call just a gradual normalization element of this that is taking place.","But then you also have the seasoning of those multiple years of loan growth and the way that they mature and come to peak losses 24 months out that are driving that as well. What I'd say is, just as the backdrop, I would really underscore we see the credit environment as extremely benign right now. And I do think that the trends in the credit line are going to be more a function of growth in the portfolio and the seasoning of that growth and not really reflective of any deterioration that we see in the environment.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. And my follow-up. So, Diners, not to be overlooked, had one of its better quarters in a while, 6% growth. Any commentary there? I don't remember if the comp was easy or is there something more structural in the execution that's improved?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that we're \u2013 two things have happened. One is that there's been a fair number of transitions away from Citibank franchises into other hands and other people that maybe were a little more focused on growing in some of those markets. And I'd say that transition has now run its course. But the second thing is we've got \u2013 we've had some important new signings that we've talked about in recent years. The largest issuer in China is issuing the cards there. The largest issuer \u2013 credit card issuer in India is our Diners Club franchise there. And so players like that is what really helped drive some of the volume by putting on lots of new cards, growing sales, and certainly by far the growth is coming out of the Asia area more than anywhere else in the world right now.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from John Hecht from Jefferies.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Afternoon, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, just back a little more details in some of the growth and the new customer acquisitions in the quarter. Number one, can you tell us what are the characteristics of the new customers? Any characteristics sort of by credit type or channel of customer acquisition? And then follow-on would be \u2013 I'll wait for the follow-on after I get the answer to that one.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say there's not a big change on \u2013 credit is pretty stable. The average FICO is slightly down over the last few years just as we've found that this new environment appears to be more here to stay. And so at the margin, we could lean a little more into FICO scores. But, generally, the quality of \u2013 the composition of the customers is very consistent with what we've pursued in the past. We're probably slightly heavier in students than we used to be because that's a really important source of ongoing new accounts and relationships.","We've got some new products like our Secured Card that allows us to approve people that can't be approved without the security. And so we also have our Miles Card that appeals to a little higher spending customer, generally. But both of those portfolios are so small that at this point they're not really moving the needle. So overall consistent.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, just with respect to the ramp of a new revolver customer, what's the utilization rate in the early months and when does the typical revolver customer reach peak utilization? And has that changed over the past year or two?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say that as we shifted from being a bit more balanced transfer focused to more cash rewards focused, we're seeing actually a little faster sales growth and a little slower immediate loan growth out of the blocks. But what we are expecting is that the balance transfers expired in the past. And we usually saw some paydown at that point and we have a fewer of those to expire. So the loan build, we think will continue, and continue to build. And so we tend to get to pretty high \u2013 to a fairly typical maturity around year one at the 12-month mark. And generally, our loan average balances continue to grow from that point, but more modestly.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. On the student loan business, any thoughts that you can give us, updated thoughts, on the opportunities that you have in that business? We're obviously going through a political season. Thoughts on risks to being able to grow that business? And how do you feel about that business today versus in the past and want to get that to contribute to your 4% to 6% growth?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I continue to feel good about it. One of the things that will be a bit helpful is that the organic business is becoming a higher and higher part of the mix. And so when we bought those two portfolios from Citi, they were large portfolios and they're continuing to pay down as you'd expect. But as they become a smaller and smaller part of the mix, the overall loan growth within the student loan business, I believe, can accelerate a little bit.","I'd say overall there are certainly risks. As you say, it is a bit of a hot button politically. There tends to be confusion between the large federal student loan program, which is most of the lending and it's not underwritten and it has no publicized credit issues, versus the private loans, which are continuing to perform well. But sometimes people in the press will mix up those two things. And so I still believe that there's opportunity, that private student loans only make up about 6% of new student loan originations. And if the government ever pulls back at all, that could be an opportunity for accelerated growth. I don't think we're at that point right now. But some day that may happen, I believe. But there's also plenty of scrutiny around that business because it's very important. But as long as tuition continues to grow faster, I think there's a need for it. Our loans perform well. So I am still quite bullish on the business.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up question. Just another credit question, if you would. The credit cycle. Every time somebody in the industry announces slightly higher credit losses, the market gets really nervous. And if you look back over the last 30 years of credit cycles, we're going to have another credit cycle. You guys are clearly saying that you see benign credit. If we stay in this low growth economic environment without any economic shocks, I mean, under this type of a scenario, what do you feel \u2013 it sounds like the industry is loosening its credit box a little bit. Your FICOs are down a little bit. JPMorgan talked about expanding the credit box. Where do you think the credit cycle \u2013 is there a credit cycle? Or do you think credit losses will stay around the current range? Just any thoughts? What is normalized credit for Discover? Is it lower than it used to be?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes, there's still a credit cycle. It's a cyclical business. The new normal, I don't think we're going to know for quite some time. It's lower than it used to be. But we're going to have to actually go through a cycle or two to fully understand it. And that's why \u2013 and I would just say that our management team has been through a bunch of cycles, and it's one of the reasons that we still are keeping very disciplined. We'll make some changes at the margin, but I think you're not hearing us say that there's some big opportunity we're going to loosen up because we think credit cycles are over.","So I generally \u2013 people that grow really fast in loans for a short period of time, it comes back and bites them. And that's one reason we have a top-end to our loan growth projections. We don't think growing more than about 6% at the high-end can be done today without taking too much credit risk.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I would just follow on to that just to make sure we're calibrating correctly. When David talks about a modest expansion of the credit box, I'd really utilize that modest word. I think historically what we've told folks is the line-weighted FICO in the card business is around 732, something like that for the portfolio. If you drew a bull's-eye that would say 7 basis points or 8 basis points around that number, that's where your line-weighted originations this year would be. So you're not talking about a significant expansion of the credit box by any stretch of the imagination.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Historically, Mark, I think you've indicated that about half your card growth comes from new accounts and half from existing accounts. And I'm wondering if that dynamic has changed at all given the nature of the accounts that you're currently originating.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say we're seeing a little bit more of it. It's skewing a little bit more to the new account side of the equation right now. I don't think it's all the way to 60\/40, but it's trending in that general direction, really favoring the new accounts, driving the loan growth. And I think that's largely for the reason that David noted a moment ago, those new accounts aren't coming on with as much BT as historically they did. So they have more open to buy, and with the engaged behavior we're seeing out of those accounts as they're coming on the books, they are comprising a greater portion of the sales growth right now.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And as it relates to the rewards costs, I think you indicated that some portion of it does relate to maintenance of your current book. Do you consider that to be a cyclical phenomenon or more of a secular one?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What exactly do you mean by maintenance, Eric?","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I think earlier in the commentary, David mentioned that the higher rewards cost in the period had to do both with acquisition as well as with traditional rewards, and I'm wondering if that increase in the traditional rewards is a cyclical or secular dynamic. In other words, is it just a function of the current competitive environment or is it the new cost of doing business over the long term?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I see. Well, I do think in part it's a new cost of doing business. But it's because it works. I think you can go to an unsustainably high level, which we're not prepared to do. But it has just fantastic appeal to prime card customers. And so people have been copying what we've been doing for a \u2013 since we started. And in some cases they may be taking it to an extreme. If you look at what's driving our rewards cost, there's a certain sort of more permanent shift as we move from what used to be up to 1% to flat 1%. And then, there are quarterly changes based on the 5% program, the double match on new accounts. And those can go up or down over time.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks for the explanation.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Harbes from Wells Fargo.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So you paid out essentially all of your earnings during your last CCAR cycle, and yet the capital ratio remained essentially stable at about 14%. And I think you've said in the past that longer term you think 11% would be the right level to run the business. So I'm just curious what sort of timetable you think you might be able to get there?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would say it's hard to say, Jason, is the honest answer to the question. I think we're comfortable with loan growth in the range we're seeing it right now. We'd like to see it be a little higher into the range, obviously, as David noted, but I think loan growth is consuming a chunk of that. I feel really good about going through the CCAR process and producing one of the highest yields among all the participants, buying back close to 8% of shares on an annualized basis, if you look at last quarter.","I'm hard-pressed to see how to craft a path for you for how long it's going to take to get there. I think the one thing we've said over and over again and we'll commit to it is we're not going to do anything crazy with it just because we have it. We recognize it's our investors' capital and not ours and we will treat it appropriately. We continue to look for ways to return more of it. Every year we've gotten more aggressive in that CCAR ask. Over the year prior, I think a reasonable person could assume that that process wouldn't deviate in our current thoughts as we look forward either. But exactly how long it's going to take to get there, I just don't know how to answer that question.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Fair enough. And just as an administrative follow-up, it looks like the tax rate, if we strip out the benefits, has been running around 36% to 37% so far this year. Is that a reasonable run rate going forward?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think that's a reasonable number to utilize going forward.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. And I would add my congratulations on the CCAR performance.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","You're very welcome. Question has been batted around in a bunch of ways and you did mention that some of the volume decline or decline in the growth rate was a result of older customers taking their volume to more aggressive offers. Is that something that you see as accelerating or decelerating? Are you going to take steps to deal with that? How should we think about that over the course of the next few quarters?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that we are taking some steps, but frankly, we're not willing to match unprofitable offers. And so my best guess is that it would be relatively stable. And some of the actions we're taking would probably prevent it from accelerating more.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you very much.","David W.

During the Q&A period it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated.","So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David Nelms","I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today. After the market closed, we reported third quarter net income of 644 million and earnings per share of $1.37, up 14% over the prior year driven primarily by profitable loan growth and share repurchases with a return on equity of 23%.","Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. On slide 4 of the earnings presentation you'll see Discover achieved total loan growth of 7% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in card, personal loans and private student loans. Card receivables grew 6.6% this quarter, which is a rate that continues to outpace our peers and indicates that we are continuing to take share. We\u2019re driving this growth by adding new accounts and increasing wallet share with existing customers.","The overall value proposition of Discover it continues to resonate with customers as we achieved a double digit new account growth rate again in the third quarter. We believe that the increase in wallet share and our continued low attrition both of which benefit card loan growth are held by our award recognized customer satisfaction.","In the quarter, Discover tied for highest in customer satisfaction with credit card companies for 2014 according to J.D. Power. This is a first for Discover and demonstrates our continued focus on the customer is being recognized in the market place.","Discover received the highest rating in the area of customer interaction which focuses on how card members perceive the service received through key engagement channels, such as website, call centers, automated phone system, online chat, e-mail and mobile phone. Our continued enhancement of mobile and digital technology includes developments that allow users to view account information more conveniently for ease in activate cards with a single touch and our recent release of an app that makes us first credit card company or major bank that lets card members log into their accounts using fingerprint authorization. These are just a few of the ways we continue to deploy innovative functionality for consumers.","Discover also ranked highly in the categories of credit card terms, benefits and services, problem resolution and rewards. Along these lines later in our call, Mark will give you some insight into how we\u2019re thinking about further improving ease of rewards redemption for card members.","Card sales for the quarter increased 5.8% from the prior year. More active accounts year-over-year driven by new accounts, higher average spend per active, reactivating existing accounts and very low attrition, all contributed to growth beyond U.S. retail sales. Our second largest asset class, private student loans grew 5% and when you look at the organic growth, excluding the acquired portfolios we were able to achieve 23% growth year-over-year. June, July and August are peak season for student loan applications.","During peak season, we experienced strong application growth of 11% over the prior year. Although we were challenged a bit in the graduate student loan market due to previous price decreases on federal graduate student loans. This was more than offset by the gains we made in undergraduate originations.","The increase in undergraduate originations was mostly the result of our increased marketing, our in-school repayment product and the 1% rewards feature we added for good grade on new student loans.","Moving to our payment segment, volume increased by 2%. We shared earlier this year that we will be losing some third party volumes in network partners and at PULSE. For example, the Synchrony issued Sam's-Walmart card volume began running off this quarter as it transitioned to another network and we expect the majority of this volume to leave network partners results in the fourth quarter. That said, I believe that the value that Discover Network to our card issuing business has never been greater in terms of acceptance, brand awareness and economics.","We mentioned at our financial community briefing earlier this year that we would be competing for all debit. This quarter The American Bankers Association announced their endorsement of Discover Debit. Historically banks had only two options for their signature debit cards. We want to give them another option. We believe our Discover Debit product can offer superior economics, simplified rules, fee transparency and similar acceptance. Another item we discussed at our financial community briefing when we covered our key priorities was risk management. The regulatory environment continues to be challenging and we like others in the industry are dedicating significant internal focus to regulatory and compliance initiatives.","Before I turn the call over to Mark through the details of third quarter performance, let me say that I'm proud of our operating results, great credit performance and our ability to continue to drive solid prime loan growth. Mark?","Mark Graf","Thanks David. I will begin my comments today by going through the revenue detail on slide 5 of our presentation. Net interest income increased $129 million or 9% over the prior year due to continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income was relatively flat at $552 million as several puts and takes within various line items essentially offset each other.","Specifically, net discount and interchange revenue increased by $19 million or 7% year-over-year driven by higher Discover Card sales volume. Protection product revenue continues to decline down $12 million year-over-year given our suspension of protection product sales in late 2012. Partially offsetting this, loan fee income was up $7 million.","Other revenue decreased $15 million mostly due to a prior reclassification of some merchant fees now recognized in discount and interchange revenue as well as lower mortgage related income. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 103 basis points which was 5 basis points higher than last year due to an increase in standard rewards driven in part by higher Discover it sales.","Relative to the prior period, the rewards rate was up 12 basis points a result of more 5% cash back bonus activity as the third quarter category was gasoline as well as lower forfeitures. Following up on David's earlier comment I want to share some of our latest thinking on the rewards program and some potential impacts to the P&L in the fourth quarter and beyond. We've said for some time that we are focused on maintaining our strong position in a very competitive rewards environment. And as I\u2019ve mentioned at a recent conference, we're currently revisiting our rewards program with a goal of delivering greater ease of redemption and eliminating most or all forfeiture triggers. To that end we are contemplating a series of changes to the redemption elements of our rewards program.","While not yet finalized we estimate these changes could result in a onetime charge of up to 185 million in the fourth quarter due to the extinguishment of all or part of our current reserve for rewards forfeiture. The ongoing run-rate impact of these contemplated changes should be very manageable, somewhere less than five basis points per annum. Continuing on slide 5, Payment Services revenue for the quarter was down slightly relative to the prior year, but overall we grew total company revenues by 6% for the quarter, driven by strong Direct Banking segment performance.","Turning to slide 6, total loan yield of 11.36% was up 7 basis points over the prior year driven by higher card and private student loan yields. The modest year-over-year increase in card yield reflects a higher portion of balances coming from revolving customers and slightly lower interest charge-offs. The year-over-year increase in private student loan yield relates to the PCI accounting favorability we began recognizing in the fourth quarter of 2013 which I discussed in more depth on last quarter's call.","Overall, higher total loan yield combined with lower funding costs resulted in a 14 basis point increase in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.78%. Sequentially, net interest margin was down as card members took advantage of promotional offers which benefited loan growth. Additionally we capitalized on the funding environment and issued two longer term deals in the quarter, $1.2 billion a five year fixed rate ABS and $750 million of seven year fixed rate senior bank notes. These deals suppressed some of the funding cost improvement we would have delivered had we done shorter term floating rate issuances.","However these longer term fixed rate deals are part of our funding strategy to extend duration at attractive pricing in order to position ourselves for a higher rate environment in the future. Looking forward, we expect modest sequential pressure as we continue to extend the duration of our funding and card yield continues to come down modestly.","Turning to slide 7, total operating expense increased by $44 million or 6% over the prior year. The most significant driver of the increase was increased compensation and benefits associated with higher head count to support organizational growth and compliance initiatives. We also invested in more marketing this year particularly in card and personal loans.","In addition we continue to enhance our technology which contributed to higher professional fees year-over-year, partially offsetting these increases other expense was down due in part to several onetime items that in aggregate were worth about a penny of EPS. For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was 37.8%.","As we look forward, the expense base will have a modest upward bias based on a number of factors including additional marketing spend, regulatory and compliance staffing and technology enhancements. All in, we expect our 2015 efficiency ratio to be modestly above our 38% long term efficiency target.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide 8, provision for loan losses was higher by $21 million compared to the prior year. The primary contributor was a $33 million increase in net charge-offs driven by loan growth and lower dollar recoveries. I would remind you the recovery dollars are declining as the available inventory from previously charged-off loans diminishes and isn't refilling as quickly with new charged-off balances.","Partially offsetting higher net charge-offs was a $12 million lower reserve build compared to the prior year but reserves were up sequentially. The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.16% up 11 basis points year-over-year and down 17 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus day delinquency rate was 1.71%, four basis points higher versus the prior year and up sequentially by eight basis points. The private student loan net charge-off rate excluding purchase credit impaired loans was down 16 basis points sequentially to 1.14% due to seasonality related to lower charge-offs and higher disbursements in the third quarter. The 30 plus day delinquency rate increased by 12 basis points to 1.78% as the organic book continues to come into repayment.","Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in-lines with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was down three basis points sequentially to 1.92% and the over 30 day delinquency rate was up nine basis points to 75 basis points. Across all of our portfolios we remain pleased with our strong credit results. However, we do believe our loan growth over the last several years places us on a reserve build trajectory. One last item I would call out on the income statement is that during the quarter we were able to recognize certain prior year tax benefits which reduced our effective tax rate to 36.2% for the quarter.","Next I will touch on our capital position on slide 9. You'll note that in addition to our traditional Basel I view we've added a new ratio, an estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. This new line item assumes fully phased in Basel III requirements and stands at 14.7%, roughly in-lines with our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 14.8%.","During the quarter we repurchased 622 million of stock, an accelerated pace from the second quarter as we made up for lower buy backs in the prior period. One of our top priorities is to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. To that end we still plan to repurchase a total of $1.06 billion of common stock for the four quarter period ending March 31, 2015 the same amount as our CCAR capital action submitted to the Fed.","Also on slide 9 is our outlook for the remainder of 2014. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to be down slightly as we continue to extend funding duration in this low rate environment and also look to continue to drive card loan growth. With respect to rewards, the fourth quarter will reflect a broad 5% category for holiday shopping.","However we still believe the full year will be consistent with our comments last quarter likely coming in a couple basis points north of 1% excluding any potential redemption changes.","That concludes our formal remarks. So now I will turn the call back to our operator, Adrian to begin the Q&A session.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we have Mark DeVries from Barclays on line with a question. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries - Barclays","I want to ask about kind of competitive intensity around card rewards. I appreciate you get this question in different forms almost every quarter. The reason I'm asking is we're starting to see some offers that just cause you to scratch your head on how the economics work for the issuer. Without naming anyone in particular, I'll just reference the double cash rewards offer where you've got effectively 2% back from an issuer that's basically only collecting probably 2% of discount rate. The question David is how much longer do you think we can see offers like this? In your experience when an issuer tends to over shoot with an offer that seems overly aggressive, how quickly can you see a response of them kind of dialing that back?","David Nelms","Well I actually think that there has been more stability and competitive intensity than one might think. This has been an intense -- specifically rewards and cash back has been intensely competitive for many years and this is not the first time that we've seen issuers come out with what might look to some of us to be unsustainable. My experience is they don't dial them back real quickly but after two or three years they start seeing the profit numbers not hitting hurdles and then they'll dial them back.","I would also say and in fact in recent quarters we've seen some issuers actually dial back earlier rich programs. So that's been a history in the industry. The other thing I'd say is that I wouldn't over focus on one measure. Clearly rewards are very important but service, features \u2013 there is a lot of other things that are very important to customers. And so you don't have -- if people don't have the full package like Discover it, we think it's got a great rewards but a lot of other things. The full package still continues to be more resilient than just having one headline number that you're competing with.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Mark on your comment about the modestly above 38% on the efficiency ratio can you just maybe give us a little bit more context, help us understand what assumptions are going into that? What are we assuming for interest rates? What type of loan growth? How do we think about trajectory of the expense base that got you to that above 38%?","Mark Graf","Yes there is a bunch in that Ryan and I will try and tackle the ones that really hit the 38% number specifically. I would say there is a couple different things. First of all is we'll be looking at a couple of onetime expenses coming at us next year such as roll-out of EMV, and then I think we're also facing a number of expenses that the entire industry is facing that David eluded to, really additional compliance and regulatory functions and meeting significantly higher expectations obviously is going to be driving some of that as well.","We do continue to invest in our technology infrastructure with a principal focus around digital but it's broad based investing that's taking place as well. So those would be the really key drivers of the elements that I see taking our expenses higher as I look into next year.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","And then you noted in the release that continued growth would drive reserve actions I guess. Should we expect to see a change in the pace in which you're adding to reserves then? Is it fair to assume that you\u2019re starting to see some higher credit losses in the more recent vintages that is driving this comment or is it just that it's a function of growth?","David Nelms","I think Ryan it's really a function of growth. I think the key thing to bear in mind is the vintages are generally seasoning in line with our expectations. But I would also point out that we're coming into the period of time now or if you think about peak losses occurring on a card book somewhere generally between 18 months and 30 months after origination of a vintage. We've got several larger vintages as a result of the growth we've come up over the course of the last couple years coming into the seasoning mode. So continuing again generally to season in-line with our expectations but as the larger vintages come through it will have a modestly larger impact on the overall totals.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","I've got a couple questions, just back to the efficiency ratio guidance, I was just wondering how much flexibility there might be to the extent that other metrics don't go as planned? I mean how much discretion do you have over some of the expenses that you mentioned or other expenses in case the provision goes up more than you expect it to? And then secondly just David in terms of the above industry average growth that you're seeing, how long do you think that persists given the current competitive environment? Thank you.","Mark Graf","So Sanjay I'll tackle expense one and then I'll pass things over to David. I would say there is definitely expense leverage in the model that we can avail ourselves of if we feel we need to go down that path. What I would say is we're continuing to drive very strong growth at this point in time and feel good that our ability in the near term to keep doing that. So it doesn't feel like the time you would want to be pulling back on those levers, all right. So that's why I think we're kind of indicating we expect to see some increased expenses next year because we're choosing to keep those engines running to keep that production coming online at this point in time. David?","David Nelms","And Sanjay on the growth, I think we're very pleased that again we performed well above the targeted range that we had laid out a few years back. And I think one of the things that's happening -- well two things are happening. One is we're seeing good results from Discover it, the new features, free FICO, security things that we're putting in place, our advertising and I think we're starting to get an industry that is maybe showing a little more signs of modest growth. We've been growing despite a shrinking industry.","And so I think that if the industry itself picks up a little bit then that obviously would be helpful for our ability to continue to grow as robustly as we are as we have been the last two quarters certainly. So probably early next year we'll be actually revisiting and trying to make a decision do we stick with that original guidance that we gave a few years back or do we change it and the industry and our results will be informative in that decision.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Mark, I had a question on the calculus of growth driven reserve building. So let's say that we remain in an environment where A, there is no evidence of credit deterioration and B, you continue to grow loans. If we hold everything else constant to isolate the impact, how do you think about the interplay between the tailwind that you get from the additional interest income that you generate on your loan growth and the headwind from higher provision expense associated with the need to build reserves on a growing book? Just factually speaking, what's the math of netting those pieces together in terms of the impact on EPS growth?","Mark Graf","That's a really big question that can have an awful lot of calculus impacting both ends of that equation, so how about if I just tell you about the pieces of the puzzle that go into each of them? Because we don't provide EPS guidance, I will stay away from the specific correlation between the two. I guess what I would say is that provisioning itself as I said earlier and as you noted in your question it's really going to be dictated going forward by loan growth.","The seasoning of the new vintages, some of the vintages that are coming through are slightly larger than some of the vintages that we've seen before. So that will -- again they're seasoning generally in-line with our expectations but the vintages themselves are slightly larger. The other things that go into the calculus on that side of the equation really are going to be recoveries, right? What is the trajectory at which we continue to realize recoveries off that declining pool but nevertheless still out there of crisis period charge-offs? I would say the economic environment comes into it, bankruptcy filings come into it.","So I think there is a lot of different things. I think our comments are really kind of directed at helping you kind of get the fact that the larger vintages are starting to mature. So we do believe that growth will drive incremental provisioning expense, but again I would underscore we don't see any fundamental changes in the economic environment at this point in time.","On the net interest income side, again a lot of things taking place there because it depends on the components of growth, right? Are you bringing in lower priced tiers of new accounts? Higher priced tiers of new accounts? Is there a level of promotional activity taking place? What are you doing with your funding costs, both in terms of the market rate environment as well as what levers are that we're pulling right now to fix costs and extend duration on our funding, right?","As I said in my prepared comments we're purposely taking our funding costs slightly higher so that we perform better in a rising rate environment locking those in for long periods of time for tranches of the funding. So there is a whole bunch of pieces of the puzzle that go into that that aren't necessarily inter-related but those are the basic levers.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Okay and on a related note regarding your reserving methodology. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re 100% correct in estimating your allowance today, does that mean that the sum of your net charge-offs for the 12 months would total your current period allowance?","Mark Graf","It would be forward looking. I am trying to process the question.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Yes I mean I guess if it's different, so I mean I guess to the extent that the sum of your charge-offs over the next 12 months is the driver of what your reserve is and you could have -- and you\u2019re 100% correct in estimating what those next 12 month charge-offs are going to be is that what your reserve is today? Or if it's different then why would it be different?","Mark Graf","Generally speaking yes, there is a couple little puts and takes around the edges but for the sake of simplistic answer to the question, yes that would be correct.","David Nelms","And we reserve for interest charge-offs as well Bill, unless some of our competitors don\u2019t have it going through that allowance line.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Okay. So then the related part of that -- then as if we look historically at that relationship between what your actual next 12 month charge-offs have been and your allowance any differences between the two would essentially be attribute to kind of like misestimation because intend all along would be to set the allowance equal to what you expect that next 12 months charge-offs to be?","David Nelms","I would say the mathematical answer to that question is yes. I would also point out to you though that in the history of mankind other than playing dumb luck I don\u2019t think anybody has ever nailed their reserve.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Arnold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets","A couple of my questions already got taken but just wondering if you can comment on your thoughts on Apple Pay and any other mobile payment initiatives you are undertaking? Thanks.","David Nelms","Well I would say that we're excited about that potential prospect of mobile payments generally. I think that it's likely mobile payments are likely to -- well we've been hoping they took off faster. It always seemed to take a little longer than you would like but I think mobile payments has their prospect to have more going into our cards as opposed to cash and check to add more features and functionality to consumers and their purchasing which I think is good for customers and good for our industry. So just generically we're excited about the various mobile efforts in the industry and there is obviously a number of them going on right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli - William Blair","I guess maybe a follow-up on that question if you could. Do you expect to be in the Apple Pay? How successful do you think the Apple Pay product will be and what differentiates it from other things that are out there? Was Discover's relationship with PayPal a reason why Discover is not initially in Apple Pay and how is your relationship with -- what are your expectations for that relationship with PayPal now that they're spinning off?","David Nelms ","Well look I wouldn't want to talk specifically about any of our relationships. We have a lot of important relationships and one of our strategies is to be a great partner to a bunch of people. And I would say that we certainly do expect to be participating in Apple Pay. We don't know when that will be, but we'll be actively working to be included over time.","Bob Napoli - William Blair","Okay. Then let me just ask about your consumer loan business I guess. The growth rate there is still continues to be very strong but it has slowed down a little bit. The yield has come in a little bit on that product. Are you seeing more competition? And if so are you seeing any competition from peer-to-peer? Or is it from other banks that are looking at that market as being very attractive? And do you think you can continue to grow that business at rates somewhere near where you have been recently?","Mark Graf","Yes, Bob, it's Mark. I will start with that and then pass to David with respect to the yield question on the personal loan business. It's come down slightly as more of the recent vintages really are coming in with shorter durations at origination than they had historically. Remember these are fixed rate products so as they are on a shorter duration the yields are going to be a little bit lower. So you get lower yields but you also from an asset liability management perspective as we look forward to a rising rate environment there is benefit to that fixed rate product being shortened up a bit as well. And respect to the performance to business I will pass to David for that part.","David Nelms","I would say there is certainly more competition in that business than there was but I would say that we\u2019re also participating a little more broadly than we were. We mentioned at our Investor Day that we previously did not even consider people that responded -- we had to give an invitation to apply to even be considered for Discover personal loan and we have started testing into unsolicited applications although we still are very much -- we have very strict credit criteria to manage the credit well.","So I think that percentage growth rates in that business may decline a little bit but the dollars I think have continued -- of growth have continued to be very strong, that business is now much larger than it was for us a few years ago. So we\u2019re growing off of a lower base, but we're still you know -- our business is growing north of 20% a year. I'm very happy with the growth rates while managing the credit and the yield.","Bob Napoli - William Blair","Who is the competition? Are you seeing incremental competition there?","David Nelms","Well you mention the P-to-P. They started P-to-P, I don't think they really are anymore but there are some very fast growing and very aggressive kind of non-traditional bank players and some of the more traditional banks are also perking up a bit in this space. But generally you know I think the last two or three years we think we have been the number one originator of personal loans in the country and we continue to be a very -- it continues to be a very good business for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Donald Fandetti from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup","David, I just want to ask broadly on the consumer. I just wanted to clarify, are you seeing any type pickup in appetite for consumer credit? And if so are you noticing any differential between up and down the credit spectrum and you know are there any -- we have seen a lot of the health, at least on the spend side it's been the affluent and trying to get a sense if you are seeing a broadening out or just a general update?","David Nelms","As I\u2019ve mentioned before I\u2019ve seen a little bit of a pickup in industry loans and I don't think I am seeing anything real dramatic but I would say the more middle class consumer is typically more likely to revolve some or all of their products and I think what we're seeing is a little bit more confidence by the consumer to revolve some of their debt. And so I think that's leading to a percent or two faster growth rate for the industry.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup","Okay, and then Mark on capital I was just curious if you think you will ultimately need some more preferred as you get into 2016. I know that\u2019s further out, but just want to get an update given what we saw at American Express.","Mark Graf","Yes we did issue about 575 million back in late 2012 because we only had common equity in our capital structure any significant degree. We didn't include a preferred issuance in our 2014 CCAR and we are still in the planning phases at this point in time obviously for the 2015 CCAR. So I can't comment on it specifically at this point in time although I would just begin reiterate what we've said before and that is our goal in that CCAR process is to have a prudently aggressive ask, because we fully recognize that our shareholders would like some more capital returns.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank","We talked a lot about competition and the rewards space particularly in the prime revolvers. How quickly does that extend into pricing and then subsequently terms and conditions?","David Nelms","Are you talking David, about APR competition?","David Ho - Deutsche Bank","Right for spreads and just underlying maybe folks moving down the credit spectrum a little more.","David Nelms","Well I would say I've seen a fair amount of stability in both pricing and credit aggressiveness. I'm not seeing with very rare exceptions, I'm not seeing people get back into subprime credit cards and I think that the pricing has been pretty stable for the industry in part because people you know (indiscernible) people know that the price they have to set they have to live with for potentially 10 - 20 years and so I think people are being careful to have an adequate spread.","I would also say there has been some consolidation of the industry and the people that are left are probably not going to underprice and I think historically there were some that underpriced and then came back with price increases afterwards.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And just a follow-up on the higher efficiency ratio target for 2015, how much of that would be a build and marketing spend? It wasn't really mentioned. Kind of where are the different areas that you will be investing in marketing? Will it be broad based, the launch of checking maybe some new products and how sticky are these compliance and regulatory costs as maybe the new run-rate going forward?","David Nelms ","Yes, I would say we aren't prepared yet to quite break down the components of that growth for next year. I think we just kind of put them into those broad categories and aren't going to attribute them yet. But I guess without reference to specific numbers what I would say is I think we continue to see great new account acquisition numbers and good loan growth, so I think some continued investment in the marketing space, additional investment in the marketing space is clearly going to make sense both in the card space as well as for certain other products.","The regulatory expenses David, I would tell you bluntly, are sticky, all right? I mean I think there is a new higher level of expectation to which the whole industry is being held. I don't think this is unique to us in terms of what you're hearing on this front. It's really across the industry that there are much, much higher regulation and compliance expectations and those drive costs. So I would say those are going to be sticky costs going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Police go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","I mean there is a lot of talk about more competitive environment and marketing spending and alike, can you just talk about the trajectory of costs to put accounts on the books because I mean that\u2019s been a key competitive advantage of yours in terms of your account acquisition cost.","David Nelms","Moshe, I would say that's been relatively stable for us. I think that we've continued to move more and more to online verses the traditional direct mail and if you do that well that can be a cost savings. I also think that we have invested very heavily in having a differentiated product that appeals more to consumers, has a better pull rate. So we're continuing to basically make our product more and more appealing so that it's not just pricing as I mentioned before. It's service, it's brand perceptions, it's a lot of work to create more differentiation and that is helping us to I think sustain an average cost per account that you know might otherwise be under pressure if we didn't do any of those things and just watched the competition come back into the market.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","And just as a kind of follow-up, you know the change that you're making in terms of the rewards, forfeiture rewards, should we think about that cost as somewhat additive as we go -- as we think about the level of rewards expense or is that kind of baked into the numbers that you talked about?","Mark Graf","There is two component pieces there. The 185 million is a onetime charge to basically extinguish the reserve that's set up on the balance sheet now that's been built-up over a number of years. The five basis point run-rate expense, yes I think you should think that as a marginal increase in the rewards cost. It probably won't be quite that high. I think I said it will be up to five basis points or somewhat less than five basis points I think is exactly what I said. Depending upon component parts and pieces we choose so it's going to be very manageable.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matthew Howlett from UBS. Please go ahead.","Matthew Howlett - UBS","Just on I guess oil prices if they continue to tread lower or stay down here does that have impact on spend volume? And then I guess no one has touched on the private [ph] student lending that appears to be flattish, just didn't know what was going over there and then maybe if you could just comment on the home lending segment where you are -- it seems like margins are starting to turn there and kind of better volume here in the back half of the year into '15?","David Nelms","Well certainly gas prices all other things equal will depress a bit the sales gain because order of magnitude about 10% of credit card sales tend to be gas prices. So you can kind of multiply through and figure out what the impact is on total sales as gas prices go up or down. The knock on effect is that if people are paying less on gas then it tends to be somewhat helpful for credit. People may have more discretionary spend to put into other items besides gas. So there may be some off sets but all other things equal it does suppress sales a little bit if gas prices are down.","In terms of student loans as I mentioned, I'm very pleased with the growth that we achieved. You know we always do report both on the organic portfolio and the acquired portfolio and so obviously the acquired portfolio which was sizeable when we purchased, it will continue to paydown as those students finish paying their loans in full, and so if you look at the organic growth portfolio you know we were up by more than 20% year-over-year. So that's quite healthy growth.","Matthew Howlett - UBS","Just real quickly, any update on the home mortgage segment?","David Nelms ","Home mortgage continues to be a challenge. I think we had -- you know it is slightly suppressing our overall earnings you know maybe a penny a quarter. So it's not a big driver of our bottom line. It was never a big positive either, but the combination of a difficult business environment and a difficult regulatory requirements make that business challenging. I don't see either of those factors changing any time real soon.","Matthew Howlett - UBS","You\u2019re still strongly committed to growing that? I mean could you look at possibly acquisitions? I mean is that something you still feel strongly about when you got into it?","David Nelms","I would say that we\u2019re still figuring that out. I think that if you look back from -- we would have expected from the time we bought it four years ago to today we would have expected it to be you know further along but there has been a lot of changes, regulatory market, etcetera, since that time. So we are looking at options of what more do we need to do to make it more significant and a contributor.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","Can you just talk about the -- is there a business benefit from eliminating that forfeiture reserve? Can they have lower attrition rates, higher customer satisfaction?","David Nelms","We think that there is a business benefit, that's why we would be doing it. I think that one of the -- as we research rewards customers are pretty focused on an easy and good redemption process. It gives them more confidence since they earn these rewards that they know they're going to be able to actually redeem it. And historically our breakage was a much bigger savings if you will for the company. But between our card attrition which has come down to extraordinarily low levels, our delinquency rates which have come down to extraordinarily low levels. The ease of which we have given people -- we have made it so much easier to redeem through for instance Amazon Instant in any amount, so the breakage has come down to well below -- has come down to five basis points or lower which means we have to kind of say well could we cost effectively satisfy customers even more? And we would expect that both attracting new customers to our franchise as well as not losing customers and getting more wallet share that it wouldn't take much movement in any of those levers to offset five basis points of higher cost.","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","Okay and then just update us on the rewards checking and rewards for that when they become meaningful show up in same reward line as card rewards?","David Nelms","Yes, they would.","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","Are they meaningful yet?","David Nelms","No, they are not meaningful at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My question also relates to what many of the questions are getting at as it relates to rising rewards cost and some of the other competitive dynamic that's playing out. I guess many financial institutions have suggested that they're willing to erode margins, cannibalize margins in order to improve customer loyalty and growth and as you have noted yourself you\u2019re seeing a pickup in that growth. I guess I'm wondering at what or how much are you willing to essentially erode your own margins in order to stay on the growth trajectory that you're on?","You're operating well above the ROA hurdle, so some of the concern is that this business could quickly become a race to the bottom in terms of pricing competition not on APRs but in terms of rewards cost. I'm just trying to get a better sense as to how you think that the margin dynamic, the ROA dynamic plays out? How far are you willing to go in order to maintain your growth trajectory?","David Nelms","Well I would say generally we are seeing people copy us. I mean people don't have the loyalty that we have. Historically people were not as focused on rewards as we've been. So I think when you look at competitors the big switch is they have moved their marketing from a mix of rewards and non-rewards to now almost all rewards and that would erode their margins whereas we have certainly invested more in cash back bonus [ph], you know a number of years ago we were closer to 80 basis points, we\u2019re now a bit north of 100 basis points of rewards cost.","We have put in place the 5% program. We've got merchant funded rewards which doesn't hit our bottom line but benefits customers. As Mark mentioned we\u2019re considering reducing breakage which drives up costs but also satisfaction but we\u2019re being very careful do it in a levered and sustainable way so that we never get in the position of having to devalue rewards the way many of our competitors have over time.","Mark Graf","I think you know the best fact that I can point to, to kind of underscore what David is talking about is if you look at year-over-year growth in receivables in the card space by far the largest component of that was just regular way spending, all right? So as people building receivables the old fashioned way, going out and using their Discover Card. So it doesn't feel like we're faced with anything like that kind of a decision at this point.","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess as you kind of look out, I mean your success has been tremendous in many respects and you have pointed out a number of those. I guess it feels like the competition has maybe awoken to some of what's going on and I guess I am trying to understand if there is a backdrop for them to essentially become more competitive to the point where you all just are willing to see some of the growth that's maybe out there otherwise.","David Nelms","I would say they woke up 10 years ago. I mean before that, we were pretty much the only game in town on cash rewards and now everyone has one or multiple cash programs, and so I'm not seeing any kind of inflexion point at this point. I just think that we\u2019re -- I think this very competitive rewards competition is not going to go away. It's the new normal but it has been for quite some time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill","I wanted to ask on the strategy you\u2019ve had well certainly in the third quarter than in prior quarters, also have -- of basically trading call it a little bit of NIM for extended maturities, is that a strategy we can expect you to continue assuming market conditions remain opportunistic?","Mark Graf","Yes, I think that absolutely is a strategy you would expect to see us continue. I think we\u2019re just being realists in looking and saying in the future, we are not smart enough to tell you exactly when rates change but we are pretty confident there is really only one direction they can go and a balance sheet is a dynamic thing and continuing to take the right actions as inflows [ph] to make sure we are positioned from an asset liability management and earnings standpoint, the best we can. Yes we'll sacrifice some current margin right now to make sure we got that right.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sameer Gokhale from Janney Capital. Please go ahead.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital","Just a couple questions, going back to that $185 million charge and some of your commentary, David about I think you referenced the five basis points number as the forfeiture rate currently and if I heard you correctly I think you had attributed part of the decline in the forfeiture rate to improvements in credit quality as fewer charge-offs and so you have more redemptions. But if you assume that right now we\u2019re at a kind of a trough in terms of charge-offs and then charge-offs while relatively stable are likely to only move higher compared to where they're at now why eliminate all of that reserve now? Why not wait a little bit to see how that plays out? I mean I'm just curious about -- and again I think Mark I heard you say that all of that $185 million was just eliminating all of that forfeiture reserve.","Mark Graf","Yes, so a couple things just to level set you before David answers there Sameer, what we said as we could do up to the 185. The 185 would be eliminating all of the forfeiture reserve. The other thing I would say is that you know we're considering a number of different pieces and there is still a few decisions to be made around that but we wanted to guide you towards you know what it could be. And then I think the other piece of the puzzle is the five basis points you're referencing. That is the ongoing incremental costs we will incur on our rewards rate as a result of having done that. It's not our current forfeiture rate.","And it will actually be somewhat less than that five, I think we kind of hung five out there and said it would be somewhat less than that. We think we can manage that down a little bit. So there will be some incremental impact but probably not that full five. So that\u2019s just to align all the math there and now I will pass it over to David.","David Nelms","Yes and I would say that we -- while I accept the point that delinquencies are at a low point likely now we don't expect them to go back to what they were for the industry or for us you know five years plus ago. And other than that the changes in terms of our loyalty rate as well as the changes that we've put in place like the Amazon redemption are more structural changes that we've put in place and we don\u2019t -- if anything we would expect breakage to become less and less as we try to replicate the success of things like Amazon maybe with some other people.","So I don't think that the five basis points is suddenly going to grow to some you know higher number. I think it would be a modest cost for an anticipated good marketing and customer gain.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital","Okay. And then you know on a different note you know just going back to your funding mix and deposits, you may have talked a few quarters ago but if you could refresh my memory when you look at the direct-to-consumer verses broker deposits, you know broker deposits have been growing -- direct-to-consumer deposits have been relatively flat and of course DTC [ph] seems to be more economical for you, brokerage, a little more expensive. So how do you think about that mix going forward and perhaps emphasizing direct-to-consumer more again or should we expect broker to continue to grow as a channel?","Mark Graf","I would say as an organization we would always have a decided preference for the direct-to-consumer because it comes with a customer relationship and that gives us opportunities to cross sell and more effectively serve them.","If you look at the component parts and pieces the direct-to-consumer business -- we built up pretty quickly in the crisis, right, and we built it by being a rate payer. Over the course of the last 3 to 4 years we\u2019ve gone through a very purposeful exercise to basically reposition ourselves in the rate tables and shake out what I would call our retail capital market depositors sitting in the DTC space. That\u2019s been a big part of what's driven our asset sensitivity we currently have on the balance sheet. So while DTC looks flat over the course of the last couple years, if you looked at components you would actually see good solid top line growth that isn't quite so rate driven and attrition of the folks with a beta of one or greater out of that book. The DTC, look it's a cost effective way for us to get some duration in the market place pretty effectively and pretty easily.","David Nelms","Brokered.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital","Excuse me, the brokered. Thank you, David. I appreciate that. It's a cost effective way for us to get some duration in the market place. And the other thing is we tend to use it as we head into the holiday season as we ramp up and see seasonality in the book as well because it's easy to flex up and then run back off after that period of time also. So we use it both for duration and we also use it for short term needs.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital","So at what point do you think you will have that attrition done in the DTC deposit base of the folks with betas more than one?","Mark Graf","I think it's an ongoing process right, because a bunch of that book historically was CDs. So as those maturities occur and I think you get our CD maturity schedule in our Annual Investor Day packet, you can look back on that one and kind of see what the maturities were coming at us and that will give you a good way to approximate what that rotation looks like.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to William Franklin for final remarks.","Bill Franklin","Thanks Adrian. And thank you everyone for joining us.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Discover Financial Services Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Head of Investor Relations, Tim Schmidt. You may begin your conference.","Timothy Schmidt - Discover Financial Services","Thank you, Julie, and a sincere thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the second quarter 2017 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer.","After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David, who will begin his remarks on page three of the presentation.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Tim, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. For the second quarter, we delivered net income of $546 million, earnings per share of $1.40, and a return on equity of 19%. Mark will review the financial results in more detail in a moment, but first I'd like to update you on our progress in achieving our vision, strategic objectives and shareholder value goal which are outlined on slide three. We achieved our goal of creating long-term shareholder value by generating profitable, disciplined growth.","In our lend-centric business model, profitable growth requires diligent management of several key metrics, such as net interest margin, operating expenses, credit costs and loan growth. We prudently managed our net interest income and operating expenses as our net interest margin and efficiency ratio ranked among the best of the industry, and are meeting or outperforming our long-term guidance. Loan growth over the last few years has contributed to rising charge-offs as those loans seasoned, but it has also generated strong revenue growth to mitigate higher credit cost. Loan and revenue growth represent our primary near-term opportunity to generate long-term shareholder value.","With that in mind, I'd like to take a moment to examine the current operating environment. For the first time since 2009 industry-wide card charge-off rates have registered a sustained rise, we believe, driven largely by an increasing supply of consumer credit. Although our charge-off rate remains below the industry average and historical norms, we've responded by tightening certain underwriting standards over recent quarters. Major downturns in the credit cycle usually require an economic recession as a catalyst. However, microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions remain favorable for U.S. consumers, but with a robust labor market, rising housing prices, and manageable debt to disposable income levels. Therefore, we are taking advantage of these favorable conditions to grow loans to prime customers.","Turning now to the quarter's financial highlights on slide four, we achieved profitable loan growth and faster payments volume growth, while making prudent investments for the future. All of our primary lending products contributed meaningfully to our 8% total loan growth, while we increased revenue by 9%. Notably, we delivered this strong and profitable growth, while holding the line on operating expenses and managing our rewards rate slightly lower. In our view, the level of rewards competition for prime revolvers, our focused customer segment, seems to have reached a plateau. In our Payment Services segment, volume increased 12% from a year ago, up from the 5% annual increase last quarter. I'm really pleased that PULSE volume returned to double-digit growth as our network team has secured more favorable routing and expanded our debit relationships.","In keeping with our strategic objectives, we've also deepened and expanded our card member relationships by providing excellent products and services that meet our customers' needs with simple and secure interactions. I'm proud to note that in the recent inaugural studies by J.D. Power, our mobile app ranked highest in customer satisfaction amongst all U.S. credit card companies, and our banking services ranked second highest in customer satisfaction among U.S. direct banks. With features like freeze it and instant messaging, our mobile app provides the security and simplicity that our customers seek. We continually work to find innovative ways to serve and satisfy our customers. And just last week, we announced a new free feature that helps protect Discover card members from identity theft and fraud. High customer satisfaction contributes to growth through deep customer loyalty, so these awards validate our focus on the customer as a means to profitable growth and demonstrate our progress towards being the leading direct bank and payments partner.","Looking ahead, we have a strong capital base to support our investments for future growth. Our strong ROE means we generate more capital than necessary to meet our near-term organic growth needs. So we continue to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In our recently announced capital plan, we raised both our quarterly common stock dividend and planned share repurchases, positioning Discover to remain a leader in total payout ratio and shareholder yield. In summary, we continue to make excellent progress in achieving our strategic objectives with a profitable and sustained disciplined approach to generating long-term value for our shareholders.","Before I pass the call to Mark, there's one more piece of information I'd like to share with you. One of the architects of our disciplined approach to credit management has been Jim Panzarino, our Chief Credit Officer, who is retiring from Discover after 14 years of dedicated service. I'd like to thank Jim for his many lasting contributions to Discover, one of which was to build a deep and talented credit management team, this team which will be led by 10-year Discover veteran, Dan Capozzi, will serve us well by carrying on our strong credit management tradition. I wish Jim all the best in his retirement.","I'll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide five. For the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.40. For comparative purposes, I would remind you that last year's second quarter results included a benefit of $0.11 per share related to the resolution of a tax matter with the IRS. Returning to the current quarter, our 9% revenue growth was driven by a combination of strong loan growth and net interest margin expansion. The reported increase in provisioning reserves is consistent with ongoing supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well as seasoning of our last several years of loan growth. Operating expense remained relatively flat year-over-year, which in concert with revenue growth created strong operating leverage. David noted that we remained focused on profitable disciplined growth, and you can see evidence of that in our 19% return on equity for the quarter.","Turning to slide six. Total loans increased 8% over the prior year, driven by 8% growth in credit card receivables, which represent nearly 80% of total loans. Growth in standard merchandise revolving balances drove much of the increase in card receivables spurred by strong sales growth, particularly among revolvers. We also achieved strong loan growth in our other primary lending products. Personal loans increased 22% from the prior year, thanks to active customer engagement with our simplified application experience and expanded digital presence. Given our recent tightening of certain underwriting standards in this category we do expect slower personal loan growth in the coming quarters. Private student loan balances arose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 12% year-over-year. As with personal loans, we leveraged expanded digital content to drive this organic growth.","Moving to the results from our payments network, on the right hand side of slide six, you can see that proprietary volume rose 5% year-over-year. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in active accounts. In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume grew at a faster rate during the second quarter with an increase of 15%. Diners Club volume rose 8% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises. Finally, Network Partners volume declined modestly on lower business-to-business volume.","Moving to revenue on slide seven, net interest income increased $187 million or 11% from a year ago, driven by a combination of strong loan growth and higher market rates. Total non-interest income increased $60 million or 3% year-over-year, as higher card sales increased net discount and interchange revenue. We continue to manage our rewards diligently, lowering the rate 1 basis point year-over-year and 5 basis points sequentially on a decline in promotional rewards. At 1.2%, our rewards rate remains below our 2017 guidance of 1.26% to 1.28%, although we expect a modest uptick during the remainder of the year as we invest to drive holiday sales.","As shown on slide eight, our net interest margin rose 17 basis points from the prior year, and 4 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 10.11%. Relative to the second quarter of 2016, a higher prime rate and a lower proportion of lower yielding student loans bolstered the margin, offset in part by higher charge-offs and a more costly funding mix. Total loan yield increased 26 basis points from a year ago to 11.98%, driven by a 24-basis point increase in card yield, and a 32-basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases partially offset by higher charge-offs drove card yields higher. Higher short-term interest rates were the driver of the increase in student loan yields.","On the liability side of the balance sheet, we once again generated good growth in our consumer deposits. Average balances increased $3.7 billion or 11% year-over-year. Consumer deposit rates began to move slightly higher during the second quarter, rising 4 basis points sequentially. We do expect deposit betas will continue to rise gradually, and at a pace which is consistent with our margin guidance.","Turning to slide nine, operating expenses rose just $6 million or 1% year-over-year. Higher employee compensation and benefits driven primarily by compliance related head count and higher average salaries was largely offset by lower information processing and other expenses. Marketing expenses declined $6 million or 3% from a year ago. Card marketing accounted for most of the decline, as deferred acquisition fees and lower brand advertising more than offset higher Internet mail expenses.","In summary, we remain prudent expense managers with an efficiency ratio of just 38%, an improvement of more than 300 basis points from the prior year, impart due to the absence of $12 million of look back expenses in this year's quarter. This expense discipline coupled with strong revenue growth produced very healthy operating leverage in the current period.","I'll now discuss credit results on slide 10. Total net charge-offs rose 53 basis points from the prior year and 11 basis points sequentially. Similarly, credit card net charge-offs rose 55 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points from the prior quarter. Private student loan net charge-offs rose 11 basis points year-over-year and 25 basis points sequentially, with the sequential increase in this portfolio being reflective of seasonal trends. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 80 basis points from the prior year, and 2 basis points sequentially. 30-day delinquency rates held relatively stable or declined sequentially across all of our primary lending products. In looking at total loan receivables, our 30-day delinquency rate declined 4 basis points sequentially, consistent with the seasonal improvement in the second quarter of last year.","As we previously noted, supply driven credit normalization along with the seasoning of loan growth from the past few years have been the primary factors behind rising charge-offs. Incidence rates on our season card portfolio have remained relatively flat, reflecting the current benign macroeconomic environment. However, an increasing supply of consumer credit, and an attendant increase in consumer leverage have driven higher loss severities. Consequently, our net charge-off rate has increased somewhat faster than our original expectations, and as a result, we're revising our full year 2017 guidance on the total loan net charge-off rate to a range of 2.7% to 2.8%.","In light of this revised guidance, I think it's important to remember that we have consistently noted that we have multiple levers available to offset some of the impact of increasing provisions when we deem it appropriate. For example, as you saw in this quarter, strong revenue growth and expense discipline can temper the impact of rising charge-offs on our earnings. So to assist in properly assessing the impact of this revised charge-off guidance, I would break from our custom of not commenting on EPS expectations. And note that we believe that the Street's full year 2017 consensus estimate of $5.98 per share is in the correct ZIP code.","Looking at capital on slide 11, our Tier 1 common equity ratio declined 40 basis points sequentially, as risk weighted assets increased, and we returned more capital to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. Year-over-year, our CET1 ratio declined 130 basis points as we recorded strong loan growth and returned more than $2.4 billion of capital to our shareholders. On June 28, in conjunction with receipt of our CCAR non-objection, we announced our capital plan for the four quarters ending June 30, 2018. Specifically we disclosed planned share repurchases of $2.23 billion over the next four quarters as well as a $0.05 per share increase in our quarterly common stock dividend.","One additional item to note is that beginning this quarter the payment date for the common stock dividend will be moved from late in the second month to early in the third month of each quarter. In short, we continue to actively deploy our shareholders' capital through profitable and disciplined asset growth, while at the same time returning a healthy portion in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","To sum up the quarter on slide 12, we're very pleased with our operating performance. With half of the year behind us, we're delivering solid financial results, with 9% revenue growth, a double-digit NIM, and a healthy 19% return on equity. In addition, expenses remain well managed as evidenced by one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. With regard to the balance sheet, we generated strong 8% total loan growth with significant contributions from all three of our primary lending products. We continue to expand our consumer deposit base to fund these loans while realizing the benefits of relatively low deposit betas. With respect to credit, while our charge-off rates have risen as credit conditions normalize in loan season, they remain below both historical norms and the industry averages. Finally, our robust capital position enables both profitable asset growth and a leading payout ratio and total yield for our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Julie, to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, the first question is on credit quality, obviously, it's been a bit more of a moving target this year for the worse. Could you just talk about sort of what specifically is driving this trend? And maybe just what drives your comfort level on the revised expectations, and what it might mean for next year?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Sure, Sanjay. I guess, I'd say a couple of different things. First of all, I'll just reinforce that by historical standards and compared to industry norms, credit remains exceptionally well below what we'd expect in either of those categories normally. I would say, what we're seeing is a combination of both seasoning of new account growth, as well as an increase in severity when losses occur in the back book. Up to this quarter it's been principally driven by the seasoning effect. In this past quarter we also saw an uptick in the severity elements associated with the back book. In terms of confidence, in terms of where we stand right now, I would say, delinquency rates have largely stabilized, and as you know, there are a very reliable predictor of what we think is coming at us over the course of the next six months, the remainder of the year.","The macro fundamentals remain strong too, you got a very strong labor market, HPI is in good shape, bankruptcy filings in good shape, debt to disposable income in good shape. So on balance, we continue to believe it's two factors driving this, the first of which is the seasoning of new accounts, and the second of which really is the increase in the leverage that we've seen out there across consumers, so while incidence rates on the back book aren't moving, we are seeing movement in severities.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And as far as asset sensitivity is concerned, obviously we haven't seen a whole lot of it year-to-date. Could you just talk about how we should think about further rate rises and its impact on the NIM?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. I think in terms of what we're seeing flow through, the market rate element in this last quarter remained pretty consistent with what we've guided to before, Sanjay. So if you did the walk on a sequential basis from the first to the second quarter, market rates got you about a 13-basis point increase in NIM. The receivables rate was about a 10-basis point bad guy on margin, that was due to higher promotional balances in the card book. The funding rate was about a 1-basis point detractor, and then receivables mix due to a higher revolver rate in the card book got you about a 2-basis point good guy. So that's where your 4 basis points walk on a sequential basis comes from. So really, as you think about it going forward, I'd say that rough 15-basis point market rate movement for every 25 basis point movement, rates remains intact. The other things that affect it though obviously, that you got to keep an eye on our portfolio mix, promotional activity, charge-offs of accrued interest and deposit betas.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good evening, guys.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Ryan.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Mark, thank you for reiterating the back half of the year guidance. I guess, when we think forward, thinking about credit, I guess, on the back of Sanjay's question, loan growth accelerated the past 10 months to 12 months, which I'm assuming we haven't really started to see the seasoning component of that. If we were to assume no change in the operating environment, how should we think about the pace of credit losses as we start to look beyond the next two quarters, given that we have accelerated and we all understand the fact that there is a seasoning component, especially when you bring on a much bigger vintage?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Understood. Ryan, what I would say is, reluctant to guidance for next year until our January call, which is when we typically give guidance beyond this year. But I guess what I would say is, if I think about the type of credit we're originating, we continue to remain very disciplined in terms of what we're putting on the books. And all the vintages continue to season essentially in line with or better than our expectation. So we continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we're approaching the credit space. I would say, to the point of pulling back a few years ago, when we saw some of the channels we were originating and weren't generating the kind of returns we were before returning to the kind of growth we're seeing today, over the course really of that last 10 months to 12 months as you noted.","The other thing I'd point out is, as we noted in our prepared remarks, we are pulling back on personal loan growth now, particularly in the unsolicited portfolio where candidly we're seeing some development that's not consistent with what we would like to see. So I think, we feel very good that we're booking prudent, profitable loans, that as we've said before in the lend-centric business model, are really key to compounding value over time. So I know that's not a direct response to what's the pace for 2018, we'll make you wait for that until January. What I would say that we feel very good about the growth we're booking.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And maybe a two-part question for David; one, the rewards costs came in better than we expected, I think, you talked about plateauing, you talked about it inter quarter that competition is turning to level off. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing competitively? And then second, you guys did note that you tightened. Can you maybe talk about where you tightened, and what that could mean for expectations for a loan growth moving ahead from here? Thanks.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Sure, Ryan. Well, I certainly think that, if you saw the modest reduction in our reward rate this quarter, even with accelerating growth, that would suggest that we're not having to pay up more on rewards to generate that growth. And so that, I think is one indicator that I feel like over the last 12 months that that rewards competition after a big ramp-up has sort of plateaued, still at a high level. But I think that, we see that in those companies that report their number of new accounts and in marketing expenses, that the first half of this year, a number of people have pulled back a bit. And I believe that our discipline from a year ago, when we saw some cost per accounts, they got too high and the economics didn't make sense to us. Other people read some of those results, and have maybe made adjustments, which have allowed us to return to growth, while growing revenue even faster and keeping our expenses remarkably flat.","In terms of where we've tightened, Mark mentioned personal loans. I'd say in the credit cards side, generally, because most of what we're now seeing, we think is more environmentally, it's not that we had credit issues. I would characterize as a pretty modest adjustments that we've made and it's really been on specific segments where we've seen some stress. And Mark talked about the higher credit expansion out there, we've seen certain segments where there was, maybe competitors have gone a bit far in the net effect to our credit as well, and the one place I'd point to is in personal loans. We've seen a lot of new players that don't have 10 years of data, haven't been through a cycle, lot of expansion in credit. And so we have a relatively small number of credit card customers who have personal loans with someone else, but those people have tended to underperform and underperformed what our expectations are, and underperformed what their FICO scores would otherwise suggest. And so we adjusted our models to help compensate for what we think is a bubble of outside credit that is affecting us.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking my questions.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, good evening.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Brian.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","I wonder on the credit comments, so two things; one, just clarification, Mark, I think you mentioned you were seeing the delinquency stabilized. Were you referring to the year-over-year comps, or delinquency by vintage or what delinquency metric are you referring to? And then two, when you do look at the vintages, are there any early signs that second half 2016 or even first, like you said, were early first half 2017, but are there any early signs that the most recent vintages have started doing a little bit better than maybe the vintages from 2014 and 2015?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. So a bunch in there, I'll try and hit it all, if I miss something let me know. I will say, the stabilization in delinquencies comment that I made was specific to sequentially, as we've seen the delinquency formation really begin to stabilize, which gives us a high degree of comfort in the guidance that we offered at this point in time. We are seeing some stabilization in some of the newer vintages as well. So I would say, on balance, it feels like we're hitting somewhat of a new plateau at this point in time. That being said, the wild card is, as David noted, we got really good insight into our own growth driven provisioning, or our own growth driven credit delinquency statistics. It's some of the environmental stuff where we're seeing the severities that has been the unexpected piece, quite honestly, over the course of the year this year.","If you think back to the end of the first quarter, the old guidance we had out there for charge-offs we were currently forecasting to be right at the upper end of that range. Over the course of this quarter we've seen the severity in the back book pick up, and really attributable to the overall leverage levels consumers are carrying. It seems to be managed, it seems to be controlled, debt-to-income ratios are great, the incidence rates are very stable. So it's just a matter of when folks do go bad and they have more credit outstanding, and so what's available to each creditor is a little bit lower. So it feels like normalization type activity, like we saw back in the mid 1990s. The last time we saw credit really normalize without a cyclical turn, and it feels like that's what we see Brian. And we continue to feel confident it's a good environment in which to be originating new loans.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","One follow up, if I could. I think over time you've been clear about some of the challenges with the aggregator channel that developed, I guess, sometime a year ago or maybe a little bit more. And I think you've mostly cited the cost to acquire accounts, as you kind of continue to read the data, has the aggregator channel produced any adverse credit results as well?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","So, I would say, at the margin, the aggregator channels have gotten a little bit more cost effective. But also we've moved away from us having a mix of aggregators. So some of our digital channels in particular have been very cost effective. So I'd say, in terms of the credit performance, I haven't seen any particular trend. It's been more of a cost per account issue as far as I know.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Although, the one thing I would call out Brian is clearly on a prequalified basis, credit continues to perform better than on an unsolicited basis.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","Perfect. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Betsy.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","A couple of questions. One, Mark, earlier you mentioned that there is some offsets that you have to keep EPS in the $5.90 range. Can you just go through some of what those are?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. So we've talked about levers over the last couple of years that we have available when these things happen, I mean, two of them I think you saw some evidence of in the last quarter, that being our ability to drive revenue growth, but really also our ability to be extremely disciplined around the expense line. I would say, beyond that, Betsy we debated giving a truckload of guidance or a little bit of guidance, and we really went to kind of highlighting with that $5.98 a share number the Street out up there felt like it was in the right ZIP code. What I would say is all the levers that we referred to are operating in nature, nothing cute intended in their like one-time tax items up our sleeve or anything like that, really are operating levers we have available on both, I guess, the volume side, the margin side, the expense side, any number of different drivers.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And I would just add Betsy, that overall if you look this quarter at a 9% revenue growth, and only a 1% expense growth, that's the operating margin that Mark is referring to, and that higher profit covered a lot of the provision increase.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. I know, definitely saw that, and yeah, that's part of the reason I was asking the question because not sure how much more operating leverage like the kind we saw this quarter is in the back pocket so to speak.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. I guess, what I'd say in that regard is, we will see a little bit of drift up in expenses in the back half of the year from where we are right now just because of the seasonal spend if you have in the back half of the year to drive holiday spending in sales. That being said, I think a wise person would assume that expenses are one of those levers that relative to our plan for this year, for expenses, we will probably be pulling on.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just one other on the credit, you mentioned the bubble of credit that's impacting right now. Are we one quarter in, two quarters in, how far in do you think you are?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, I talked about one specific piece, but if you look at credit cards, if you were to look across the credit bureaus, the total credit card lines outstanding, there was a contraction up until about 2013. And then there has been a pretty sizable increase since then, it's disproportionately gone to transactors, so it hasn't fully shown up in \u2013 a lot of it hasn't shown up in balances. But one estimate I saw was, there is about 30% higher credit lines available today than in 2013 in the card business, and some of that will show up in additional risk. It's on average to less risky people, but there is more available out there. And at the margin, you'll get some people that could get into too much debt. And so higher credit availability affects all creditors, and that's one of the things that we talk about, supply driven normalization, to some degree, we've had a couple years of returning to normal credit availability post crisis, that's going to drive a move towards more normal credit charge-offs for everyone.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","And Betsy, the one thing I would say is, just to give you some comfort, I'd reiterate my earlier comment that we saw, we've seen delinquency rates on a sequential basis really kind of level out, and the delinquency formation seems to have stabilized. In addition to that, the macro factors all remain very positive, and incidence rates which is a critical piece of the puzzle, incidence rates in the back book are relatively flat. So it doesn't need to appear to be anything cyclical, anything embedded. It's really on a percentage basis, just the people who are going bad are carrying more balances. The other thing I think that's relative to this is, I think we've been pretty transparent over the course of the last couple of years, that we chose not to participate in the rewards war for the high spend transactor. And as a result, I think we've been pretty transparent, we've lost some transactor volume. That clearly will show up in the credit related rates that we discussed, delinquency charge-off, all those things, just because you don't have those balances in the denominator any longer. But the one thing I would point out is transactors also don't tend to drive a lot of losses. So one thing I encourage everybody to think about is, there is a difference between the rate and the dollars of loss, a bit of a disconnect there that having made a decision to let some of those high spend transactors to trade, I don't think the dollars of loss we face in our P&L will be radically different. The rates will look different, again, just because of that denominator effect.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","But they also don't drive net revenue.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Correct. Absolutely, correct.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just lastly, can you just give us a sense as to the kind of things that you've done to tighten up as you saw this happening? What measures did you take on either underwriting or line size, or did you freeze lines? I'm just trying to understand what your strategy had been.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","We didn't, because we kept the discipline two years ago, three years ago, and because we're a prime competitor, we saw the industry \u2013 what my observation is the people that are in sub-prime business maybe had more loosening than more tightening. And so I think ours is relatively less. And it's just on the margin. Customers that had certain characteristics, we might tweak our models for who qualifies for a line increase, at the margin. We would adjust, who we're marketing to, where our cutoffs are for new accounts. And so there's been no major change. there's been tweaking of models for both the portfolio and for new accounts.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you and good evening.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. My first question relates to credit, and I'm sorry, I know this is kind of getting in deep, but you've mentioned that historically, you need an economic catalyst source to kind of lead to worsening credit. Our work would suggest that growth itself can actually kind of lead to worsening credit, just with the asset growth, and you're kind of seen that now. I would like to kind of get a sense as to how comfortable you are, that you're not going to wake up in two years from now, and you're not going to see materially worst credit than what you've got currently, and if you could kind of give us some thoughts around that, that would be very helpful.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Well, I'm not going to give two-year forward guidance, but I will react to some thoughts a little bit here. I guess, Ken, I like in the period we're in right now from what we're seeing most to a period we last saw in the mid-1990s. So you have a supply side credit driven phenomena as oppose to a macroeconomic or cyclical driven phenomena that's causing a normalization of losses. So the macro fundamentals all remain very strong, the labor market, HPI, BKs, all the rest of those factors continue to be very well behaved. But what you've seen is the cycle has persisted for longer, and as we have come off of loss rates that were just lower than we've ever seen, for longer than we've ever seen, I think you saw an increase of consumer credit come into the marketplace.","And I think, as folks are going bad, what you're seeing is, with that increased leverage, particularly in personal loans and auto loans and few other categories, you're seeing fewer dollars available to cover that increased debt burden. So it really is, what I would call, a supply driven as opposed to a macroeconomic cyclical, say phenomenon. So that's why we're comfortable continuing to underwrite credit to the extent we are. Obviously, we have not suspended the fact that we compete in a cyclical industry, and at some point in time those macroeconomic factors will kick-in and affect everybody. I'm not going to speculate as to when that would be. We're not seeing evidence of that at this point in time though is what I'd say.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, I understand and I agree with your points. I guess, the fact is that, there is continuing to be an expansion of credit into the sector. I think, without putting too precise of a time on it, by the time that the industry figures it out, it's probably going to be too late, we're going to be whistling past the graveyard, so to speak, and we're going to wake up with much higher losses, and some of these books are not going to perform, the way that everybody had expected to. So I mean, the follow-up question is, what do you need to see to start to pull back more aggressively?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Let me try my hand at it too, Ken. I think so far the losses, the new vintages are performing per our expectations. And so as they started going beyond that, then we would start taking action. But to some degree, I have been in the industry when there was times when people, consumers and creditors overdo it, I don't think we're in that kind of time. I think that consumers and creditors were overly conservative a few years back, which is natural post crisis. And frankly, if you're in the prime credit card business, we never shopped for nor assumed that we were in a 2% charge off industry. In fact we would be leaving a lot of money on the table by shooting for that low, and the industry was at normally low.","So what I'm seeing so far is a sort of return to what you would normally expect would sort of maximize the profitability, where you're not taking too much risk, but not way under doing it with risk as well. And to some degree this is the first normalization post CARD Act, post cycle. So there is some uncertainty as to that new normal. But I think, whether it's us or anyone else in the industry, people have been talking about 3% or 4% is being more normal, and it seems like we're just moving towards that. We're not even to that level yet. So what I'm seeing so far is normal. I'm just surprised it took this long frankly.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, I think we were all kind of wondering where we're going to show up, and I've realized in being a little critical here, it's not meant to necessarily spec and guess your actions, it just feels like there's just been a big move, and every time we get essentially surprised by worsening in credit that the market reaction is a negative one. So we're just trying to kind of better understand it. Thank you very much for your comment.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Sure.","Timothy Schmidt - Discover Financial Services","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of (sic) Henry Coffey with Wedbush. Your line is open.","Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","That's an interesting one. It's Henry Coffey, and my good colleague hopefully will follow. So in very simple terms when we look at the reserve build that occurred in the quarter, and you look at the revised charge-off guidance, how much of a jump was there because of the revised charge-off guidance, or is that kind of higher reserve component going to work its way into earnings over the next several quarters?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So I guess, what I would say Henry is that, when we set those reserves, that basically it's an actuarial model that established the reserves. So it takes into account the development we expect to see over the coming 12 months period of time, and then it takes into account number of macroeconomic factors that come in from Moody's macro advisors, and any one of a number of different providers. I guess, the way I'd answer the question fundamentally is to underscore the fact that I take you back to my earlier comment that we've seen delinquency formation moderate, the point where it's on a sequential basis pretty much flat, slightly down across most of the product.","So I think, what that should probably imply is that based on what we see right now, we wouldn't expect a reserve build of the same magnitude in the next quarter. But I would just point out that's going to obviously be impacted by any changes that we would see over the course of this coming quarter in terms of development. It would also be impacted by anything we would see in terms of changes to the macroeconomic forecast that we take in as part of that process as well. But, I think the development we've seen is reflected in the reserves we've established for the 12-month forward-looking period, and we feel that we are adequately reserved and reserved well in accordance with GAAP.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Henry, if I understood you, that you were asking, if it could get reversed, and I wouldn't be coming...","Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","No, no, no, I just wanted, are we going to see another up jump like that in the next couple of quarters as well.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Okay.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Again, it's impossible to fully predict, because it's dependent upon macroeconomic indicators that are forecast by other firms that we don't control. But the delinquency formation piece of it, all the parts and pieces we see right now would tell us there is a stabilization taking place.","Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","On an unrelated subject, student lending, you're number three. We're looking for signs of this, certainly, the wins seem to point to this. Somebody is gaining a lot of share on Wells Fargo. Where do you think you'll end up in the league tables by the end of the year? We're going into the growth reason, it seems like you're very much committed to this as a growth business. But what is the outlook, what are your thoughts going into the growth season, et cetera?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","We feel good about the season so far. We, looking at the numbers, I mean, Sallie Mae has by far the larger market share, we grew a bit faster than they did in the first half of this year. And so I would think that, I'm hopeful that we will pick up some market share from both of our key competitors, which is Sallie Mae and Wells Fargo.","Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Maybe on the deposit side, we have seen some of the high yield savings rates rise to 1.3%, 1.4% type levels, you're still well below that from what I can tell. What are you seeing in terms of inflows and outflows, and how much risk do you see from that going forward?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes. So I would say, Arren, we see on the deposit side is, we don't intend to lead a price war by any stretch of the imagination. We went through a lengthy process over the course of the last four years, five years to really move ourselves down in the league table standings, and really focus on cross-selling to our existing customer base. So we're now at a point, where greater than 60% of our depositors have a relationship with us on the asset side of the balance sheet. Over 80% of last year's new depositors have a relationship with us on the asset side of the balance sheet. So we think our betas can be sustainably lower than what I would call a typical online bank that doesn't have that synergy between the right and the left hand sides of its balance sheet. What I would say is, we have noted the betas have come back into the mix. We're actually kind of surprised, they really took us along as they did to begin to creep back into the mix, but they're still well below where we expect them to be normalized, and well below the levels we bake into our margin guidance for the year as well.","Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. That's helpful. And I guess, from the standpoint that you had a moderate miss this quarter from the Street, that you're kind of saying that the Street is in the right ballpark for the full year. Is it mostly on expense lever that you can make that up, or I don't know, if you want to get any more granular on where the difference is there. But you have very strong revenue growth. I'm just wondering where the Street might be missing things from the second half of the year.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","We decided to be a little bit more pithy in our response than to go line item by line item in terms of the specific guidance. Again, Arren, I think I did say earlier, and I'd reiterate clearly the expense lever is one we will be pulling. They still will trend up in the back half of the year a little bit because of the seasonal spend, but not necessarily to the levels we had planned for by any stretch of the imagination either. So I think that's definitely one of those levers. There is other, there is volume levers, there is margin levers, there is all kinds of different other ones we can be pulling, but we chose just to again be pretty pithy and stick to just the number we thought really mattered which was that EPS line.","Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.","That's fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good evening, guys. We talked about, I guess, the low, the loan seasoning and kind of growth in card contributing to the higher charge-off rates. But are there any other drivers of the severity elements in card that we haven't discussed, that you could kind of get into in a little bit more detail?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","One thing I would just say is that we have also been doing line increases over the last five years, eight years. And so cumulatively, we see a growth in average balance and so that naturally contributes as well.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","The other thing I would say there, Jason, that it's not really \u2013 if you think about it holistically, it's not necessarily what happens in card that drives losses in card, right? So it's really what's the consumer's overall debt burden, because we're not seeing \u2013 again, we're not seeing real increase in incidence rates to any meaningful degree. It's really just that consumers are levering, and we're seeing that leverage occur, in the federal student loan program, we're seeing it in auto loans, we're seeing in personal loans. Those will be the three categories that if you index back to pre-crisis, which show they've kind of driven the re-levering of the consumer. So if that consumer encounters an event, which typically tends to be an event because those incidence rates haven't moved and debt-to-income remains manageable, they simply are carrying a lot more leverage than they were, it doesn't really matter what product it occurred in. If they get over-levered they have a problem, all the creditors tend to feel a little bit of that pain. So I wouldn't specifically link card-to-card or personal loans to personal loans per se.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Helpful color there. And then, second one I want to ask is just on the appeal of the balance transfer market, kind of what are you seeing competitively there, and kind of what's the appeal of that market right now.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So it remains a very attractive channel for us right now. We are utilizing it particularly on the portfolio side of the equation as opposed to the new account side of the equation to reengage consumers. I think, I in my sequential NIM walk earlier pointed out there was about 10 basis points of detrimental effect in NIM as a result of increased promo balances, and a good chunk of that was the balance transfer activity. I'd say they remain very high FICOs that, 730-ish average FICO on the card book is what you should still be thinking about us, the scope in which we are generally playing, and even higher than that for personal loans and for student loans. But BTs are a healthy channel right now.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Moshe.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. So most of my questions have been asked and answered, some more than once, so trying to get on a different attack. Just thinking about the earnings guidance that you gave, certainly means that the reserve build moderates in the back half. And I know you don't want to give a forecast for 2018, but I guess, the question is, assuming that the macroeconomic factors that you kind of outlined are relatively stable, and the growth rate is kind of plus or minus where we are, are there any other reasons to assume that there would be a variation going into 2018 from where we were in the back half of 2017, whether the amount that you'd be building reserves?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","I don't think that's all been necessarily asked and answered. There is some new stuff in there. I guess, what I would say Moshe is that, it's going to depend on a number of different factors. It's going to depend obviously on the level of competitive \u2013 what competitors are willing to do from a credit perspective. It would obviously depend on macroeconomics. It would depend on any number of different things. It would depend on what we chose to do with our own underwritings. But I would say that, when we think about credit, your perspective on credit is decidedly dependent upon the temporal lens through which you are viewing it. If you think about charge-offs, we'll readily stipulate that they have been going up. There's no question about it. And if you think about it on a three quarter graph, it looks like a 45 degree angle sloping upward.","But if you think about it on a 10-year graph, they fell from crazy levels to the lowest levels we've ever seen in a long time, and they've kind of hung in there. And they've just now started picking up really over the course, say of the last year or so. So I mean, from our perspective, it remains an extremely attractive time to be putting new loans in the books, because charge-offs, loss rates are well below what we would expect in normalized terms they would be. So I guess, that's a long winded way of setting up. We would expect some degree of normalization in the book will continue, just coming off of unsustainably low levels, principally driven by this supply side phenomena that we kind of referenced a couple of times here. But at the end of the day, it doesn't feel based on what we're seeing right now, like this is anything like resembling any kind of a runaway train.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And the one thing I would add is, we're happy with our growth and continued growth will tend to drive continued reserving as well.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. And I wanted to come back to one comment that you made actually a couple of times about unsolicited borrowers performing a lot worse. Could you just talk about the incidence of that both in your personal loans and if there is any in the credit card, and how that might, how you might be managing that going forward?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, I'd say, I think we brought it up specifically on personal loans. Over half of our new accounts and balances come from cross-selling our existing, largely credit card customer base, and we're seeing a lot more stability there. In recent years, we have expanded into the broad market, and we've seen a lot, it's the lowest barriers to entry. It's relatively quite easy to enter the personal loans business, relative to student loans or credit cards or even deposits. And so we've seen a huge number of new players come in, huge growth in availability, and lot of these creditors, they don't have 10 years of data through the cycle. They talk about the great models, but you need experience and data to be strong. So there is an over capacity there which is going to tend to be in the non-solicited, it's going to tend to be in the broad market. And so I would cite the really explosion of new entrants in the broad market that are impacting credit, actually both for our unsolicited personal loans, but it's also impacting credit cards and other asset types because it affects those subset of customers.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Timothy Schmidt - Discover Financial Services","Thanks. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. I'm wondering you made comments about tightening of underwriting. You've also talked about expense as a lever into the second half of the year. I'm wondering how we should think about that in terms of loan growth. Second quarter was essentially a fourth sequential quarter where loan growth on a year-over-year basis accelerated. Should we start to see that moderate given the other two factors?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Not necessarily, because you saw us achieve accelerated loan growth this quarter even with very modest expense growth. So we're achieving efficiencies, our cost per account are very strong. And so I would say, in personal loans, you'll see some, I would expect some desellers slowdown in the growth rate for the reasons I mentioned, we'll be going back somewhat in the unsolicited channel. But in credit cards, it's not that we've been spending more money that we can now cut back, it's that we've been getting better results, and we're pleased. And frankly, the lever of getting more revenue from good accounts is a bigger lever than cutting marketing expense.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. And I would also point out, you didn't ask the question, but I will volunteer one more thing to give you some added comfort on that, Rick, and that is, that these new accounts were coming in with much lower average lines too. So I think we're being very disciplined. So yes, the growth is very solid right now. But we're being very disciplined about the nature of that growth. And again, I'd point to our experience with the aggregator channel a number of years ago where we pulled back when the economics just didn't make sense. I'd point to our statement today about pulling back in the unsolicited channel and personal loans where it doesn't make sense. And if we start to see development in the card book that would warrant doing something, we'd certainly do it. But to David's point heretofore, what we're booking continues to be the kind of stuff that compound shareholder value over the long haul.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Mark, that actually saves me my follow-ups and gives me a chance to ask one more, which is, I think the most misunderstood factor in the card industry right now might be the actual seasoning curves of loan losses. And I'm curious if you were to look and sort of index to a \u2013 at five years out, what the loss rate is, and let's call that 100. What in year two and year three losses would look like so that we can get a real sense of what that peak development, or how that peak development occurs?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","I'd have to give some time to think about that, want to get to your indexed graph, Rick. I guess what I'd say is, I'd remind everybody that in a prime card book, you tend to take peak losses about 24 months after you originate. I would remind everyone that the way you reserve for those losses, is you reserve on a 12-month forward-looking basis. So about six months to 12 months out, you started really seeing the reserve build associated with what you expect to be losing at the peak of that seasoning curve. And then you kind of fall off that 24-month peak, and somewhere between 36 months and 48 months out you kind of stabilize at, what I would call the portfolio loss rate, is really the way to think about the way the curve plays out. What I would say is, since the crisis, all those vintages are peaking at lower levels than what we've seen prior to the crisis at those peak levels, so they are peaking lower. They are inching a little bit higher every year, but still peaking well below what we would have seen in the typical pre-crisis vintages. So hopefully that's helpful for folks to think through it.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate that. Thank you, Mark.","Timothy Schmidt - Discover Financial Services","Great. Well, that concludes today's call. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us. If you have any follow up questions, please call the Investor Relations department. Have a good night.","Operator","This concludes today's call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Alexandra. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us on this afternoon's call. Let me start on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is on our website and we will be referencing during the call.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2012, and in our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2013, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the fourth quarter 2013 earnings materials, which are posted on our website and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call this morning will include formal remarks by David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms","Thanks, Bill, and welcome to all of you who are joining the call with us today. After the market closed, we reported fourth quarter net income of $602 million or $1.23 per diluted share, up 16% over the prior year, driven primarily by loan growth and share repurchases.","During the quarter, we generated a return on equity of 22% and returned nearly $450 million of capital to shareholders through repurchases and common dividends.","For 2013, we had 2 main priorities for the Direct Banking segment. First, we wanted to continue growing our card receivables, while maintaining our leading credit performance. Second, we wanted to expand our non-card assets by growing personal and private student loans, as well as to broaden our product offerings. I'm very pleased with the progress we made on both of these priorities last year.","For the full year, we successfully grew card sales and receivables by 4%, as we continued our focus on the prime revolver segment. This growth was driven both by increasing wallet share with existing customers and by acquiring more new accounts.","We drove new card account growth by nationally launching Discover it, which is built upon our leadership in cash rewards and customer service, and includes a number of new consumer benefits.","Recently, we started offering Discover it card members free FICO scores on their monthly statements because of our commitment to helping people achieve personal and practical financial goals. Discover is currently the only major credit card issuer to do something like this.","We grew non-card assets by continuing to leverage our expertise in unsecured underwriting and by maintaining a customer-centric focus.","In 2013, we originated roughly $2.5 billion in personal loans and over $1 billion in private student loans. In 2011 and 2012, we had the benefit of originating private loans under 2 brands, Discover and Citi, as we had a 2-year agreement with Citi. Our student loan originations in 2013 were all originated under the Discover brand, and yet we originated even more private student loans than we did in 2011 or 2012.","During our first full year offering home loans, we originated approximately $4 billion of mortgages despite the significant decrease in refinanced volumes in the second half of the year caused by rising interest rates.","We further broadened our direct bank product offerings by launching Cashback Checking, which has the potential of representing an important funding source for us over the long term.","Additionally, because of the housing recovery and rising first mortgage rates, we felt that it was the right time to launch our home equity installment loan product, which we did in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year.","For our Payments business, 2013 was a challenging year, but we continue to plant seeds for future growth. PULSE volumes were flat year-over-year and margins were stressed, as we responded aggressively to an intensely competitive environment and expanded our focus to target volume historically run over signature debit networks. At Diners Club, while the European environment remains challenging, we believe we have put the most significant challenges behind us from a financial point of view.","Additionally, we saw the launch of some very exciting new franchises in China, Russia and India.","In network partners, we were notified in the quarter that we would be losing the third-party issuing deal in the middle of 2014. However, we remain excited about our growing portfolio of payments partnerships and our increasing global acceptance.","While these newer partnerships will take time to ramp up, they position us well as the flexible payments partner.","Lastly, one of our top corporate priorities was to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. During the year, we repurchased 5% of our shares and increased our dividend in April, all-in deploying more than $1.5 billion of capital.","We also completed our inaugural CCAR filing and are looking forward to receiving the results in March. Our fourth quarter provided a strong finish to a record year, as our card business grew receivables by 4% versus the prior year despite tougher comps. We achieved 11% growth in other consumer lending products, broadening our Direct Banking product offerings, and we drove outstanding credit performance across all asset classes.","That concludes my prepared remarks on our fourth quarter and full year performance. I look forward to providing you with an update on our business strategy and priorities at our annual financial community briefing on February 27. Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Graf.","R. Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation.","Net interest income increased $141 million or 10% over the prior year, driven by loan growth and a higher net interest margin.","Total noninterest income decreased $28 million to $560 million, primarily due to lower direct mortgage-related income, as well as lower protection product revenue.","These items were partially offset by higher net discount and interchange revenue, which increased by $38 million year-over-year due to a lower rewards rate and Discover card sales volume growth.","The rewards rate for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 11 basis points lower than the prior year. You may remember that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had 2 5% cashback categories as opposed to the most recent quarter's single category.","Payment Services revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, mainly due to lower transaction processing revenue for PULSE. Overall, we grew total company revenues by 6% for the quarter.","Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.38% was 9 basis points higher than the prior year, as interest yield for card, private student and personal loans all increased. The year-over-year increase in card yield reflects lower interest charge-offs and a higher portion of balances coming from revolving customers. This higher total loan yield, combined with the lower funding costs, resulted in a 41-basis-point increase in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.81%. Looking forward, net interest margin is expected to remain elevated above our long-term target for some time to come.","Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $35 million or 4% over the prior year. The increase in employee compensation was primarily related to higher headcount to support growth and new product initiatives, as well as compliance with increased regulatory requirements.","Information processing expenses were up $12 million, or 16%, largely due to a reclassification of expenses that were previously included in employee compensation and benefits.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision was lower by $16 million compared to the prior year due to lower charge-offs and smaller reserve build. Our $50 million reserve build during the quarter mainly reflects 2 things: first, a $28 million build driven by the accounting treatment for a portion of the purchased private student loans; and second, overall loan growth. Regarding the purchased student loans, certain pools are performing better than our original expectations and a few are performing below our original expectations. PCI accounting requires pools that are performing better than expected to be accounted for by increasing the yield on the underlying loans, while a reserve addition is recognized for those pools performing below our initial expectations.","I'll point out that the full effect of the increase in yield for pools performing better than expected isn't reflected in the fourth quarter, so student loan yield will tick up again this quarter.","The key takeaway here is that, in aggregate, the acquired student loans are performing slightly better than we expected at the time of purchase.","Continuing on to Slide 8. Sequentially, the credit card net charge-off rate increased by 4 basis points, from a record low last quarter to 2.09%, and the 30-day delinquency rate of 1.72% increased 5 basis points from the prior quarter. Our credit outlook for cards continues to remain relatively benign.","The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, increased 41 basis points from the prior year and 8 basis points sequentially, due to more of the organically-originated portfolio entering repayment. Student loan delinquencies, excluding acquired loans, increased 6 basis points sequentially to 1.66%.","Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate remained relatively unchanged sequentially and the 30-day delinquency rate increased by 5 basis points to 70 basis points. Turning to Slide 9. In 2013, we repurchased $1.3 billion of our common shares, paid almost $400 million in dividends to common shareholders, and grew total loans by 5%. Despite these actions, the strong performance of our business resulted in us accreting more capital, as our Tier 1 common ratio increased by 70 basis points over the prior year to 14.3%.","Sequentially, the Tier 1 common ratio was down a bit due to seasonal loan growth. We were in a very strong capital position as we enter our inaugural CCAR review and we continue to generate great returns that support the capital actions we submitted to the Fed earlier this month. One item I would note is that this quarter's share repurchase activity will still be guided by last year's CapPR submission, which has us repurchasing closer to $300 million for this quarter as opposed to our recent cadence of about $350 million.","While not related to capital, one final call-out for the quarter is our lower effective tax rate. This was driven by a favorable resolution of a state tax matter.","To sum up, 2013 was a great year. We grew top line revenue by 7% through loan growth and a higher net interest margin. This, combined with strong credit performance and focused expense management, drove record net income. Despite challenges in our Payments business, we continue to successfully lay the groundwork to drive future volume and profits for the segment. And finally, we effectively deployed capital and repurchased over 5% of our net shares in 2013.","Looking forward, we expect the credit environment will remain benign, NIM will remain elevated, and we will continue to remain disciplined with our expenses and investments for growth.","More to come on all this and more at our financial community briefing next month.","That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Alexandra, to open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sameer Gokhale from Janney Montgomery Capital Markets.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","The first question was just on operating expenses. I know you've given some year-over-year comparisons, but I was just looking at the sequential increase in the other expense category, other going to $133 million from $118 million last quarter? And I was just wondering what was responsible for that sequential increase in expenses.","Bill Franklin","So I think there was a little bit of a catch-up on depreciation of some technology investments, and that made up a good portion of that $11 million increase year-over-year.","R. Mark Graf","Very specifically, Sameer, what it was, is we changed the way we're accounting for certain technology investments. Previously, we had been capitalizing web development expenses. We are now going to be expensing those going forward, and that's the first quarter you see that reflected.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So then run rate will be off of the Q4 number?","R. Mark Graf","I don't think Q4 is exactly going to be the run rate to build off of because that did include some catch-up, as Bill alluded to. But I think it's fairly close.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just the other thing, on the NIM dynamics, the net interest margin, and you look at your funding costs, it looks like you got, sequentially again, a significant benefit from a decline in your broker deposit costs. And I know overall, they've been trending lower, but it seemed like the decline from Q3 to Q4 was a little bit bigger than you've seen in previous quarters. So can you just help us walk through just the sequential decline in your broker deposit costs? And is there anything unusual going on there?","R. Mark Graf","No, I don't think there's anything unusual going on there because we've actually done 2 different things, Sameer. Not only have we effectively brought down the rate we're paying on our deposit book across-the-board, I would point out the direct-to-consumer deposits in addition to the broker deposits, we've also been pushing out maturities as we've been doing that. So I'll call it a both-end benefit. We've brought down the effective rate we're paying as we've seen high-rate, longer-dated maturities rolling off, and we've been able to replace those with similar or longer-dated products at much lower rates in the current environment. We're doing that in the CD book on the direct-to-consumer side. We're also doing that in the broker deposit side.","Operator","We have Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley with a question.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. One on, while we're on broker deposits, I'm just wondering what the decision was behind increasing year-on-year -- Q-on-Q? You had about a $1.8 billion increase in the broker deposits -- or I'm sorry, a $2.3 billion in the broker deposits.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would say it's a couple of things, Betsy, but the primary driver there is our funding strategy overall is what we like to describe as a constrained optimization. So we want to make sure we're accessing all of our channels all the time and tapping out none of our channels at any time, to have a balanced profile from a risk perspective and a funding standpoint. And subject to that overall constraint, we target the lowest cost of funding at specific duration points at the curve. And in the fourth quarter, it was a very attractive source of longer-dated funding.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So do you see that as an opportunity to kind of pre-fund loan growth in 2014?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think that was an attempt to not only pre-fund the growth, but extend out the maturity on the book overall. I think we also took down some 10-year banknote money in the fourth quarter that I would put in the same category. We didn't have a need for at the time, but it was really managing the complexion of the balance sheet, as well as pre-funding loan growth earlier this year.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So we should expect to see, all other things equal, the securities portfolio kind of tail -- trend down as you grow loans into the next couple of quarters?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would say generally speaking that's correct, but we're obviously going to be looking at other maturities we have upcoming, as well as other obligations, and making sure we're carrying enough on-balance-sheet liquidity to meet our needs. So as a general rule, I think what you said is correct.","Operator","We have Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW online with a question.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I also got a couple of questions. I guess, first, could you, Mark, maybe help us think about the yield benefit from the student lending PCI accretion in the first quarter? Is it fair to assume that it's a comparable step function up in the yield, as we saw in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, David, you mentioned a third -- a loss in the third-party issuing area. Could you just talk about the materiality of that and kind of some more color on that?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. With respect to the PCI loan yields, Sanjay, what I would say is, essentially 100% of the increase you saw in student loan yield in the fourth quarter was driven by the movement in accretable yield on the pools that are performing better. And that reflected that being in place for 1 month of the fourth quarter. So you'll get it for the full 3 months in the first quarter, and that should give you a pretty good idea how to a range it in, I think.","David W. Nelms","And, Sanjay, your second question, this is the third-party issuing deal that we've been calling out as a risk for the last couple of quarters, but we actually received notice this quarter. And in terms of materiality, I'd say, it's -- we expect it to have a meaningful impact on network partners' volumes and profits, but immaterial to EPS overall.","Operator","We have Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs online with a question.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on credit. How should we think about the pace of loan loss reserve build in 2014? If you take out the PCI charges, I think you built about 22, is that a good estimate for growth as well as seasoning of the portfolio? And just on the reserve, do you think we're at the bottom in terms of the reserve level? How should we think about those 2 items?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I think in terms of the environment overall, Ryan, the right way to think about things is, we are somewhere at or near the plateau in improvement, right? I think what we've been saying for some time is, we do expect this environment will continue for a while. We don't see any kind of inflection point in the credit environment in the plan, the 12-month-forward planning cycle we use to set our loss reserves. So provisioning is really principally going to be driven from this point forward by growth in the loan portfolio. And to a lesser degree, I think a bit of a tapering effect continuing on recoveries of the Omni-age charge-offs kind of from the recession period of time. So I guess what I would say is, they won't be -- while I say they're relatively stable, I wouldn't have an expectation they're exactly flat. I think quarter-over-quarter, economic factors and other inputs to the models are going to cause them to tick up a little bit or tick down a little bit, as the case might be. But think about it as, in general terms, somewhat flat.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up unrelated. If you look at your marketing expense, it was basically flat in the back half of the year in 2012 versus 2013. So given that, I believe, a lot of the marketing budget for 2013 was driven by the launch of the it card, so given that, how do we think about the trajectory of marketing expense from here? Could we actually see a decline, given that a lot of the spend was put into the it card?","R. Mark Graf","Ryan, I would expect you probably won't see a decline in the marketing expense. As we said in a couple of forums recently, we continue to see great returns on the investments we're making in the it card, both in terms of not only the cost per account acquired being very low, but the engagement we're seeing out of those it card members being very, very strong. In other words, they're using the card sooner and more frequently than our traditional More card members have. And I think you've heard me say before, I grew up on a farm, so I believe and David believes in making hay while the sun shines. So while those great returns continue and those great opportunities are there, we're going to keep investing into that.","Operator","We have Mark DeVries from Barclays online with a question.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question, Mark, I was hoping you can give us a little more detail about what you mean by margin remaining elevated for some time to come. Based on what you know and are seeing on kind of asset yield trends and your CD repricing opportunities, is there a potential for a little bit more expansion in the NIM over the next couple of quarters, before we see that eventually trend down?","R. Mark Graf","I would say the very quick answer to the last part of your question is yes. There is opportunity for a little bit more improvement. What I would say is I think we're going to provide a greater degree of insight to that at our financial community briefing next month. So to keep the anticipation up, I think I'm going to say more to come on that front come February.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then a separate question. Sallie Mae took a $70 million charge this past quarter on expected compliance remediation efforts related to ongoing regulatory inquiries, which we assume is tied to the CFPB's kind of ongoing review of student loan servicing. Is that something we should potentially expect to see from you in the coming quarters?","David W. Nelms","I don't really have any good visibility as to what their practices are or what the CFPB is -- may or may not be suggesting to them. I would just say that we're obviously under continuous supervision by the CFPB and our student loan business and our other consumer businesses. And so we will remain vigilant to make sure we're doing the right thing and -- but I couldn't comment on Sallie.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But has there been any kind of intensification of kind of the level of activity you're seeing in the interaction with them?","David W. Nelms","As I say, it's ongoing. So there's not -- we have interaction with them and have had pretty continuous level of interaction with them since they were stood up, and we would expect to continue to have that level of activity and scrutiny.","Operator","David Ho from Deutsche Bank is online with a question.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question on capital. With CCAR around the quarter, one of your competitors has been out warning of potential wide gap between its internal stress modeling scenarios and that of the Feds. Can you talk about how you're tackling this potential risk and potentially narrowing the gap in kind of work you've done over the past year?","R. Mark Graf","Sure. It's hard for me to comment, quite honestly, on what the Fed's model is going to produce until we actually have a chance to see what the Fed's model is going to produce. So I think that part of the question I can say better directed at them. I think if you look back at the actual results from last year, I think last year there was a pretty meaningful disconnect between the submitted stress losses and the calculated stress losses that came back from the Fed. So just extrapolating that forward, I think there is probably a high degree of probability that, that situation persists. With respect to our CCAR filing on balance, we filed what I would say we believe to be an appropriately aggressive ask a few weeks ago, David. And I think we've been pretty transparent with the market about where we kind of believe the orange cones are set with respect to payouts in this environment. And we've also tried hard to keep front and center the fact that we are required to submit our request in terms of payout dollars and aren't allowed to submit a request for a payout ratio. So we, along with a number of our competitors who received approvals for some pretty high theoretical payout ratios last year, didn't really approach those percentages due to the strong year we both -- or several of us turned in relative to what's forecast by some pretty locked down quantitative models. So I guess what I would say is, there's no way for me to handicap exactly what the Fed's models are going to say, but we think we made an aggressive ask. We understand our shareholders want us to increase the already high levels of capital distributions we've got. And within the current environmental constraints, we're working hard to achieve that goal.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And switching gears a little bit. Obviously, you're getting good growth in personal loans. Can you talk a little bit about where in the credit spectrum you're seeing the most growth? And maybe the competitive landscape, you obviously have very strong market share in the prime space. Is that where you're seeing a lot of competition? And how about near prime?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say it is very focused on the prime space. In fact, the FICO scores that we see in our originated personal loans are significantly higher than what we have even in the credit card space, whereas you know, we're a prime lender there as well. There's a good amount of it that's cross-sell. And so that is very helpful. And I think in terms of competition, I'm not -- I think that we have focused maybe more on this opportunity than others, some others who were not in the prime space a number of years ago and got burned. And so I think that is -- it means that we're one only a few that are really focused on this, and especially when you look at the prime space.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there any risk of competition heating up anytime soon or is it mostly a vacuum at this point?","David W. Nelms","There's always competition. And I think if you look at our growth, you can see that we're doing well in the face of the competition we're seeing. So I think I'd kind of leave it at that, other than we're continuing to evolve the product and to offer more options for customers, more value for customers. And so even as more people maybe sort of get back in the water, I would think we could hold our own because we're continuing to improve the segmentation, the marketing and the products itself.","Operator","Bill Carcache from Nomura is online with a question.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","You've touched on this a little bit, but I wanted to follow up on -- you guys -- on loan growth, you guys are continuing to put up industry-leading credit card loan growth, but it's decelerated a bit. At this time last year, the year-over-year growth rate was well above 5%, but now it's gradually fallen to, last December, I think it was 3.9%. I realize that you're comping against tougher numbers. But could you talk a little bit more? Is it really just the segmentation that you talked about just now or are there other things that perhaps you would expect to kickstart that growth back towards the 5% range?","David W. Nelms","Well, as you have said, the comps are getting a bit tougher, and being at right at the top end of our 2% to 5% range wasn't necessarily something we thought we could hold forever. But that being said, we are absolutely looking at opportunities to stay as close to the top of that 2% to 5% range as we can. And if we can find additional opportunities to accelerate the growth, Mark talked about the marketing spend, that's certainly one of the levers that we're going to continue to look at. We're continuing to add features. And I would note the new FICO score is unique and has been well-received so far. And so we'll do everything we can to maintain our industry-leading loan growth in the prime credit space.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up on your outlook. Can you give an update on your interest level in the general-purpose reloadable prepaid space? And then also perhaps discuss your outlook for transaction processing revenue growth from PULSE?","David W. Nelms","I would say that most of our involvement with prepaid has been as a network to some of the leaders in prepaid. It's still an evolving market. You've seen some new people make big moves in it. You've also seen people announce they're withdrawing from it. And so I'd say we're being cautious. And I think it's -- there's -- the thing that we are most interested in is doing sort of nonstandard things that are really maybe out of the box, maybe with partners. And if we can find the right opportunities, we would maybe expand in the future. But we don't have a big interest of just being 1 of 100 cards on the rack in the retailer right now. We're more interested in doing things that are really going to help consumers.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And the transaction processing revenue growth outlook for PULSE? That's it.","David W. Nelms","I think what you're seeing is that we've somewhat stabilized a bit. We're still facing some challenges both in -- on the PULSE volume and margins, which we talked about numerous times before, as well as continuing challenges in Europe, in particular on Diners Club. But we are working on additional opportunities to try to really get back to more of the level of growing profits and revenue, more like we -- the numbers we've put on the board for 5 years before this recent difficult patch.","Operator","Craig Maurer from CLSA is online with a question.","Craig J. Maurer - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Regarding your spend growth on your proprietary cards, it looked fairly anemic to the better players we look at in the segment. So I'm wondering, do you think this is a demographic issue? Or what would you attribute that to? Secondly, you discussed you had trimmed the categories of 5% cashback year-on-year in half, from 2 to 1. Was there less opportunity to go after spending so you trimmed what you were willing to spend to go after that? I'm curious because, again, the spend growth on the proprietary cards looked weak.","David W. Nelms","What I would say is that our spend growth was still a little bit higher than retail spending. So we're continuing to grow with merchants. You are right that there are a number of competitors who are putting up much bigger numbers on sales volume. One of the things we look at is sales volume with revolvers versus the highest transactors. And one of the things that's happening in today's economy is that the big spending in transacting -- transactor volume is growing a lot. And the prime revolver sales are not growing a lot. But we're actually doing very well compared to our competitors in that segment that we're focused on. And so corporate spending, high T&E, high-end T&E, we just don't participate in some of those segments the way some of our competitors are. We think that our model is more sustainable in the long run, especially when the cost of funds returns to more normal levels. And especially if there's ever any downward pressure on and interchange, we think we're in a more sustainable place.","R. Mark Graf","And rewards.","David W. Nelms","So I didn't exactly understand the rewards question.","Bill Franklin","Craig, the second part of your question was around the rewards, the amount of expense we had? For the fourth quarter...","Craig J. Maurer - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Well, it was the decision to trim the categories that have high cashback levels.","David W. Nelms","Oh, I'm sorry. I would think about the fourth quarter of last -- of 2012 as being the more unusual time. I mean, we normally would have one big promotion in each quarter. That particular year, we had 2. That drove some incremental sales last year, and we didn't repeat it this year. So you've seen a nice benefit on the Cashback Bonus expense. But as you'd expense[ph] , especially looking at that high comp last year, we didn't repeat the extra sales burst that we had a year ago.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, Craig, what I would say is that going forward, I would expect continued variability in the rewards line because quarter-over-quarter, we're going to tackle different things to kind of drive the result we're looking for at that particular time, and make sure we're getting the customer engagement we're looking for. I think over the long haul, kind of a 1% rewards rate is still the right way to think about what we're targeting. But you're going to have some degree of variability around that number quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","Don Fandetti from Citigroup is online with a question.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, I was just curious if you wouldn't mind maybe talking about the industry in card loan growth in general, what your general outlook is? I mean, it seems like if you look at some of the data, it might suggest a slight improvement in the trajectory, but I'm not sure if you're seeing that or what you think the pluses and minuses are for industry growth.","David W. Nelms","Don, I'm expecting a pickup in loan growth. I have not very many data points that support it. I mean, if I look through our competitor results, recently, I didn't see really anyone besides us and American Express that grew loans. And so I think that it's -- the industry as a whole is just kind of flat with a couple of us growing and more people shrinking. I think that as we go through this year, I still expect that loan growth for the industry ought to return to more like at least GDP growth. And I think that if that happens, then that would obviously be good for us because I would hope to participate in some of that faster industry growth, because right now, all of our growth is from taking share.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So I mean, the industry is generally flat now. So I guess GDP, maybe 2% or 3%, that's actually a decent little pickup.","David W. Nelms","That would be a decent pickup. I don't -- I'm not -- our plans across the next few years don't have the industry returning to rapid industry growth. I think there was a period of time when there was rapid growth, product innovation, balance transfer, all kinds of innovations. Big reset, big deleveraging after the financial crisis, 3 years of down in the industry, 3 years of flat. I think it probably returns to slow single-digit growth as an industry, and what -- our strategy is to continue to grow faster than the industry.","Operator","Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch is online with a question.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question really picks up where you left off with Don's question. I guess as you look forward into this slow-growth environment, you've commented that you expect to keep the marketing spend high in terms of driving your growth. This is all about card acquisitions, I suppose. And certainly, it's what you've been driving with Discover. Can you give us some sense as to how you think you can continue to gain share and what the competitive backdrop is doing within the revolving credit space, since that's really where you're going to take share?","David W. Nelms","Well, when I think, Ken, about growth, I think about it in 3 ways. One of those ways is putting on new accounts, as you say, and having strong products. I'm very proud of Discover it. I'm proud of our marketing, our commercials, our online digital presence. And that's very important. I would say that maybe an even bigger share of our growth will actually come from our existing base. We still have -- we have a very loyal customer base. We still have our customers who have a lot of spend and balances elsewhere. And we've been making good inroads to gradually move them over with our better service and value, but that's the best place to pick up growth. And the third area is retention. And as long as we can maintain lower charge-offs and lower attrition because we're keeping our customers happier, we're not having as much of a leaky bucket as the rest of the industry has. And so I would think about those 3 together, and growing an extra 1% faster, 2% faster, 5% faster, I mean, obviously really adds up and will, in conjunction with the new products that we've put on, which are growing much faster than credit cards, help offset the credit tailwind that will eventually become at least somewhat of a headwind, at least from a -- especially from a provision and reserves perspective.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and just following on with that, you've pointed out in a number of occasions that the Discover it product is slightly different than some of your prior products from the standpoint of how you would expect loan growth to come into the portfolio over time. Is there any way to dimension that in terms of how much back-end loaded that might be in terms of the embedded growth that's actually coming into the portfolio through Discover it?","David W. Nelms","I'm not prepared to address that in this call. We'll think about what we might be able to share at our Investor Day on that, Ken.","Operator","Brad Ball from Evercore is online with a question.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Regarding the PCI private student loan pools that were underperforming, Mark, I wondered if you could talk about what was -- what drove that underperformance relative to your expectations. And are you seeing any of that -- those factors impacting your non-PCI private loan book?","R. Mark Graf","The quick answer, Brad, is that the pools are stratified based on origination vintage. And it is one pool in particular from one particular vintage year of originations that is underperforming the expectation there. So it's not -- the underperformance issue doesn't bleed across, shall we say, to the other pools at all. And with respect to whether or not we're seeing the same impact in our own organically-originated book, the answer is no. We're not seeing the same impact in our own originally -- organically-originated book.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So is the underperformance then related to the structure of the loans in that pool or whether they were co-signed? Or is there some other factor there?","R. Mark Graf","I think it relates to the origination criteria, for lack of a better term, that were utilized in that particular year of origination. And I think it just relates to the fact that, that particular year, the market was a little bit more heated, shall we say, than it was in subsequent and prior years.","David W. Nelms","Remember that it's versus our expectations that were made at the time of the purchase as well.","R. Mark Graf","Correct.","David W. Nelms","So if our expectations -- it may be different on an absolute basis even. But if our expectations were off from actual, that's what causes the accounting.","R. Mark Graf","Yes. So if you think about it, there's -- if you look across the pools, there are a couple that are performing better than expectations when we acquired them. There are a couple that are performing worse, one of which is really the driver here, to be honest. And there's several that are performing right in line with expectations. So if you look at the portfolio in aggregate, overall, it's performing better than we expected at the time we acquired it.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So a onetime impact, no reason to expect that there'll be future reserve adjustments related to that one pool?","R. Mark Graf","I wouldn't say it's onetime. I would think about it the same way I would think about -- but it's -- you have to bifurcate it. So it's a unidirectional kind of issue, if that's a real word. Basically, if that pool's performance gets worse from here relative to our expectations, you would see us post additional reserves against that pool. If the pools that are performing better than our expectations get even better yet, you'll look to see us post further accretable yield on those portfolios going forward. So it's -- you have to bifurcate because the accounting for deterioration is reserves. The accounting for improvement is yield accretion.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then if I may, on the personal loan book, you grew 27% this year, I think, over 20% last year. What are the constraints on growth? Or are there any? Could you grow that even greater than you have? And are you seeing a distinct pickup in demand for debt consolidation loans in the current environment?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that we feel like we're growing it appropriately. And at some point, the growth rate will start to slow down just by the law of large numbers. But I've been very pleased that we've maintained those kind of growth rates. I think that if I look longer-term, the personal loan market is a lot smaller than the home equity market. And so if you think about what are the reasons strategic we entered the home equity market this year was; a, we think the timing is right from an interest rate perspective and the fact that home equity is being rebuilt for a number of consumers; and secondly, because we think there's good growth over time in a market that is much larger, which is home equity being much larger than personal loans and certainly than student loans as well, private student loans.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And do you see the home equity product playing a debt consolidation role in the future?","David W. Nelms","Yes. I think that it's a combination of home improvement, as well as debt consolidation. But to some degree, it gives us a more continuous product line. If someone is just doing a small consolidation, maybe a balance transfer on the credit card is fine. If someone's doing a moderate consolidation, that's what our personal loans are for, generally $15,000, $20,000 kind of range. If someone has a larger amount they're consolidating or they're doing a major improvement, that's where the $20,000 to $100,000 line secured by -- with -- as a secured loan, and home equity kicks in.","Operator","David Hochstim from Buckingham Research is online with a question.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wonder, could you give us any update on what's happening with the Paypal and Ariba partnerships in Payment Services? Is there anything in revenues or expenses there this quarter that's meaningful?","David W. Nelms","I'd say that they're continuing -- there's nothing unusual in terms of expenses this particular quarter on either of those. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We've made really good progress on both, especially PayPal. We've signed a lot of acquirers and put up some merchants. Ariba, it's still in the development phase, then we'll go on to the pilot phase. So it's not going to be -- neither one of them have really -- have launched. So we're continuing to make progress with our partners towards an ultimate launch.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Maybe just related, there's a $2 million provision for losses in Payment Services. Is part of that Italy or anywhere we're familiar with?","R. Mark Graf","I'm sorry, David, you faded out there?","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","In Payment Services this quarter, you had another very tiny, but reported, provision for losses?","R. Mark Graf","Yes.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I'm wondering what that is?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, that's related to the Diners Club line of business. And it specifically as a provision related to a loan that we have outstanding to a European franchisee.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then could you just tell us what we should think about for a tax rate for 2014?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I would think about, really, our more normalized tax rate to be in the 37% to 38% range. We'll give you some more guidance on that at Investor Day. But for right now, I think that's a pretty good way to range it.","Operator","Moshe Orenbuch from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse is online with a question.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","David, I was struck by your comment about cost per account being low. And I'm sure that's going to be a significant competitive advantage. I mean, do you -- can you talk a little bit of what you ascribe that to? I mean, is it the fact that everybody else is beating one another over the head to issue Visa cards or MasterCards? Or is it product design? Or I mean, how do you think about that and how do you think about using that going forward?","David W. Nelms","Well, first, I would say we don't have great visibility as to what our competitors' cost per account are. And I think they vary all over the place. They might ascribe incrementally low costs for a branch-originated account, as an example. And we, obviously, don't originate through bank branches. When we think about cost per account, I'm thinking more compared to our historical averages. And ours are lower than they have been as -- because we've got a differentiated product with a large number of unique features in Discover it. And I think we've also gotten better at marketing it as we've strengthened our brand, strengthened our acceptance, leveraged some of our major sponsorships. And so I think that we need to continue to go to market as a differentiated brand. We are Discover. We're not just another Visa or MasterCard. We've got unique features. We keep adding to them. And then we provide -- increasingly, people know that we stand for great service, as well as value. The Internet and the move to digital I think is another thing that I would point you to, because I think that we face a lot of rejection in direct mail. And increasingly, we're finding ways to leverage the Internet and to be the account-generation machine.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the discussion of the difference between the growth rate, your growth rate in spending volume versus balances and compared to the industry. One of the things we've talked about in the past is that, obviously, you could get there by increasing balance transfers. The numbers that I would look at suggest that actually you're doing less balance transfer than in prior periods. Is that a fair characterization?","David W. Nelms","That is correct. We are more -- and so it is a little difficult to parse through because what you don't see is the mix. If we just backed off from balance transfer, and that was the only change, then you'd see maybe sales growing faster than receivables. But as I say, we kind of look at revolvers versus transactors. And we are fundamentally giving up share purposefully in transactors, and we're gaining shares on prime revolvers. And that's why the numbers are -- sales and receivables for the year were both up by about 4%. And that's pretty well matched up.","R. Mark Graf","And Moshe, if you look at the growth on the quarter, about 2\/3 of it comes from what I would call regular way[ph] spend and about 1\/3 -- only about 1\/3 of that is going to come out of any type of promotional activity, of which BT is only a subset of that 1\/3. So the nature of the growth in the quarter from my perspective feels very, very healthy.","David W. Nelms","And we have a healthy payment rate, and it's -- but it's pretty stable. If you look at most of our competitors, their payment rates are continuing to rise. So they're basically bringing money in and it's more being paid off at a faster and faster rate. And we're not doing that.","Operator","Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill is online with a question.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Mark, just wanted to ask one more question on the private student loans and the timing of the recognition on the accretable yield. Is that safe to assume we're talking a number that's a little north of $28 million that gets spread out over something like 5 to 10 years?","R. Mark Graf","It's going to be spread out over about 5 years or so. In terms of timing, in terms of the way to think about it and from the standpoint of more or less a specific number, what I guide you back to is essentially 100% of the increase in yield in the fourth quarter was driven by that accretion. And that represented only 1 month's worth of inclusion of that accretion. So you can kind of calculate what a full month's worth of that would look like and extrapolate that over 5 years with a slightly declining balance due to payoffs, and you'll get to your number.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it, okay, all right. That helps me on that. And then just to ask a hypothetical with the news on PayPal. There's nothing that, as far as PayPal is separated from eBay, that would trigger any changes in your current relationship and plans, right, that -- you're steady as you go with PayPal, I imagine, right?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think you'd be jumping to a conclusion that they're going to separate in the first place. I mean, certainly, we're seeing a lot more well-run, large companies with activists in the stocks. And so I personally would be really surprised if we saw a change there.","Operator","Bob Napoli from William Blair is online with a question.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just like to get some insight on your thoughts about the economy, David, where you -- your view on whether the economy in the U.S. is getting a little bit better or stable from your view?","David W. Nelms","I'd say the numbers I'm seeing at the moment suggest stability. I think that we have the potential to accelerate, and we need to get past this debt limit without self-inflicting wounds to ourselves. And -- but if I look at a whole number of things, the less fiscal constraint, as we saw last year with tax increases and reduced spending, that certainly reduced GDP growth. That shouldn't occur nearly as much this year. So that's helpful. The unemployment rate continues to tick down. We've seen some -- mostly better numbers coming out. I don't think it's really translated into sales growth that's sustained. And we went through 3 years of feeling better in the first quarter and then things deteriorated. I'm hopeful that this year, they'll actually maintain or even get better through the year. So I'm hopeful, but I don't really have -- we need a couple of data points of GDP growth and unemployment that keep going in the right direction before we can, I think, declare a strong upward trend.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Then on the growth side, I mean, you talked about hoping to get a little bit of a pickup in the card loan growth, the personal loans, still very strong growth. Now the student loan market seems to have slowed a little bit. Looking at your growth this quarter, Sallie Mae's growth, I mean, I think there is good news in that maybe college prices are going up a little less than they have been in prior years but maybe there are less people going into colleges. I'm just wondering what you felt like on the outlook for loan growth on the student loan side. And then how quickly will the home equity loan become material to you? Is this a material product in '14 or are we looking a few more years down the road?","David W. Nelms","Well, I guess I would be hopeful that we could achieve a little bit higher loan growth this year than last on private student loans ourselves, because last year, we had the headwind of going from 2 brands to 1, which we overcame. But this year, we don't have that same headwind. But we're not looking for anything quite dramatic. As you mentioned, tuition costs finally seemed to at least slowed down their increase. And I think that is a good thing. And -- but that impacts the size of the market. In terms of the personal loans, I think that I'm thinking about...","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Home equity.","David W. Nelms","I'm sorry, home equity. In terms of home equity, I think that this is our first year, and I think just like when we entered student loans and personal loans, our first year was pretty modest in terms of easing into a new business. So I think we'll err on the side of being cautious year 1. And then I think in subsequent years, we would hope to accelerate it as we have more testing under our belts and understand, in particular, what marketing sales work better versus less well, what is the best marketing pitch, our operations are all -- are starting to scale up. And so I would think modestly about this first year.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","If I could sneak this in. On the capital side, you've grown capital this year even while aggressively buying back stock. And I mean the Fed, I mean, through the CCAR, it doesn't seem like they'll let you buy back more capital than what you generate in a current year. Are there any thoughts on more, maybe looking at acquisitions? I mean, it's a great problem to have. And where your stock is, it's very accretive buying back that stock, but what are your thoughts? I mean, you don't want to continue to see the capital level build, I'm sure.","David W. Nelms","Yes. I would -- we've noticed that as well. We're doing what we can to be good stewards of our shareholders' capital. But I guess it's a nice problem to have that we're so profitable that we still built book value, I think, 15% this year, despite buying back and having dividends of about $1.5 billion. We will -- I think there's the potential because we submit the capital request on a dollar basis, not a percentage basis, and we really can't adjust easily. We would be a lot closer to paying out our full earnings in a year if we didn't exceed our earnings by so much. Now I don't know which one you'd rather have. Probably exceeding earnings and accreting capital is probably the better problem to have, but it does result in putting pressure on our ROE. The fact that we got a 22%, achieved a 22% ROE. Even with the higher capital, though, I think you should feel good about this quarter.","Operator","Eric Wasserstrom from SunTrust Robinson is online with a question.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. The first is, I'd be interested to understand, in your process of going through the CCAR exam for the first time, what you thought the most meaningful differences were from your former CapPR experience?","R. Mark Graf","Sure. I would say the cases we look at and the stresses we're required to run, I would say, are essentially the same. The big difference between the CapPR and the CCAR is we have to ship a significant amount of raw data to the Fed, measured as in hundreds of billions of dollars, billions with a B, hundreds of billions of fields of data actually gets shipped to them so that they can run their own models on us and come up with the independent perspective there. So I would say the differences are really more in terms of, in a CapPR process, they come in and pressure-test your submission, your models and your stresses. In the CCAR process, they do all of that, but then they also come in on top and run their own models. And I think our first year through it, the most telling thing will come out in a couple of months when we get a sense for how their models view the loss rates that our data produced under a stress scenario. So what I would say is hold that question to the next quarter's Q&A and we'll be able to give you a pretty clear perspective on the deltas between how we're looking at our loss picks and how the Fed is.","David W. Nelms","The other thing that I would add is just the process itself is even more rigorous with more board involvement and more validation of models and so on. And so not so much the bearing of the cases, but the strength of the process, which we have made major investments on and have dramatically enhanced this year versus last year.","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I think one of the things I've said in a couple of settings is that we've not been shy about spending money to make sure we're ready for the CCAR process this year. It is our first year. We were lucky we acknowledged that, and for us not to bring in external resources who've helped others through this process in the past, and have the benefit of those learnings, I think, would have been shortsighted. And we've not been shy about making sure we've invested to be prepared.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then if I could just sneak in a couple of follow-ups. What should we think about in terms of your go-forward tax rate from here?","R. Mark Graf","I'd think about it as 37% to 38% range is the right approach.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the other income that was up sequentially, I was surprised at that, given your continued decline in mortgage origination. What accounted for that small sequential uptick?","Bill Franklin","Are you referring to the $3 million in other, other income?","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, correct.","Bill Franklin","I think it was a bunch of cats and dogs.","R. Mark Graf","It is cats and dogs.","Bill Franklin","I don't have the detail in front of me.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, it is cats and dogs is the answer to the question. There's nothing specific to call out in there.","Operator","Daniel Furtado from Jefferies is online with a question.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I have one question, and I don't know if you'll be able to answer it or not, but how meaningful do you anticipate the rewards checking product to be for your funding base? And what type of impacts, broadly speaking, would you anticipate this product to have on your funding costs?","David W. Nelms","Well, Danny, I would think about it as not being meaningful in the short term. In the long term, we certainly expect it to be meaningful. I'm really excited about it because it is uniquely valuable to consumers having cashback bonus, no fee, no monthly fees and a very feature-rich product. And so far, we've only sold it through cross-sell this year. We are on track for launching a broad market. So the good news is it's a great product. And the bad news is that it's a very sticky product. And so we think it's going to take a long time to get people aware of the savings that they can have from this product, as well as to wean them from what they're used to, which is the bank down the street. And so I think we have modest growth plans in the near term as we launch this, because it is new and different.","Operator","Brian Foran from Autonomous is online with a question.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess [indiscernible]","Bill Franklin","Brian, your phone's breaking up. Can you speak louder?","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I'm sorry about that. At the Investor Day last year, you had laid out the 6 strategic initiatives, and you've touched on most of them. I was wondering, maybe just to clean up, if you can remind us where the core banking system replacement or upgrade stands. And then more broadly, the it card clearly has been a big success. The mortgage business, notwithstanding the recent refi slowdown, has been a success. When you touched on home equity, when you think about the other 4 you had laid out, clearly, there have been some headwinds. And I wonder, of those other 4, the deposit, the checking, the PayPal, et cetera, is it just a delay in the ultimate opportunity or is there anywhere where you've kind of downgraded your internal thinking on what the opportunity actually is?","David W. Nelms","Sure. Well, I don't want to go through all those because we'll have to cancel our Investor Day, because as you know, we always do a report card on how we did and then talk about our priorities for the coming year. But I'd say generally, the ones that we had hoped to launch but didn't are all delayed as opposed to -- I don't think any of them have sort of been canceled. And so you started off by asking about the core banking system. We had originally hoped to get that live at the end of last year. And that's moved into this year, but we are on track for putting it in. But obviously, it's more important, a lot more important to put a system in right with low risk as opposed to getting it in fast. And I think that's true with some of the other priorities. And many of them, we nailed during the year, and some others have slipped from '13 into '14.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","And then just circling back to the acquisitions question. I mean, clearly, you guys have always been very low risk, very conservative and thoughtful over time doing acquisitions. But I wonder, specifically on the topic of portfolio acquisitions, if there's anything floating around out there that is worth looking at and interesting to you at this point?","David W. Nelms","You mentioned portfolio acquisitions, and that's not really -- I think if you look at what we've done, it's been more business acquisitions, if you think about student loans or mortgages or even PULSE and Diners Club over the years. And we continue to look at potential acquisitions, but I just wouldn't count on anything because, as you say, we're cautious. It is a lot more difficult making acquisitions with the sort of regulatory environment. And we want to make sure that we don't buy something that then has problems or what have you. So we're -- maybe in this current environment, we're even more cautious than we normally are. But that being said, if it's the right fit, the right financials and unique for us, we would love to put some of our capital to work.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

My name is Hilda, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem. Mr. Streem, you may begin.","Craig A. Streem","Today, Hilda. And welcome, everyone, to this afternoon's call. We certainly appreciate your joining us for the discussion today. Let me begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011, which is on file with the SEC. ","In the first quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. And we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. ","Finally, we will be holding our annual financial community update tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. at The New York Palace Hotel. If you would like more information about that meeting, please get in touch with me these evening by e-mail. And with that event ahead of us tomorrow, it is our intention to keep this call and your questions focused on our first quarter results and performance, and we'll certainly have much more for you tomorrow regarding our strategies for profitable growth. ","Our call this afternoon will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. And of course, a question-and-answer session, excuse me. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As Craig mentioned, we are looking forward to our annual financial community briefing tomorrow morning where members of our executive team will take you through some of the exciting developments and opportunities ahead of us at Discover. ","After the market closed today, we reported record first quarter net income of $631 million, or $1.18 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit performance, along with solid organic growth in receivables and strong volume growth across all of our networks. In Direct Banking, we continued to deliver good growth in card, private student and personal loans and achieved record profits in our Payment Services business and are continuing to expand our network. ","I'm very pleased with our 9% year-over-year loan growth, which reflects $1.6 billion in card loan growth. And in private student and personal loans, we eclipsed $10 billion in receivables. In terms of credit card performance, we achieved 25-year lows for net charge-off rate and 30-plus delinquency rate, demonstrating the quality of our portfolio and the strength of our risk management capabilities. ","Before I turn the call over to Mark for some more detail in the financial results, I want to mention some recent developments that augur well for future growth and for continued generation of solid shareholder returns. The first of these was our receipt of the non-objection from the Fed related to our capital plan and proposed capital actions. In connection with that, we announced a new 2-year share repurchase authorization of $2 billion along with our regular quarterly dividend. I do want to remind you that last quarter, we took up the dividend by 67% to its current quarterly level of $0.10 per share, and we will review the dividend level at least on an annual basis. ","A second recent development for us on the business side was our announcement of a new long-term agreement with the National Payments Corporation of India, which runs the RuPay network in India. Since its founding in 2009 by a consortium of Indian banks, NPCI has grown its share of ATM process transactions in India to 95%. Our new agreement will enable acceptance of Discover and Diners Club International cards at NPCI's ATMs and, eventually, point-of-sale terminals throughout India. The agreement will also allow RuPay cardholders to utilize the Discover, Diners Club International and PULSE networks for purchases and cash access outside of India. We expect this arrangement will result in increased transaction volume over time. I am very pleased that NPCI recognized Discover as the most flexible network and best partner for the future in one of the fastest-growing, largest potential customer, or countries for payment cards. At our meeting tomorrow, Diane Offereins will have more to say about our global network strategy. ","The other very recent announcement that I want to highlight relates to the launch of the first Discover-branded card in the international marketplace by our Diners Club franchise partner in Ecuador. This is an important strategic development because we believe it will allow us to market-test a model that could eventually become a framework for expanding Discover-branded card issuance into additional countries with what to date has been a purely domestic model. ","One final recent announcement was earlier today, we announced a new deal with the large network in Puerto Rico, and we're excited to tell you more about that tomorrow as well. ","We look forward to meeting with you tomorrow where we will share our model for long-term, profitable growth and the initiatives that will help us to achieve our goals for 2012 and beyond. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Mark Graf to review our first quarter results.","R. Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's first quarter results. The segment earned $962 million pretax this quarter versus $677 million last year. Reserve releases contributed $226 million to pretax earnings in the quarter as credit continued to improve to a greater degree than we had expected last quarter. ","Turning to yield on the card portfolio. We reported a 44-basis-point decrease from the prior year to 12.21%. This happened as our higher-priced balances declined and our promotional volumes increased. These were partially offset by lower interest charge-offs. We are now including total interest and fee charge-offs in the financial supplement, so you don't have to wait for the 10-Q for that disclosure. ","Total portfolio yield was 11.36%, lower by 74 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year driven primarily by the acquisition of the private student loan portfolios in the first and fourth quarters of last year, as well as the card yield compression I just mentioned. The yield compression was slightly offset by the effect of the sale of federal student loans last month. ","Net interest income increased $123 million, or 11%, versus the prior year driven by asset growth, lower charge-offs of accrued interest and the benefit of lower interest expense. Net interest margin on receivables was 9.03%, down 19 basis points compared to the prior year due to the yield compression I mentioned a moment ago, partially offset by funding cost improvement. ","The modest sequential decrease in net interest margin of 7 basis points was primarily driven by having a full quarter of net interest income from the $2.4 billion in private student loans that we acquired during the fourth quarter, along with the corresponding sequential card yield compression. Again, funding cost improvement partially offset this NIM compression. Absent any inorganic asset mix shifts, we expect the net interest margin to stabilize around this level for the remainder of the year as funding cost improvement largely offsets both card yield compression and organic growth in private student loans. However, it's important to note that we also expect student loans to produce much lower average credit losses than we expect to see in the card product. ","Other income for the Direct Banking segment decreased $22 million from last year's first quarter due in large part to a $16 million bargain purchase gain related to the SLC acquisition in the prior year period, as well as slightly lower protection product revenues. Higher discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by higher rewards as we increased our rewards rate on card sales to 92 basis points from 86 basis points in the first quarter of last year. ","Total operating expenses for the segment were up $82 million over the prior year. Expenses were up to support completed acquisitions, the higher level of loans and higher legal reserves. The increase in expenses for this quarter reflects investments to further our diversification in Direct Banking, and we expect to benefit from these investments as we move further into 2012. Going forward, we'll continue to be diligent on expense management, and we'll provide more perspective on our thoughts around operating expenses during our Investor Day tomorrow. ","Now I'll switch to lending product growth and credit performance for the segment. We achieved card sales growth of 7% for the first quarter versus the prior year. The growth in card sales was driven by our continued focus on increasing our merchant acceptance, enriching our rewards programs and leveraging our marketing investments. Our total loan portfolio grew $4.6 billion with $2.4 billion of this growth attributable to the second accretive private student loan acquisition. Receivables in our personal loan product were up $764 million from the prior year, while our credit card loans were up $1.6 billion. The sale of our remaining federal student loan portfolio was completed this quarter and is already reflected in the numbers I just provided. ","Turning to card credit quality. Our positive momentum continued this quarter as the card net charge-off rate and 30-plus delinquency rate each declined 17 basis points sequentially. The card reserve rate decreased 44 basis points as well, reflecting a brighter forward 12-month outlook for credit performance, which resulted in a $235 million card reserve release. Going forward, we still expect to build reserves at some point in the next 12 months as our loan portfolio continues to grow. However, the underlying economic environment clearly seems to be more constructive at this juncture. ","For our private student loan portfolio, the net principal charge-off rate, excluding our purchased portfolios, was 49 basis points. The charge-offs and delinquencies in our private student loan portfolio were performing according to our expectations. ","In terms of personal loan credit performance, loans greater than 30 days past due fell 6 basis points sequentially, and the personal loan net principal charge-off rate was essentially flat at 2.59%. ","On the payment side, we had another quarter of record pretax earnings and payment volumes. Pretax income was up $9 million, or 21%, from the prior year to $52 million, driven by higher-margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE PIN debit network business. Volumes were up 8% against the prior year, driven by 9% growth in PULSE debit volumes and 15% growth in our third-party issuing volumes. The increase in third-party issuing volume was driven mostly by spend on Walmart and Sam's Club Cards and higher prepaid volume. ","Let's move on to liquidity, funding and capital. Our liquidity levels were strong to end the quarter with total actual and contingent liquidity of $28 billion. Our liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $12.1 billion, up $1.9 billion from the prior year as we opportunistically pre-funded upcoming maturities, including by issuing a $1 billion, 3-year ABS deal prior to the quarter's close at a fixed rate of 81 basis points. ","Direct-to-consumer deposits are once again our largest source of funding at 46%. Our funding cost is continuing to fall as we replace higher-cost deposits that we originated in a much higher rate environment. I'll take you through our expected quarterly maturities for 2012 and 2013 in my presentation tomorrow. As we've said before, we continue to remain opportunistic across all our funding channels by tapping all but not exhausting any of them. ","Turning to capital. For some time now, we have benchmarked our key capital ratio as tangible common equity-to-tangible assets with a target of plus or minus 8%. Going forward, we will switch to focusing on our Tier 1 common capital ratio as it better represents how regulators and the industry look at capital levels, and we have established a 9.5% long-term target. We ended the most recent quarter at 14.3%. We'll address both this new target and our approach to excess capital in more detail tomorrow. ","The strength of our capital position allowed us to announce the new $2 billion share repurchase authorization last week after completing the capital review process with our regulators. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders via a mix of share repurchases and dividends as well as opportunistic acquisitions at the right price. ","That concludes our formal remarks, so I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We received a question from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on revenues and capital management. Just first on revenues, I was hoping you could just talk, Mark, about your card yield expectations embedded in the net interest margin expectations for the remainder of the year. And then secondly, on the third-party payments segment, it seems like the pretax margin has been expanding at a pretty rapid rate. Could you just talk about what's happening there? And then just on excess capital, I don't want to front-run your comments tomorrow but maybe you can just talk about how you intend to utilize the share repurchase program, especially in the context of kind of what you guys did in the first quarter.","David W. Nelms","Sure. Absolutely, Sanjay. There was a lot in there. I'll try and touch on all of them. Please feel free to catch me if I don't touch all of them. With respect to expectations for card yield, I think we -- we'll be providing some greater detail on that thought during our Investor Day tomorrow, so I don't want to jump the gun too much. But what I would say is we continue to expect to see some continued compression coming primarily from the attrition of some of those higher-rate balances that predate CARD Act. That is continuing at this point in time. But we expect the compression resulting from that, as well as our other activities, to essentially be offset by the funding cost tailwind we've got right now. Actually, on a card yield loan basis, it'll more than offset it, I think. So it's -- that's the right way to think about it, range it in. Again, a little bit more detail tomorrow. And then with respect to the share repurchase thoughts, we are going to give some guidance around our expectations and cadence in terms of how we'll be looking at that going forward during the Investor Day tomorrow as well. So I would encourage you to stay tuned because we'll give you some pretty specific thoughts there.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And just the third-party payment segment and the pretax operating margin there?","David W. Nelms","I'd say we are -- continue to focus on higher-margin business and also get some benefits of scale given the fixed cost as we grow that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess a question on the reserve. I guess you released more than most of us had been expecting. And Mark, I think you highlighted a brighter outlook, but you said that you will be building as reserves grow. So I guess I'm just trying to understand the takeaway message in that. Are you saying that the build is going -- is solely going to be a function of the fact that loans grow? So can we assume that if -- assuming your outlook holds, that if re -- if loan balances stay flat, that the reserve would stay flat?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, our current outlook would lead us to conclude that we don't expect to see a turn in credit performance in the forward 12-month period of time. So yes, Ryan, you're correctly reading what we're saying in that we expect any reserve build going forward to be directly related to growth in the loan book itself.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just another question. I think if you look at your loan balances, I guess, quarter-over-quarter, they were down about 1.5%. If you look in the industry, I think they're down sizeably more. Can you just give a sense of, one, where you think you're taking market share from? And do you think it's the fact that your portfolio is outperforming is just more a function of some people just have more seasonality in their books? Or you actually think there is some market share benefit happening there?","David W. Nelms","Well, Ryan, I would say that we tend to look at it year-over-year to remove the seasonality of that, and we have been outperforming for quite some period of time. Part -- I think I'd start with lower charge-off rates. We're not losing off the top. And we also believe we have higher customer retention of longtime balances. So that really helped. And then obviously, we are very focused on acceptance, as well as our cash rewards program and enhanced marketing. So there's no one piece, but it all adds up to us growing and many of our competitors working to try to get back to 0.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stifel Consulting.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an update on the success you've had in your PULSE segment, of adding additional issuers around the Dodd-Frank requirement around the exclusivity that starts on April 1? Any meaningful progress there?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think that -- you'll recall that this is a 2-step process. We have to first sign the issuers and then there's new routing rules that go in place in April. PULSE recently announced that we signed 129 issuers last year, which we feel good about, and so we feel good about where we stand on that first step. But I think that there are a lot of -- there's a lot of changes going on in the industry right now, so we're going to have to monitor that carefully over the coming months, too.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a second question would be just can you give us an update, David, on credit card loan demand? What you're seeing on the frontlines from your consumers? And we seeing good spending volume and loan growth for Discover this quarter is a little bit ahead of our expectations. But I think you've been dealing [ph] pretty cautious on the outlook for loan growth. Any change to that over the last 3 months? And any commentary on uptake of Tier 3 [ph] offers would be helpful.","David W. Nelms","I wouldn't say that I've seen any dramatic change in trend over the last quarter. We continue to see sales growing obviously faster than loans. But consumers are continuing to expand spending, but they've kind of finished their deleveraging process, and I don't see them certainly expanding dramatically their debt at a greater pace. So I think it's a slow, steady increase. I personally expect the industry to eventually return to growth at about GDP growth, and I think that's going to be more driven by sales than by future rates or balance transfers, which was the other part of your question. I haven't seen a big change on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Can you give us some color in terms of what you saw in the way of -- any changes in spending during the quarter? And I guess I wasn't clear on how much of the spending growth was attributable to new cards and -- and then new cards in the quarter and new cards over the last year. And then did the changes in gasoline prices have much of an effect on overall spending growth this quarter?","David W. Nelms","Well, you saw our spend growth year-over-year will be pretty stable this last quarter as well as the quarter before. I don't -- a lot of this increase in gas prices really happened towards the end of the quarter, so I wouldn't say there was anything that really -- I don't think that was a huge driver. And frankly, I -- during the quarter, we saw a lot of continuation of the trend that I've seen and that we've seen in previous 2 quarters with gradual improvement across multiple spending categories.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So existing cardholders spending at -- growing spending about the same rate as the average for the portfolio?","David W. Nelms","Yes. A good amount of -- probably the majority of this -- of our spend increase tends to be from existing customers. We are putting on new customers at a somewhat higher rate, but I wouldn't say dramatically so. So I think we're seeing a pretty balanced improvement across categories, across current and new customers, and obviously, still focused more on the better-credit-quality, higher-FICO-score customers, if you will. I mean, that's one place I will see a little more robustness.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then, sorry, could you just remind us how much you had in soft loans that you sold during the quarter? And was there any gain on that sale?","R. Mark Graf","No, there was no gain on that. And the remaining portion in the held-for-sale was around $700 million.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So you sold the whole -- that $720 million, whatever it was that...","R. Mark Graf","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays Capital.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, I know you addressed some of these at a high level, some of the expense items. But is there anything specifically you can point to on the other expense line and the employee comp that causes it to be up meaningfully?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I wouldn't say -- if you look at the other, other expense line, Mark, there's a number of different pieces moving around in there. One is clearly year-over-year. You have the full integration of the Student Loan or the continued integration of student loan business and significant increased expenses related to that, as well as some increases related to some of the new business initiatives that we'll be talking about pretty extensively at our Investor Day tomorrow. The other thing, obviously, that shows up in other, other is the litigation reserve. And I would say it's -- that a meaningful portion of the year-over-year increase in that other, other piece is due to reserves related to litigation and regulatory matters. And I'd point you back to our 10-K disclosures on that one. There's a number of litigation matters we're involved in currently and, by policy, we don't tend to talk about them specifically. So I can't really provide any further color. But that's kind of where I take it.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then rewards picked up a little bit as a percentage of interchange revenue, discount revenue. Is -- does this represent kind of a new run rate? Are you still seeing a little bit of upward inflation in rewards expense?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think as we look at the reward expense line item we guided last quarter, we thought it will be somewhat higher this quarter. Indeed it was. I think as we look at where we are right now for the remainder of the year, we think we'll be somewhere in this general range. We've got the ability to be slightly higher possibly, but somewhere around the range where we are right now feels about right to us.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And can you give us an update on kind of where you stand as far as the mix of promotional balances versus standard and your default pricing bucket?","R. Mark Graf","Harit is going to be speaking about that directly in his section during the Investor Day tomorrow, so I don't want to steal his thunder.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Stilmar from SunTrust.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions, the first of which, and maybe this is also for tomorrow, I was wondering if you might be able to touch a little bit more about your really impressive move with regards to recoveries and that you still continue to show growth in recovery dollars despite your continued cautiousness here. I'm wondering if you can kind of give us a little -- some color as to what pockets you're seeing and -- because it certainly define the lag conditions relative to previous charge-offs that we had certainly talked about. And then my second question is, where is pricing today in private student loans? I was wondering if you could just give us the average private student loans that were originated this quarter. Well, I'm just trying to get a sense for where we are in terms of the pricing environment.","David W. Nelms","Well, I'll handle the first one. I don't -- I'm sorry, why don't you do the second one?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, go ahead, please.","David W. Nelms","Well, repeat the first -- the first question was?","Craig A. Streem","Recoveries.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Recoveries.","David W. Nelms","Recoveries. I'm sorry. Sorry, I was thinking about your second one. A big part of it is just our recovery. Our total inventory of the charge-off dollars is still very significant from the last few years. And I think that as some people go back to work or have a desire to repay some of the loans, I think we've been pleasantly surprised by some of that debt over the last few years that is at least partially repaid. I wouldn't point you to any specific pocket or strategy. Maybe Jim will be able to shed a little more light on it tomorrow. But I will say the big factor is just large inventories on which we're parking. Mark, on the second one.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, in terms of the yield on the student loan Portfolio, I'd say it came down about 105 basis points year-over-year. That was principally due to the addition of the $2.5 billion in private student loans that we closed on September 30. They came on at a much lower yield, but also a much lower loss expectation than we had in the first acquisition. So that had some impact there. And I would say sequentially, the yield decreased about 46 basis points because you only have the impact of that $2.5 billion acquisition in parts of last -- the last quarter. And so it fully kicked in. You had the full impact of it this quarter.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I was just curious in terms of new loans that you've originated in the quarter that may not have shown up, like just the absolute coupon that you put on the books this past quarter. I was wondering if you have that available.","R. Mark Graf","I don't have it at my fingertips, but we'll be happy to address it tomorrow for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Mark, in light of the multi-decade lows you're seeing in credit quality metrics, can you comment on where new card volumes might fit in with the current metrics as they season what your expectations are?","R. Mark Graf","David, do you want to take the first stab at that and I'll follow on?","David W. Nelms","I would say that the larger improvements on credit quality have probably come from more of the base. And we've seen maybe less dramatic of an improvement on the newest vintages originated in the last few years. But we are still seeing some improvements even on those new vintages. And it's probably partly related on us refining our models and maybe partly environmentally, things are starting to improve a bit more.","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I mean, as we look -- as I indicated earlier, as we look at our 12-month forward loss forecast, we continue to be surprised, as the quarter rolls up and a new quarter rolls on, at the fact just the performance continues to look very, very solid going forward. With respect to specifically where we think credit trends look over the course of the cycle, if you will, as opposed to spot at this point in time, Jim Panzarino is going to provide some pretty significant detail around that at our Investor Day tomorrow. I think it's fair to say that -- that it's -- we view it as likely good news, not bad news. Let's put it that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess maybe just trying to follow up on that question on normalized credit losses, if you will. And I -- where -- more tomorrow. I don't want to go too far. But the -- I mean, your return on equity is obviously way above your goals, even after you adjust for reserves. The industry is generating substantial excess capital above normalized levels, I think, now. I mean, don't you expect that credit losses would kind of normalize back at historical -- I mean, would 5% be kind of around where you would expect normalized credit losses to be through a cycle?","David W. Nelms","Yes, Bobby, I think it's a good question and a difficult one to answer because I think we're in new territory at this point. We used to say 5% to 6% losses in credit cards over the cycle, and I think that there's been enough structural changes in the industry between deleveraging, consolidated industry. You just don't have all the sub-prime players out there that used to have an impact on everyone. Even the CARD Act had a certain impact on it. And so -- and I think even consumer behavior has actually taken a shift after coming through this cycle. Consumers are more cautious, and that will show up in lower losses over time. So if I had to guess, I would say eventually we're going to see more like 4% to 5% being kind of a range of normalization. And I think it's going to maybe take longer than we might have expected to get there. Mark originally -- earlier today, he said, \"Look, over the next 12 months, we're not going to -- we're not really seeing any signs.\" I mean, we're seeing signs of maybe approaching a bottom, but you saw both our delinquencies and charge-off rates this quarter still improve.\" So it indicates we're not quite at the bottom yet, but we should be getting close. And so -- but I wouldn't see anything that would dramatically take it up, and I would say it's probably going to be a while before we -- if it's going to go back to 4% or 5%, it's going to be a while, we think.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. The share repurchase approval, the extension, I mean, how -- I mean, you have a lot of capital. How aggressive are you going to be on buying back shares? Or, I mean, are you looking at acquisitions that would make you a little more cautious on the rate of share repurchase?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, what I would say is we're going to go into that in some detail tomorrow. So I'm unfortunately going to hold my comments on that one and make you wait 12 hours or so for that one. But I think it's fair to say we intend to be very disciplined overall.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And last question. The federal loans you sold, who did you sell them to? And was there a gain on the sale in the quarter?","R. Mark Graf","I'm not sure we've disclosed to the results, and I don't know legally if the contract allows us to. So I won't go there. But I know there was no gain nor loss of any significance on the sale of those loans.","Operator","The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Kind of along the lines of the -- a prior question about normalized credit losses, any thoughts about kind of going either a little deeper or changing credit criteria to push balance growth faster? Is this anything -- is that something that's thought about? Or how do you discuss that?","David W. Nelms","It'll -- what I would say is that if we can find expansion areas where we can still get prime credit performance, we would certainly seek to expand our criteria in those areas. I think we don't have the appetite to kind of go sub-prime, if you will. But certainly, some of the changes we're seeing suggest that there may be -- may indeed be some sales where we could approve someone that will -- in fact our -- that prime credit performance that we're looking for. But we're -- as you know from our reputation and results, we're going to be cautious on this.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Ball from Evercore.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about your experience in terms of organic private student loan growth and what your outlook is for private student loan growth and also personal loan growth?","David W. Nelms","I think last year, we said that we were targeting $1 billion-plus of organic growth, and I'd say we're on track to achieve that.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","On track for $1 billion annually?","David W. Nelms","Well, we said for this year. But certainly, what I would expect is that this business, we may be able to ramp up by even a little bit more over time. But we do think it's $1 billion-plus kind of a year business for us -- growth.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I wonder if you can comment. Senator Durbin has been holding hearings to discuss removing the non-dischargeability of private student loans. Well, if that were to go through, what kind of impact would that have on your business?","David W. Nelms","Well, just one thing quickly. And I don't know, you may have asked student and personal loans before, and the $1 billion-plus is just personal -- just student loans, and then personal loans will be something greater than that. In terms of the dischargeability in bankruptcy, it -- there's not -- I don't expect anything to happen real quickly, if at all, in this area. But if it did, it would depend on exactly how. Is it immediately dischargeable? So when someone graduates and they haven't even had time to start making money, they could walk away? Or would it be after 5 years they could be dischargeable? So I think the precise way it happened would matter. But I'd also say we have relatively low losses in this. So it -- I don't think -- I think it will certainly change how we think about pricing going forward, but I don't think it would totally undermine the business model. Certainly, the fact that most of our loans are cosigned, I think, gives us some protection from anything too dramatic.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one separate question. What proportion of your balances, your card balances, are currently on promotional rates?","R. Mark Graf","That will be disclosed by Harit tomorrow. It's a big part of his presentation. We don't want to steal his thunder.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Furtado from Jefferies & Company.","Martin Kemnec - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Martin Kemnec in for Dan Furtado. I also have a question on recovery levels. So building off of John's earlier question. I mean, you guys have obviously continued to recapture your previous losses at a pretty impressive rate. I guess what I'm try to focus on, is there some type of a limitation on how far the look-back is there on that? I mean, generally speaking, after an account is charged off, what type of timeframe are we looking at for recovery? I mean, obviously, there's legal statutes around that. But if you have any guidance, that'd be helpful?","David W. Nelms","Recoveries is a very broad focus. And so for -- and one of the reasons that we tend to have high -- our recoveries have held up is that unlike many of our competitors, we haven't sold things. And so within recoveries, for instance, are people who went through Chapter 13 bankruptcy and signed up for a prepayment plan. And then that's somewhat of an annuity that lasts for many years after that. Many of our competitors sold that off in past years, especially as losses peaked. We didn't sell any. And so you get a whole variety of these, and some of these could be loans from quite some time ago that have been on a regular repayment plan but are counted as recoveries because we wrote them off. It could be 5 years-plus ago.","R. Mark Graf","We've actually also been investing very heavily in that area. We've got some what we think are some unique techniques we're utilizing on the collection side. Some of the expense growth you've seen happened toward that part of that business, and we think it's a vindication and validation of that paying off.","Martin Kemnec - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Excellent, excellent. And then building off of Mark's question on rewards expense, thanks for the guidance on where you guys see that. I mean, stepping back more broadly, are you guys still seeing competition act rationally with respect to rewards offerings? Or how do you guys kind of frame that up?","David W. Nelms","I think it's a tough one to answer. There's -- we do think that some of our competitors are probably, in our view, spending reward dollars at unsustainably high levels. And -- but they're -- if you look back over time, the history, is that people have tended to put up reward programs, find out that they're kind of expensive and then back off and devalue. And a number of competitors have done that. Our approach has been to have a sustainable program that gives great value to consumers, and -- but is still -- is also affordable by us.","Operator","We also have Matthew Howlett from Macquarie.","Matthew Howlett - Macquarie Research","Just on the creation of the CFPV, any more -- I know it's in development. But any more clarity of what you'd expect out of that department, if anything?","David W. Nelms","Well, I think, I mean, it's been operational since summer's -- last summer, so I wouldn't say it's totally in development. But I -- it also is continuing to gain experience, and we're continuing to gain experience with the CFPV [ph]. And all I could say is that we look to have a very constructive dialogue. And our understanding is that they want to factually based. And if that's how things proceed, we think we've got good facts. So we'll just have constructive dialogue with them.","Matthew Howlett - Macquarie Research","I mean, as it stands now, do you see any major impact on, first of all, marketing or even pricing? And since -- I mean, are they -- do you foresee potentially them coming in and so asking to -- kind of adjustings [ph] on those 2 topics or anything else that could really affect the business model?","David W. Nelms","I just wouldn't want to speculate.","Matthew Howlett - Macquarie Research","Got you, okay. And then just on the student loans, I mean, great performance so far. Anything that you're seeing on the repayment when the loans hit the repayment side? I mean, anything out of the ordinary in terms of defaults? Or is that just sort of coming in, in line?","David W. Nelms","I'd say that the repayments and delinquencies and charge-offs are pretty in line with our expectations.","Operator","That was our last question. I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing remarks.","David W. Nelms","Thanks, Hilda. I just want to thank all of you for your questions and your attention this evening, and we are really excited about tomorrow morning's meeting and look forward to either seeing all of you in person or, if not, then certainly on the webcast. So thanks, and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participating.

My name is Leslie and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bill Franklin. Mr. Franklin, you may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Leslie. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin as always with slide 2 of our earnings presentation which is on the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the fourth quarter 2014 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call this afternoon will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David Nelms","Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Starting on slide 3 of the earnings presentation, we reported fourth quarter net income of $404 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.87 after some one-time charges in the quarter. Excluding these charges, adjusted net income was $553 million or $1.19 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.","Mark will cover the details of the charges later, but the largest was the previously announced $178 million elimination of our credit card Rewards forfeiture reserve. We think the changes that we decided to make in our rewards program that resulted in this charge will be beneficial to our business and we are receiving favorable feedback from our card members. Our business model continues to deliver solid results.","Turning to slide 4, Discover achieved total loan growth of 6% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in card and personal loans. Card receivables grew 6% this quarter. This growth is the result of the continuing success of Discover it driving new accounts and increasing wallet share with existing customers. Our focus on the prime revolver segment is working as evidenced by relative yield stability and profitable loan growth.","Card sales for the quarter increased 5% from the prior year. Lower gas prices brought down the sales growth by roughly 1%. Private student loans grew 4% and when you look at the organic growth excluding the acquired portfolios, we achieved 22% growth year-over-year. Personal loans surpassed $5 billion in receivables, up 19% from the prior year.","On the right side of slide 4, payments volume in total was up 2%. PULSE volume increased 4% from the prior year. Network Partners volume declined 13% due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party issuer. This runoff in Network Partners volume was partially offset by growing AribaPay volume, however, this volume is at a substantially lower margin. Diners volume increased 2%, but was up high single digits year-over-year on a real basis excluding FX. This was driven by strong volume growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.","Turning to slide 5, as we look back on 2014, our first priority was to grow Discover card loan share while maintaining leading credit performance. We grew card receivables by 6%, a pace that was meaningfully faster than the industry. The new accounts we originated are more active which speaks to the features and benefits of Discover it.","We have made investments in customer experience and rewards and across all channels a card member may choose to access their account whether it is on a desktop, a tablet or a mobile phone. In 2014, Discover received the highest rating in the area of customer interaction and tied for highest total customer satisfaction with credit card companies according to J.D. Power. In addition, we launched a new rewards site, Discover Deals which provides card members with valuable offers and provides retailers with a low-cost, highly targeted marketing platform. I'm also very proud that our 2.3% card net charge-off rate is one of the lowest in the industry.","We grew our non-card loans by originating $1.2 billion of private student loans and almost $3 billion of personal loans. Private student and personal loans combined drove non-card receivables growth of approximately 10%, at the top end of our long-term target of 5% to 10%. In payments, we lost some third-party volume and Network Partners and the competitive landscape in debit remains challenging. However, our global acceptance and reach of the Discover network is larger than it has ever been.","Also, the Discover network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business. In emerging payments, we are very pleased with the early results at the launch of AribaPay which generated $1.5 billion in volume in the fourth quarter. In terms of progress against optimizing our funding costs, we have continued to extend the duration of our funding by issuing longer term fixed rate debt and we took actions which we believe will make our deposits stickier when rates rise. In regards to optimizing our capital position, we repurchased 5% of our shares while also increasing our dividend.","Lastly, we continue to enhance our operating model with our successful implementation of the deposit component of our core banking platform. Additionally, we continue to strengthen our compliance and controls infrastructure which will remain a focus in 2015. We will discuss our other 2015 priorities later this year at our financial community briefing but one preview I'll give you is that we plan on launching a new card product early this year.","As we look back on 2014, we feel very good about how we executed on these priorities. We delivered net income for the year of $2.3 billion or $2.5 billion adjusted for the non-recurring charges in the fourth quarter and we achieved an ROE of over 20%.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results.","Mark Graf","Thanks, David. Good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on slide 6 of our presentation. Net interest income increased $103 million or 7% over the prior-year, due to continued strong loan growth. Total non-interest income was down $195 million due largely to the previously announced $178 million one-time charge related to the elimination of the Rewards forfeiture reserve.","Research we conducted showed that rewards that are easier to redeem and never expire are as valuable to a customer as a higher earn rate. Our adjusted Rewards rate excluding the charge, was 10 basis points higher than last year primarily due to a broader 5% cash back program in the quarter which included both online and department store sales.","Protection product revenue continues to decline down $9 million year-over-year given our suspension of sales in late 2012. Other revenue decreased $11 million primarily due to the reclassification of some merchant fees that we previously discussed several quarters ago. This is the last quarter where this reclassification will impact year-over-year comparisons.","Continuing on slide 6, Payment Services revenue was down $6 million for the quarter primarily due to the loss of the Sam's and Walmart co-brand volume and Network Partners. The transition is now largely completed, but will impact comparisons next year. This combined with the continuing competitive challenges at PULSE and the cost of a lawsuit filed by PULSE against a competitor to address these issues will result in a decrease in profits for our payment segment in 2015.","Turning to slide 7, total loan yield of 11.4% was up 2 basis points over the prior year. The slightly higher loan yield was more than offset by higher funding costs which drove a 5 basis point decline in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.76%. Our cost of funds has increased as we've issued more long-term fixed rate debt over the last year. In addition, we're no longer seeing the same level of benefit from the maturity of CDs priced at rates considerably above those in the market today. These had been creating a meaningful funding cost tailwind in the last few years, but this opportunity has now largely played out.","Turning to slide 8, total operating expense increased by $94 million or 11% over the prior year including $48 million in non-recurring items. One of the non-recurring items was the $27 million impairment of goodwill realized with the Discover Home Loans acquisition. We have not diversified beyond refinance volume into purchase money originations in a meaningful way and therefore we aren't driving a level of originations that we expected. Going forward we'll continue to evaluate our home loan strategy.","The other non-recurring item in other expense was the $21 million mark to fair value related to Diners Club Italy. We acquired DC Italy to support acceptance in the region in June of 2013, but as we've consistently said, it's not part of our strategy to own this franchise long-term. We're now actively engaged in a sales process which is why it has been classified as held for sale.","The three other key drivers of the increase in expenses year-over-year were additional marketing this quarter particularly in card and personal loans to drive new accounts, higher professional fees related to investments in web and mobile and higher employee compensation.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide 9, provision for loan losses was higher by $103 million including a $52 million higher reserve build compared to the prior year. Net charge-offs increased by $51 million driven primarily by loan growth and to a lesser degree, lower dollar recoveries on aged charge-offs. The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.26%, up 17 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was relatively flat at 1.73%.","The private student loan net charge-off rate excluding purchased credit impaired loans was relatively flat year-over-year, at 1.4%. The 30-plus day delinquency rate increased by 14 basis points over the prior year to 1.8%, as the organic book continues to enter repayment. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 20 basis points year-over-year to 2.2% due to the seasoning of growth. And the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 9 basis points to 79 basis points. Across all of our portfolios, we remain pleased with our strong credit results.","Next I'll touch on our capital position on slide 10. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 14.1%. The sequential decrease in our capital ratios was driven by seasonal loan growth as well as continued capital deployment. We repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter. To complete the $1.6 billion dollars of repurchases we submitted as part of last year's CCAR capital actions, we plan to buyback approximately $400 million worth of stock in the first quarter as well.","Moving to 2015 guidance on slide 11, since our annual financial community briefing will be somewhat later this year, we felt it appropriate to provide some select guidance for 2015. We expect revenue margin to decline modestly from 12.9% this year. There are four main drivers of this compression. First, we expect modest NIM compression driven by increasing funding costs as well as a small decline in asset yields. Second, we anticipate protection product revenue will continue to decline. Third, we anticipate a Rewards rate of approximately 105 basis points in 2015 and the fourth driver is the lower payments revenue I discussed earlier.","Moving down the list to provisions, we expect the provision for loan loss rate to increase from 2.2% for 2014 to approximately 2.5% for 2015. As we've been telegraphing, this expectation is primarily driven by the seasoning of several years of consistent loan growth as opposed to a fundamental deterioration in credit.","With respect to operating expenses, we previously stated that we expect our efficiency ratio to be modestly above our 38% long-term target next year. The increase in operating expenses will be driven by higher marketing investments, higher regulatory and compliance costs including those related to remediation of our AML\/BSA program consent order and the impact of increased technology investments.","In conclusion, our outlook for 2015 reflects an end to the declining credit and funding costs that we've enjoyed in recent years as well as some increased regulatory and compliance expenditures. However, most of the fundamental operating trends of the business remain very solid.","That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to our operator Leslie, to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We have Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","So two questions, first, I was wondering, Mark, if you could just dimensionalize how much of a decline you're talking about in the revenue margin when you say modest? Maybe you could just give us some rough sense of that. And then secondly one for David, maybe you could talk about the competitive environment and what you're seeing in terms of yields? Thanks.","Mark Graf","Yes. So, Sanjay, we finished the year with a revenue margin of about 12.9%. We don't give specific EPS oriented guidance, so I'm going to be a little bit probably less specific than you would like me to be, but I can help you at least qualitatively dimension this a little bit. The biggest component of it's going to be a little bit of NIM compression. Again, I think we've consistently been describing that as modest NIM compression and we purposely chose to include the phrase modest in the release again this year. So I wouldn't think about this as a 50 basis point decline in NIM or something on the order of that. We certainly stay well above the long-term targets we've talked about.","Second component that's going into that dimensionalization is obviously going to be your payments revenue. I think we talked during the course of the discussion, about the fact that there is going to be some expense related to the PULSE litigation against VISA that will be creeping in and also while we're growing volumes in the space, a lot of the volume we're growing is B2B volume in our Ariba partnership and it's coming on at a lower margin.","The higher rewards rate, I think we've said about 105 basis points for next year is the right way to think about it and then just to continued attrition of the protection products revenue. So I would say there is nothing I would describe as cataclysmic in terms of those components.","David Nelms","And Sanjay in terms of the competitive environment, I think it's been fairly stable on the yield side. As Mark mentioned, most of the pressure will come more on the cost of funds side and from a competitive perspective, I feel like things are fairly stable overall, but if anything I think there is probably more action in the rewards earn rate from some competitors as opposed to probably on the APR side.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","My question is around, Mark your comments around the provision, the guidance there. I understand you're looking for that to be up year-over-year due to expected seasoning, but what I'm wondering is, is that assuming some deterioration in the delinquency rates that we're not seeing? Because when I look at the data, charge-offs, gross charge-offs are basically still flat year-over-year, net up modestly due to lower recoveries and delinquencies are also pretty flat and stable and your customer just effectively got a raise with lower gas prices. So I'm wondering, what's embedded in your assumptions there?","Mark Graf","I think there is a couple things embedded in the assumptions there, Mark and it's a great question. Number one, I would say is I think we really hit the bottom for this cycle, I would say with respect to credit this last year. So if you look at our reserve to our total loans trending over the course of the last couple years I think you see if you're looking at ending total loans, I think it was 3.8%, 3.9% at the end of 2011. It declined to 2.51% at the end of '13 and we're looking at 2.5% again roughly at the end of last year. So it feels like we've found the bottom there, right. So that's the starting point.","And then on top of that, you look at three years of consistent loan growth that we've put up, whereas most of our peers have returned to loan growth really only like the last six months. And if you think the way a loan seasons, a card loan seasons, it tends to have peak charge-offs between months 18 and 30. So you really have -- that vintage from three years ago is still under the high part of that curve, the vintage from two years is right under the peak part of that curve. The vintage from last year is climbing that slope and you don't have the benefit of the backdrop of the improving credit environment to help mitigate and offset some of the impacts of that growth. So I think it's just an inevitability of the fact we've been growing. It doesn't feel like there is a problem. It doesn't feel like there is a fundamental turn in credit. It's just a function of growth.","Operator","Next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","I was just wondering if you had any updated thoughts on loan growth as we look into 2015. The loan growth that we saw this quarter in credit card and we've seen relatively stable, would you expect to continue to grow around that rate? And then, there has been a little bit of a slowdown in the personal loan business. So some thoughts around loan growth would be helpful.","David Nelms","Sure. Well I think we'll probably have more to say about long-term targets at our Investor Day. But generally, I continue to be very pleased with how strong our loan growth has been, both in this quarter as well as the last few quarters. High end of the industry above our range and coming in with very high quality to boot.","In terms of personal loans, I think the dollars of loan growth have continued to be very strong and what I would expect generally is that the percentage growth rate will tend to start declining a bit, just because of the large numbers, that's becoming a large, sizable loan book, but continues to be the fastest growing part of our portfolio and one of the fastest growth loan books in the industry.","Bob Napoli","And then just on AribaPay, $1.5 billion in volume this quarter. Can you give a feel for the revenue yield you're getting on that and what kind of -- is that $1.5 billion -- how many customers does AribaPay have and how quickly is that going to grow? I mean it's pretty quickly -- $1.5 billion is a pretty big number to hit in a short period of time.","David Nelms","It is, but remember, this is B2B, so even one customer can be very, very sizable and so you look at the size of that market. In total, it's a larger market than consumer credit cards and it's a new market for us, but it's also -- to some degree we're substituting for checks and other lower cost methods of payment than traditional credit cards. So it's a business that we think can produce, over time very significant volumes, but at much lower than the typical network fees that we might expect on the consumer side.","Operator","Next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman","I had two questions, one for Mark and one for David. Mark on slide 8, you were calling out, I thought, three one-time events. I got the Discover Home Loans. I got the Diners Club Italy. I thought that there was a third one. Maybe I missed and then if I could a follow-up afterwards?","Mark Graf","Yes. So there are three one-time items in total, Jamie. The first is the $178 million rewards charge for elimination of the forfeiture reserve. That\u2019s actually a contra-revenue that was covered on another slide and then there is two that are specific on the expense side of the equation and that's going to be about $0.04, $21 million roughly for the diners, fair market valuation and the move to held for sale or the classification of held for sale and then about $27 million or so roughly another $0.04 related to the home loans business.","James Friedman","And then David, with regard to student loans, I just wanted to get your response in the instance that some of the proposals on Capitol Hill go through with regard to community college, I realize you don't extend loans to community college but how should we think about that as competitive dynamic?","David Nelms","I think as you say because we aren't in the community student loan market, I really wouldn't expect that to have a significant impact on our business sort to go through.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Just a question on the outlook for operating expenses, the 3.5 billion, when I think about some of the one-time costs that you outlined for BSA, ML and EMV, it gets the core expense growth rate closer to 3% so I guess, I know we are still far away from 2016 but would you expect any of these expenses to stay in the run rate? And if not do you think we could resume beyond '15 closer to the 3% or 4% growth expense rate?","Mark Graf","Yes, I think there's definitely, Ryan some one-time impacts associated with next year. I think back in December actually at your conference we made mention of the fact that AML\/BSA cost we saw was in the $70 million - $75 million range of something like that so that's clearly a piece of this puzzle. We would not expect that to be a recurring expense.","The other big components of the increase really our marketing expense, David alluded to the launch of a new product and we've also spoken pretty openly about the fact we're getting great new accounts in terms both of numbers as well as the level of activity we're seeing out of those customers. So it doesn't feel like the time when credit is stable we're getting the right kind of results from marketing cost per account acquired are in-line, it doesn't feel the right time to pull back on that either and those are the two big drivers. The other pieces are really some technology spend, big chunk of which is amortization of money that's already been spent. And then there is the litigation that we talked about earlier the PULSE is filed as well. So those are -- they are some of the components there that are clearly have levers that can be dialed back when the time feels right. It just feels when the fundamental business is running well it's not the time to dial some of them back.","Ryan Nash","And just one other financial question for you, when I think about the guidance for net interest margin compression, are there any assumptions for changes in the rate environment embedded in your guidance? And if so, what happens if interest rates don't rise? Does that change the trajectory of the net interest margin?","Mark Graf","Yes. So the assumptions we use as we build off the forward curve which you guys can just always work off the same things, you're going to be looking at the same info we are that way. We have essentially focused our positioning on the multi-year impact of rising rates. Because if you think about it in the one-year timeframe, a card loan and a 10-year student loan react the same way when in reality that's not what will happen. So we're asset sensitive in a one year profile. We're essentially neutralized to the impact of rates through the cycle on the long tier basis as well based on the actions we've done and our actions going forward would be trying to protect that positioning in that multi-year look. It's really kind of where we're spending our attention on how we are focused. The toughest scenario for us is a steep in [inaudible] and we are flat essentially in that today, I think we might lose $9 million or $10 million it's not a lot and we're essentially flat. And a flattener which people are starting to talk about actually would be a slight benefit to us if it occurred on the front end of the curve.","Operator","Next question is from Matthew Howlett with UBS.","Matthew Howlett","The loan growth was strong. Obviously December numbers looked really good. I guess I just wanted a comment on the lower gas prices obviously, retail sales were weak in December and I think just one of your peers just said that that was a disappointment in December. Can you touch on anything in terms of if gas keeps on going lower, what that does potentially to spend or growth loan growth?","Mark Graf","Well, generally I think lower gas prices is great for consumers. So I wouldn't express that as being disappointed. It certainly does have some negative impact on our sales growth and so our sales growth would have been -- with stable gas prices approximately 1% faster year-over-year. I've seen various theories out there as to whether customers you know what do they do with that extra money? Does it help them make their payments and therefore does it help credit? Do they spend it on other things? Do they save it? So far maybe because it's been such a short term and such a significant drop, we haven't noticeably seen it being spent in other places. And so that's why we've kind of called it out as some drag on sales, but good for consumers.","Matthew Howlett","Is it as simple as if it was 10% of your volume like it is for the industry that gas prices fall 50% year-over-year? Did we look at that sort of taking that we just don't know what the difference is going to be if they decide to spend it in other areas? Is that sort of how to think about it?","Mark Graf","I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. And historically it has been about 10% of our sales, right now it's something less than 10% of our sales.","Matthew Howlett","And then just on the personal lending side, I mean it's a phenomenal growth and there was a slight uptick on delinquencies. Is that just sort of seasonality? Clearly there is a lot of competition entering the space. You still feel really good about pricing today in that market?","David Nelms","Yes, I would say it's really more as opposed to seasonality seasoning. Much like in the card business there has been a lot of growth over the course of the last couple years there and you're starting to see the impact of that growth just naturally show up. So don't feel like there is any fundamental credit issue there to call out at all. In terms of the performance of the business, continues to feel very good to us. It's a great asset. The other thing I would call out around it is because I'm presuming your next question is the modest amount of yield compression we've had around that asset and the bottom line is it's not competitively driven. We are seeing our customers elect shorter durations. So if you go back a couple years ago the average duration was four years. Today the average duration is three years and they're fixed rate loans so it's just pricing down further down the curve.","Operator","Next question from Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Arnold","Just wondering if you could comment on what you've seen recently on the split between on card loan growth between new and existing accounts and then maybe comment on the propensity of borrowers to revolve here if you're seeing any kind of changes in borrowing habits there as well?","Mark Graf","I think we've commented in the past that most of our growth is pretty balanced between growth in wallet share from existing customers and better retention of customers. As well as being balanced out with a similar amount from new accounts. And we're continuing to see that as similar relationship.","Jason Arnold","Okay. And then just in general in the industry it seems like we've seen some of your competitors and peers picking up a little bit on loan balances. Maybe if you could broaden out that observation to kind of what your thoughts are around the space in general?","Mark Graf","Well, I think that it does appear that the industry has finally turned the corner and is no longer shrinking. I think some of our competitors lost a lot of loans over the last several years and I guess I would just say that I'm not suggesting that our growth rate will necessarily pick up from here, but I think it's probably easier for us to sustain a higher level of loan growth in a growing industry versus a shrinking industry.","Operator","Next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","I was sort of wondering David, if you could kind of talk a little bit about what -- I know you probably won't be too specific about the new product launch that you alluded to. I mean is it aimed at a different segment or what features should we be looking for?","David Nelms","I don't want to preempt the launch. I would just say we'll have the details out very soon. The one thing I would say is that we do think our Discover It platform is something that can be leveraged into other products that have some of the advantages that Discover It offers including free FICOs and pricing features, lots of features that others don't have, but maybe something a little different than our traditional cash back bonus program. So stay tuned, we'll give you the details real soon.","Moshe Orenbuch","Okay. Just as a follow-up, the provision guidance for 2015 actually is a little lower actually than the provision annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about -- in other words you\u2019re expecting slightly higher credit losses, so maybe kind of square for us why the reserve addition is so large this quarter and actually fairly moderate into 2015?","Mark Graf","Sure. I'll tackle that one, Moshe. I think the real key driver is -- I will take you back to the way we establish our reserves and that is we sit down at the end of every quarter and we look at the loss content we see embedded in the balance sheet over the forward-looking 12 months period of time. And it's really a function of in response to the earlier question as I talked about those three years of vintage [ph] seasoning how they're coming along. It's really a function of how much of those three vintages is under the peak part of that seasoning curve as we sit here and look right now. And it just happens to capture a large a large portion of each of those three vintages. So you're correct. In your assessment of what our guidance is essentially.","Operator","Next question is from Vincent Caintic with Macquarie.","Vincent Caintic","Just wanted to elaborate a bit more on the competitive environment for rewards, with your adjusted rewards rate of 10 basis points year-over-year and say call it five basis points because of your rewards redemption policy, would you say that the other five is stable or has room to grow? Is there more competition? And then also how do you think that plays out in terms of driving spend in loan growth?","David Nelms","Well, I would say that it still will tend to modestly grow from here. Fourth quarter tends to be a heavier quarter. So I'm not saying grow from the 110, but I'm suggesting that on a year-over-year basis in addition to the change in redemption, the changes in redemption and breakage we also have more and more of our book is made up of Discover It that has a flat 1% and less and less of it therefore but fortunately is the up to 1% of our traditional more product. So that will tend to naturally drive it up. I think that as we think about the competitive intensity in rewards, it is one of the reasons we made the change on redemption because customers told us that in some ways, not losing their rewards was even more important than the headline rate. And it was a way for us to meet the competition, have advantages in ways that were greater value to consumers at lower cost to us and therefore is beneficial for us long-term.","Vincent Caintic","Okay. And then switching products if you could describe the goodwill impairment on the Discover home loans and then you're forward view of the business, it seems like refis have been strong with a low rate strong with a low rate environment and just wanted to see what you're also seeing. Thanks.","Mark Graf","It's Mark. I'll tackle that one. If you think about it when you put the goodwill on the books its valued based on the assumptions you have at that point in time and part of those assumptions were that we would have more success bluntly penetrating the purchase money marketplace and wouldn't be as refi dependent as the model is today. So I agree with you if you think about with the drop in loan rates, the refi pipeline probably looks a little bit stronger today than it did a few months back. No question about it, but the purchase money volume that we were counting on when we acquired the business just hasn't materialized yet. So that's really what's driving the impairment. In terms of a go forward look, I would anchor back to David's earlier comments my earlier comments. I think we'll evaluate our strategy around that business and try and figure out what the right thing to do is.","Operator","Next question from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Chris Donat","Mark, just wanted to parse your language around the modest net interest margin compression, particularly on the asset side because I thought David had commented that there really wasn't much pressure on the asset side but I'm wondering if you're seeing a mix shift either in your cards or in the broader loan portfolio that's putting a there? Just wondering if it's something that's one more one-time in nature or more sustainable?","Mark Graf","So how about if I parse it up a little bit more for you? I'm not going to dimensionalize it in terms of the size. Again I would say stick with modest which again I think if we were seeing anything giant, we would not choose the word modest but if you look at the components of the NIM compression about half of it is due to higher funding costs. About a quarter of it is due to lower asset yields and about a quarter of it is due to a combination of loan mix and interest charge-offs which run through margin for us. So that would be the component parts that are driving that NIM compression which again I would really underscore, it's modest NIM compression.","Chris Donat","Got it. I just wanted to make sure I'm getting at here. And then switching gears to another product you mentioned the litigation around PULSE. Going back to September, the American Bankers Association endorsed the Discover Debit product. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any pickup in that or do you think maybe that business has been on hold pending really the Supreme Court non-decision this week to review the Federal Reserve rules implementing Durban? So anyway, looks like now that those rules won't be under the subject to appeal that there is more certainty in that. I'm wondering if you've got any expeditions around the Discover Debit product from here?","David Nelms","You opened up some complicated topics and of course I really can't talk about the litigation part. Let me limit my answer to Discover Debit. We were real pleased with the endorsement by the ABA. We've been pleased with the discussions that we're having with issuers and I think it's early days to sort of accelerate our offering of a signature debit product. We are the only ones in the world who have it besides Visa and MasterCard. And I certainly think we look forward to providing better economics and flexibility than the only two options that have been out there up until this point.","Chris Donat","Okay. And a sales cycle here will be measured in quarters, right? Not weeks or months? Is that fair?","David Nelms","You know if we have significant deals, we would announce them. Certainly there is competitive challenge and I don't think the Supreme Court decision was really one way or another addressing the competitive challenge that is key to the pressure that's on all the pin debit networks in particular us, that I'm concerned about. But we've announced before that we have a dozen or so very small signature debit issuers and we're now starting to get to try to really go after some larger players to grow that volume.","Operator","Next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies Capital.","John Hecht","The question I have pertains to provisioning and charge-off trends. The guidance is premised on the seasoning of the loan balance and lower recoveries. I'm wondering as we step through calendar year '15, do you see these factors neutralizing? I guess what that means is in the absence of changes to the economic outlook or your consumer trends, is this provisioning rate a good trend rate going forward from there?","David Nelms","Yes, I think as you look out it's going to depend on a number of different things. I know you prefaced it being a stable environment but I want to be careful with that one because it is a dynamic process part of which will depend upon what our growth rates look like, right? I mean if our growth rates tick up that would imply a couple years down the road so would the provisioning. If they slowdown that would imply in a stable credit environment that it would slowdown. So it's a multivariate equation so it's not as simple as just saying yes, that feels good. I think the key factors to keep in mind are it's driven by our growth, the fundamental credit backdrop remains really solid at this point in time. If that were to change that could change it. If our growth rate changes that could change it and then the declining recoveries on the aged charge-offs, I'll just remind you it's not a decline in the recovery rate, we're realizing on new charge-offs. It is we have a big pool of aged charge-offs we never sold back from the recession against which there is a declining ability to realize recoveries. That's maybe 10% of the ultimate impact of the increase give or take. So it's a declining percentage there.","Operator","Next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","So I just had a question around the Ariba B2B business. I know you mentioned that it's in the early days, early stages here, but there was a relatively low discount rate on it. Maybe you could give us a sense of what your expectations are for how quickly that business is likely to grow? I know you mentioned that in the payments area you thought that B2B would have a negative impact on the overall discount rate which I get but it's a small piece so I'm wondering how fast you think it's going to grow and if incremental new business would come on at an even lower discount rate than the business you have right now?","Mark Graf","Well, Betsy, I think we are likely to have a little more color by the time we have our Investor Day later this year. If you look at the $1.5 billion of volume just in the fourth quarter, not that long after launching, you can see that it's probably the most volume we've put on from anything this early in a program. So it has the potential to put up a lot of volume if it continues to grow and be successful as the early days suggest, but by definition, it's very low margin business and so if that becomes more material to the payment segment, it will have the impact of depressing the overall margin, but we do believe it will be additive to profits, just not at a very high rate and so overall we think it's a very good thing. It's also a little bit hard for us to predict because the product just hasn't existed in the marketplace because it's unique. Competitors haven't offered it. We are exactly the way we have, we have got a great partner. And it's off to a good start in the early days, but it is still very early days in a very new business.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So I get that and I'm just thinking out loud about how it's B2B, so clearly everyone's doing the math on either side of the table. And I would think that part of the benefit to you is maybe some flow or funding benefits you got from the flow associated with the payments. I don't know if that's accurate or not and I raise it in the context of industry shifted towards real time payments ultimately banking industry moving to real time payments. If that were to happen, would that change the dynamic on the pricing on the product?","David Nelms","As you can imagine, B2B customers are quite sophisticated and so there is one of the benefits is it settles I won't say real time but very quickly. So there is not a lot of flow, there is not a lot of revenue, but it's a way to leverage our network in a way that we've not traditionally been able to leverage the network in a unique way to provide value to new sets of customers and that we think over time there may be additional products and services that can be bundled with it, but right now, we are focused on getting those early customers to be successful and to be feeling good about the product so that this thing can gain momentum. Our partner is the leader globally in this B2B space and so they are very excited about another way to help their customers have more efficient faster payments in a way that's not been available from any provider historically and so we are focused on growing the volume right now and having it flow successfully.","Operator","Next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","I know you've had a couple questions on provision and reserve but I would just like to see if we can understand one thing a little bit better. I'm basically trying to figure out if something's a pattern or a coincidence. A couple of years ago you shifted to a December calendar year-end and what that meant was the sort of peak in terms of receivables December to the trough in receivables, March became more pronounced than when you were on a November to February year-end. And since that time, it looks like there has been a little bit more of a pattern of higher provisions in the fourth quarter and at least the last couple years what we've seen is a little bit of a reversal of that in the first quarter. It would help I think us and other folks to understand if that's something we should anticipate going forward.","David Nelms","Yes, very fair question. I would say two things. Number one, what happens in the first quarter is dependent on what happens in the first quarter. I don't know what that is yet so the reserve will be set at the end of the quarter for what happens during the course of the quarter. But I think it's a very fair statement to say that the shift in the calendar year-end and the way that works did have an impact and influence on that one. I would say it's very modest, though, right? So again I would say what you're really seeing this year speaking to this year specifically is those three years of growth and how much of them happen to be sitting under the peak part, the area under the peak of that seasoning curve at any one point in time.","Operator","And the last question is from Owen Lau with Janney Capital.","Owen Lau","Try to touch on the question on the revenue side again. How should we think about the net interest income in 2015? Just directionally do you see it going up, flat or down? Also on the expense side could you please shed more light on why did you increase spending on the marketing by $27 million year-over-year? So what was the trigger of that? Is it related to the product cycle or high competition on card and personal loans? What was the thought process behind it? Thank you.","Bill Franklin","Owen, it's Bill. Can you repeat the revenue question? The first part of your question? Second question is on expenses and what are driving expenses of I think? And marketing?","Owen Lau","Yes, sure. So on the revenue side, how should we think about the net interest income in 2015? Just directionally do you see it going up or flat or down? How should we think about that?","Mark Graf","Yes, I would say it's going to be a function of a couple different things, Owen. It's going to be a function of asset growth. It's going to be a function of NIM compression. It's going to be a function of asset mix, right. All those different pieces of the puzzle, so in terms of trajectory, I think net interest income will be up, okay, but in terms of the magnitude of that, that's not something I'm prepared to really talk about at this point in time. We don't really give guidance that specific on items like that. On the expense side of the question, I would say specifically that the key drivers of expenses touched on a couple of them earlier. One of them is about $70 million or $75 million for BSA\/AML consent order compliance program compliance. In addition to that I would say there is another not insignificant number related to increased marketing expense, that's really driven by two different things. Number one we continue to see great new account acquisition and we continue to see it come on more actively engaged using the card more frequently and more often than we've seen historically, so the returns on that marketing spend continue to be very good. So we are continuing to invest there and then David also alluded to the launch of a new product here in the not-too-distant future and obviously there is some marketing expense that goes along with that as well.","David Nelms","But I think if you're asking just about that $27 million, it's up 3% year-over-year which isn't that significant. The fourth quarter tends to be our biggest quarter on marketing expenses as we move into holiday periods and we saw that again this year.","Operator","Okay. I'll turn it back to Bill for final remarks.","Bill Franklin","Thanks, Leslie. I would like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. If you have any other follow-up questions feel free to give me a call. Have a good night.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Erica [ph] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2019 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Craig Streem","Thank you, Erica [ph] welcome everybody to our call this afternoon. I\u2019ll begin briefly on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today\u2019s earnings press release and presentation.","Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, covering second quarter highlights, and then Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And after Mark completes his comments there will be plenty of time for question-and-answer session. But we\u2019d limit yourself to one question please and one follow-up so we can make sure that everyone gets one and now beginning on Slide 3.","It\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Hochschild","Thanks Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. Very simply this was another very good quarter for us with solid loan growth, strong net interest margin and ongoing improvements in underlying credit performance. We earned $753 million after tax or $2.32 per share and generated a robust return on equity of 26%. Our ability to balance loan growth with disciplined credit management continues to generate very strong returns while our investments in the Discover brand and advanced technology enhance our ability to drive a differentiated customer experience and competitive advantage, to that point, we were recently awarded the highest ranking by J.D. Power for customer satisfaction among credit card, mobile apps and websites. This recognition highlights how our investments in technology and analytics have enabled us to deliver industry leading customer value while maintaining operating efficiency.","Looking at some of the specifics of our second quarter performance; total loans were up 6%, with strong credit performance across all of our products reflecting our disciplined and underwriting new accounts and line management along with continued investments in collection capabilities. Looking to our lending products, the 7% growth in card receivables was forced from a healthy mix of new, versus existing customers. In terms of card portfolio mix growth was primarily from higher yielding merchandise balances versus promotional balances.","We\u2019ve previously shared with you our intent to decrease the level of growth from promotional activity and that trend continued in the second quarter. This provided a meaningful contribution to our net interest margin performance this quarter. Turning to our student loan business, growth remains strong and as we entered the peak season early origination activity looks good and is consistent with our expectations. We believe, we\u2019re well positioned to continue to gain market share.","In personal loans, our recent credit tightening has achieved its desired effect with both charger off and delinquencies declining from the prior quarter and loan growth consistent with our target. We remain focused on originating loans that will generate satisfactory long-term returns rather that pursuing faster growth in what remains a very competitive environment. Overall, underlying credit trends continue to be favorable across our lending products as the normalization impact on the back book continues to lessen and credit performances increasingly driven by growth in receivables.","Our payment services segment generated a robust 15% increase in pretax income driven by strong growth in volume, that majority of which came from our PULSE business. The team at PULSE continues to win new relationships and build business with existing issuers by developing creative debit solutions that deliver meaningful value for partners. We continue to execute our strategy in payments to enhance global acceptance by investing in partnerships primarily with local acquirers in Western Europe as well as adding to our network-to-network alliance partnerships as we make progress against our objective of universal merchant acceptance.","In summary, our results this quarter reflects a disciplined and commitment to excellence that will bring to serving our customers and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. Clearly, the favorable economic environment is contributed to our performance and we don\u2019t see any signs this is changing in the near-term. Nevertheless, we recognized that this may moderate at some point and are continuing to adapt our growth in credit strategies as appropriate.","Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to highlight two important additions to the Discover team. First, I want to welcome Wanji Walcott, our new Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel. Wanji joins us from PayPal with significant prior experience at American Express shows she brings a wealth of highly relevant knowledge to Discover. I also want to welcome Jennifer Wong, Chief Operating Officer at Reddit who has joined our Board of Directors. Jen will be an invaluable addition to our board bringing deep experience in media and digital advertising.","I will now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail.","Mark Graf","Thanks Roger and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin by addressing our summary financial results on Slide 4. Looking at the key elements of the income statement revenue growth at 10% this quarter was driven by solid loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Looking at the provision for loan losses roughly three quarters of the 6% increase was driven by the seasoning of the loan growth with the remaining 25% reflecting continued supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry.","Operating expenses were up 10% year-over-year due to higher compensation expense and investments in support of growth and new capabilities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at 24%. Turning to Slide 5, total loans increased 6% over the prior year led by 7% growth in credit card receivables. As Roger noted, higher yielding standard merchandized balances were the primary driver of the increase. While the contribution from promotional balances was less of a factor this quarter as it continued to decelerate. Compared to the prior year promotional balances were down 80 basis points and dropped 70 basis points sequentially reflecting our decision to decrease the level of growth from promotional activity over the last several quarters.","Turning to our other primary lending products, our organic student loan portfolio increased to 9% year-over-year while total private student loan balances were up 3%. Personal loans increased 2% which was in line with expectations given the slowdown in our originations which we have mentioned previously.","Moving to the results from our payment segment, on the right-hand side of Slide 5 you can see that proprietary volume was up 4% year-over-year. In payment services, PULSE volume increased 7% over the prior year driven by incremental volume from existing issuers, new issuers on the network as well as growth in our PINless products such as PULSE PAY Express and PULSE e-commerce. Network Partners volume was up 29% primarily driven by Revit BIM. Diners Club volume was up 1% over the prior year having been impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange movements.","Moving to revenue on Slide 6, net interest income increased $203 million or 10% from a year ago driven by higher loan balances and increased market rates. Total non-interest income increased $46 million primarily driven by 14% increase in net discount and interchange revenue. The 5% increase in gross discount in interchange revenue was primarily driven by the year-over-year increase in sales volume which was also up 5%. Rewards cost were flat to the prior year and up a bit sequentially reflecting increases in sales volume, offset by lower utilization in the rotating 5% category. Just to remind you, groceries which we featured in the first quarter is a rotating category that attract the highest level of spending and quarterly shifts in the 5% category can have a significant impact on both the rewards rate and sales volume.","As shown on Slide 7, our net interest margin was 10.47% for the quarter up 26 basis points year-over-year and one basis point sequentially. Relative to the second quarter of last year, the net benefit of prime rate increases in March, June and December 2018 as well as favorable shift in the promotional balance mix and revolve rate were partially offset by higher deposit costs in both brokered and direct consumer, a higher charge offs of accrued interest. Compared to the first quarter, the benefits from two additional cycle days a shift in promo balance mix and a favorable funding mix were mostly offset by the higher cost in brokered and direct consumer deposits.","Looking forward, our outlook for net interest margin reflects continued strong credit performance and favorability in portfolio mix, balanced against a degree of uncertainty around the timing and level of set actions. That said, it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s looking more likely that full year net interest margin will evidence a bit of upside biased we spoke about when we provided 2019 guidance. Total loan yield increased 54 basis points from a year ago to 12.82% primarily driven by an increase of 56 basis points in card yield and a 54 basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases favorability in the revolve rate in a lower level of promotional balances led card yields higher partially offset by an increase in interest charge offs.","As we noted earlier, the mix of lower yielding promotional balances decreased 80 basis points from a year ago reflecting the slowdown in growth from [indiscernible] activity which had a positive impact on card yields and overall NIM. The year-over-year increase in student loan yield was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates as slightly over 60% of the portfolio is at a variable rate. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average consumer deposits grew 16% and now make up over half of total funding. The strong growth in consumer deposits reflects our continued focus on attracting more stable and cost effective funding. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter increasing five basis points sequentially and 49 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see cumulative deposits betas below historic norms. As we consider potential cuts in the feds funds rate. We expect that the results in decline in loan yields would be mostly but not completely offset by lower funding costs. We\u2019ve been trimming our asset sensitivity and expect to be down to roughly three quarters of 1% asset sensitive by the end of the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 8, total operating expenses rose $94 million from the prior year. Employee compensation increased $27 million driven by higher average salaries and benefits which included the impact of the higher minimum hourly wage we implemented in May, 2018. Information processing costs were up reflecting our continued investment in infrastructure and analytic capabilities. Professional fees increased $22 million primarily due to increased collection costs related to higher recoveries in the quarter as well as investments in new capabilities.","Now I\u2019ll discuss our credit results on Slide 9. Total net charge offs rose 11 basis points from the prior year. The increase in charge offs continues to be primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years and to a lesser extent supply driven credit normalization. Credit card net charge offs were 15 basis points higher year-over-year. From a sequential perspective this was the seventh consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge offs and as trend reflects the fact that normalization continues to moderate.","The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 18 basis points year-over-year and down 11 basis points sequentially. Credit performance in the card business continues to be very solid reflecting our disciplined approach to credit management in both new and existing accounts. Private student loan credit performance also remains strong with net charge offs down 31 basis points year-over-year and five basis points sequentially aided by efficiency gains in collections. Personal loan net charge offs were up 36 basis points from the prior year and down 20 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus delinquency rate was up seven basis points year-over-year and decreased two basis points sequentially. Credit performance in the personal loan portfolio continues to stabilize which you can see reflected in the sequential improvements in both charge-offs and delinquency.","Looking at capital on Slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 10 basis points sequentially as loan balances grew. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 82%. We recently announced that our Board of Directors has approved our capital plan for the four quarters ending June 30, 2020 which includes $0.04 per share increase in our quarterly common stock dividend as well as planned share repurchases up to $1.63 billion over the new four quarters. I\u2019ll remind you we were not subject to CCAR for 2019 but will require [indiscernible] capital plan that was approved by our Board of Directors and submitted to regulators.","As always, we remain committed to efficiency deploying our shareholders capital by focusing on profitable and disciplined asset growth and returning excess capital via dividends and share repurchases. To sum up the quarter on Slide 11, we generated 6% total loan growth and 26% return on equity. Our consumer deposit business saw a strong growth of 16% while deposit rates increased 49 basis points year-over-year. With respect to credit, while our charge off rates have increased as loan growth seasons and credit conditions normalized performance reflects positive trends across our lending products and remains consistent with both our expectations and our return targets. And last but not least, we\u2019re continuing to execute on our capital plan with loan growth in capital returns helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels.","In conclusion, this was a terrific quarter for us characterized by continued receivables growth, solid credit performance and very strong returns. That concludes our formal remarks, so I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator Erica [ph] to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Solid quarter and Mark, sorry to see you leaving next year but it\u2019s been great working with you. Question on CECL I guess and hopefully you\u2019re not leaving because of CECL mark. I know that\u2019s frustrated you there a little bit. Can you \u2013 the reserve build, do you have an idea what do you expect the reserve build to be and then, maybe more importantly after the reserve build, just any thoughts you would have on, what effect CECL would have on earnings growth over the long-term, on average overtime?","Mark Graf","Sure. First of all, Bob, I would say thanks for the kind words. I appreciate it. I have enjoyed working with you and all the folks in the market tremendously over the last nine years so I\u2019m not gone yet so you got to suffer through with me for a little while. In terms of CECL, I would say Bob there\u2019s no change to our 55% to 65% guesstimate for the increase in reserves at adoption of CECL. Now I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t remind you that is a guesstimate, it\u2019s heavily dependent on both the composition and trends in the portfolio and the forward-looking view of the economy actually at the time we adopt. But again, if we had adopted this quarter it looks like roughly a 55%, 65% range would be the right way to think about it.","In terms of where that impact comes in, its longer duration, higher lifetime loss content assets and [indiscernible] managed asset classes are obviously pretty heavily depended on a macro factor in a CECL environment. So, the volatility going forward I think is really going to be the speed and level of change in macroeconomic forecast will really be the driver in volatility as you sit and look at those things in addition to loan growth, itself right. There\u2019s a penalty for growth under CECL, so those would be the moving parts and pieces.","I think our number one concern remains comparability across issuers is going to be challenging. So, it\u2019s going to be incumbent upon us to provide really good disclosure and for all the users of the financial statements to really dig in there.","Bob Napoli","The capital return is a little bit below what we were looking for is that because of CECL, was just trying to figure out, is that all related?","Mark Graf","So CECL and the implementation of CECL definitely impacted our thoughts in terms of the forward four quarter ask in terms of the [indiscernible] or churn basis, yes.","Bob Napoli","Great, so I thought. Thank you appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Q \u2013 Rick Shane","I wanted to ask a little bit about transition on promotional rates. I\u2019m curious what the results have been with promotional balances that you\u2019ve been able to convert to full pay in the way that you anticipated. Is the NPV MF [ph] program what you expected?","Roger Hochschild","Promotional balances remain very profitable for us and it\u2019s a mix of using promo rates around ET and retail for new accounts as well as targeted offers to our existing portfolio so profitability has been very strong. It\u2019s just some of the growth we\u2019re seeing around merchandized balances and some other forms of stimulation including rewards are working well and so that\u2019s driving down the overall mix that\u2019s at promotional rates.","Mark Graf","And in terms of NPV part of the question I would say, yes, the NPV\u2019s continue to perform in line with expectations and candidly some of the level of focus on promotional balances obviously as you know, do we believe in the current environment based on competitor actions and otherwise. Do we have the ability to keep hitting those NPV\u2019s and if we can\u2019t, we pull back because we don\u2019t want to put asset growth on the books that doesn\u2019t meet our desired return thresholds?","Q \u2013 Rick Shane","Great, thank you. And then, you\u2019ve alluded to the fact that you\u2019ve been able to implement some strategies to dampen asset sensitivity. Can you talk a little bit about that?","Mark Graf","Yes, principally what we\u2019ve been doing is over the course of the last several months we\u2019ve been adding to our invest portfolios specifically buying short dated treasuries [indiscernible] two years in. it\u2019s been the primary vehicle we\u2019ve used to accomplish that dampening on the asset sensitivity side. I think realistically there\u2019s a little bit more room there to add, a little bit more on the treasury book. But and there also be some synthetic activities will engage in to do principally and then asset swaps will be the way to think about it. We\u2019re in market today, with an ABS floater, a two-year ABS floater. Specifically, we won\u2019t swap that fix, the way we\u2019ve done over the years with a number of our ABS floaters as well, that will also help in that capacity that\u2019s about $800 million deal roughly give or take.","Q \u2013 Rick Shane","Thank you, guys, very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Q \u2013 Mark DeVries","Was hoping you could help us better understand the pace of reserve builds. While the year-over-year increases in delinquencies and charge offs have been improving at a fairly steady pace changes and the reserve ratios have been more erratic with some quarters like this one, where there\u2019s almost no change sequentially and quarters like the last one where it was up 17 basis points. And this quarter is kind of flat was actually in a period where, for the first time in a while you actually saw your year-over-year delinquencies increase. So, I was hoping Mark, you could just give us kind of sense of how to think about on a quarterly basis, what causes you to move your reserve up or down?","Mark Graf","Sure. So today pre-CECL, we set our reserve base on expected losses on loans that are on the balance sheet now and it will be the losses we expect to see over the coming 12 months and the key really influencers of that level are going to be delinquency trends we see in the portfolio, macroeconomic trends and forecasts. Obviously, bankruptcy forecast what we see going on incident rates and what we see happening with consumer leverage and abilities to pay.","Where \u2013 would be the key influencers I guess that will be out there today Mark and I think the other thing is we try and not to react with a knee-jerk reaction one quarter versus the next. So, when we see some goodness, we\u2019ve got a relatively flat reserve rate this quarter vis-\u00e0-vis last quarter, we saw a little bit of goodness in a couple areas. We\u2019re not just going to assume that represents a trend we\u2019re going to wait and see that developed and we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re being prudent in how we think about trends in the portfolio as oppose to just knee-jerk reacting up and down.","As we go into CECL environment I think that level of judgment will increase candidly but we will become far more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic forecast as well as the level of growth in the portfolio in a CECL environment as well, so that would be how to think about it now and really how to think about it going forward.","Q \u2013 Mark DeVries","Okay that\u2019s helpful. But then when we think specifically about this quarter versus last quarter, what did you see maybe differently in all those different things you evaluate that because you keep reserves mostly unchanged, is the reserve ratio versus last quarter where there\u2019s a more substantial increase.","Mark Graf","I mean the reserve rates stayed relatively flat. I think we saw constructive activity on a quarter-over-quarter basis in delinquency trends. We saw constructive developments in quarter-over-quarter trends in charge off trends. Macro trends a little less clear candidly then we would have seen historically not relatively flat, but uncertainty around what the [indiscernible] is going on the with the fed quite honestly, would be entering into that process. Incident rates up a tad but nothing significant. I mean there\u2019s no question severity remains the primary driver.","Consumer leverage pretty consistent so you kind of put all that into the blender and hit go, I suppose you could have gotten yourself comfortable with a modest reserve rate reduction, but we don\u2019t target a reserve rate again we set reserves based on the loans we see on the books and all those factors we talk about earlier and we want to see those factors develop over more than just a month or two. We actually want to see them develop into trends before we responded as trend because most importantly those reserves are meant to reflect the risk that we as a management team feel exist in the loan book today and not just to knee-jerk quarter-over-quarter based on things we see moving.","Q \u2013 Mark DeVries","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Mihir for Jason. Just quick question on the purchase volume. Is there anything you would call out in terms of the Discover card purchase volume other than just the different category in reward because well you saw a little bit of slowdown this quarter? I think it was up 4.5% plus there\u2019s even 6.5% last quarter and so I was just wondering, is there anything particular there?","Mark Graf","Couple of things, one when you look at us compared to competitors ours is explicitly more of a lend focus model versus spend focus because sometimes there\u2019s a bit of disconnect, part of it was just a challenging comp year-over-year. The switch in 5% category probably caused us roughly almost a point of growth, the other thing is gas prices can have an impact and so that also dampened our year-over-year sales growth.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you and then just, can you give us an update on the checking products, the one with the rewards. What kind of engagement are you seeing from the customers, is the population different that are attractive to this product, whether it\u2019s millennial versus your card product if you will and is there an opportunity to drive that growth a little further in the interest rate as you know, if the interest rate environment is we\u2019re expecting with the lower outside funds rate maybe and might see a little bit less yield chasing.","Mark Graf","The benefits of checking compared to other products actually gets tougher in a lower rate environment just because in checking you\u2019re not paying interest, but you\u2019re paying OpEx and so as rates come lower the advantage of checking versus say saving starts to get compressed. We continue to be excited about how checking is performing, the average age of new customer is about 35, our card actually does well with students and millennial too, but we\u2019re excited about the product about a quarter of the new customers are also opening a savings account, so exciting about that, we\u2019re seeing good growth year-over-year in new account. So, it continues to be a good product for us but I would caution you, we view it as a long-term build before checking deposits become a meaningful piece of our funding. The role \u2013 the direct to consumer deposit portfolio is doing very well and as we mentioned on the call, it\u2019s not over half of our funding.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Q \u2013 Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess I have a question on loan growth obviously the card growth continues to be strong and the mix is actually improving to less promo. Could you just talk about what driving this window to be open for you for this long Roger and maybe you could also just talk about how you\u2019re incorporating the shift views on the macro and to the underwriting process?","Roger Hochschild","We have not, I\u2019ll start with the back of that Sanjay. We haven\u2019t changed our views on macro, we continue to be at the margin tightening credit and nothing is changed there in terms of how we think about our card underwriting. I think the window is there, as long as we can execute around having a compelling value proposition in a very competitive environment and so we always target a healthy mix of loan growth coming from both new accounts as well as stimulating our existing card accounts. We\u2019re happy with how it\u2019s performing but we continue to see good opportunities as well.","Mark Graf","And it continues to skew toward prime oriented solid growth Sanjay if you something you\u2019ll see in our Q as it comes out at the end of the quarter [indiscernible] front run a little bit, the percentage of accounts at or below 660 actually decreased to about 19% in the quarter. So, you\u2019re seeing the percentage of the book that\u2019s actually classified as subprime begin to shrink as well.","Q \u2013 Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay and then just a follow-up for you Mark. I appreciate the commentary on the NIM in lower rates, so far but maybe you can just backing up a little bit more high level talk about deposit betas and how they may vary early in the process of rates going down versus later in the process because we were seeing that difference as we were going late into the rate rising cycle, so maybe you could just talk about those dynamics.","Mark Graf","Yes sure. We typically it\u2019s not unusual for deposit pricing to continue increasing after market rates stop. So, we did see a little bit of that across the industry, more recently we\u2019ve seen decreases including some of our product book as well. We\u2019ve implemented rate decreases also. So last quarter when we talked Sanjay the cumulative beta through the cycle was 51, the cumulative through the cycle as we sit here today is 49. So at the end of the day obviously competitor actions will have a bearing on how we act and respond because we are trying to be relevant to the market, we continue to target that sixth to tenth kind of place in bank rate to offer real significant value but not to have rate due to leading proposition, so that\u2019s generally how I would think about it.","On the NIM question more broadly, I guess what I\u2019d say is, I mentioned we did see a little bit of upside biased to the upside when we gave our guidance in, we\u2019re really seeing that be more likely right now I\u2019m guessing NIM could come in anywhere from call it five to 9 basis points roughly higher than 10.3 that was part of our initial guide. I think want to make sure folks don\u2019t overreact to the growth we\u2019ve seen in NIM and really make extrapolate that as well because we are asset sensitive still roughly 25 basis point increase by the fed on a 12-month forward basis takes about a basis point or two off a margin give or take. It\u2019s kind of the way to think about it and those treasuries we\u2019ve been buying to dampen our asset sensitivity also are \u2013 that lower yields than some other things as well.","So, I mean we\u2019re doing the right things to prudently position the balance sheet. NIM is going to be clearly on the plus side of that guide with the biased to the upside but I don\u2019t want folks to runway and assume it\u2019s going to the moon either.","Q \u2013 Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs","Q \u2013 Ryan Nash","When I look at credit broadly, so net charge offs year-to-date running kind of towards the bottom of the range 3Q historically it\u2019s seasonally strong for losses. Can you maybe just talk by-product, how you\u2019re feeling about the trajectory of losses and giving positive seasonality, could we end up coming in at or below the low end of your 3Q to 3.4 targeted range? Thanks.","Mark Graf","Yes, I\u2019m not going to get into the trap of revising guidance on you on the credit one here, but I\u2019ll be happy to walk you through the parts of pieces. I would say, card Ryan continues to feel very stable and very good. I would say that from that perspective this is the seventh consecutive quarter, we saw the rate of increase in charge offs moderate year-over-year. The rate of growth moderate year-over-year, we still are seeing the impacts of normalization but it\u2019s down to roughly call it a quarter of the impact. The other three quarters is really coming from growth and as our loan growth has moderated a little bit, our guidance for the year is six to eight, as we\u2019re coming in closer to that six-ish percent kind of range so far, I would say that has bearing on that equation a little bit as well, so it feel to me at the end of the day like we\u2019re in a good shape with respect to trends in card charge offs. If we talk student loans that product has consistently just been a very solid credit performer for us. Don\u2019t see any signs of change on that horizon at all it just continues to feel decidedly solid I would say.","Personal loans, too early to declare victory but it is looking like that 5% general soft guide we gave around personal loan charge off rates because of working through some of those segments that we talked about going back about a year or so ago. It looks like that was probably a little conservative, so I do think our personal loan charge offs will come in inside of that 5% number, you saw really positive quarter-over-quarter trends this time again I\u2019m not going declare a victory on the basis of quarter. But I do feel like things are trending well there as well. So not prepared to revise credit guidance at this point in time, but I would say we continue to feel really good about the trajectory of credit, the performance of credit and the health of the book.","Q \u2013 Ryan Nash","Got it and sorry to ask you another question on the net interest margin. But if I look year-to-date, you\u2019re running at close to 10.47, the guidance would impact about a 20-basis point fall off in the back half which is historically seasonally strong. So, I guess I just want make sure I understand all of the moving pieces given that, you\u2019re slightly asset sensitive, your better seasonality. But then you also have lower promo activity which is helping support the margin. So, if you just walk us through the puts and takes of how we end up with the margin, the back half of the year that\u2019s lower relative to the first half. Thanks Mark.","Mark Graf","Yes, I\u2019ll do my best and I would not interpret this as being to be all inclusive but I\u2019ll give you some things to think about. So, as we head into the latter part of the year transact or engagement typically tends to pick up as we go into the holiday shopping season. So, you\u2019ll have a bigger percentage of the mix that essentially is effectively a 0% earning asset, so that has an effect \u2013 is there that you should be thinking about at the end of the day. The asset sensitivity depending upon the pace of the fed, the guidance we have implies right now. Our guidance would imply 25 coming up here shortly and 25 in the fourth quarter, if the pacing is greater than that, it would have a bigger impact and I already said 12-month forward a basis 0.1 or 0.2 for every 25 the way to think about that. Those portfolio purchases have a dampening effect of the treasury.","On the promo piece, we don\u2019t expect that to continue to decline from its current levels. We\u2019re thinking the level we\u2019re sending that right now is a percentage of mix feels about right. So, you won\u2019t have further tailwind from promo at this point in time. So those will be some of the things I would generally would be thinking about Ryan it\u2019s not all inclusive but I\u2019m trying to send a balance message on NIM. It\u2019s clearly a good story it\u2019s going to end up higher than that 10.3 that we had talked about, but I don\u2019t want folks to think we\u2019re sandbagging and setting something up we it\u2019s going to moon either. I\u2019m trying to send a very balanced, very clear message there.","Q \u2013 Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Q \u2013 Bill Carcache","My first question is on rewards and promotional activity. I know it\u2019s early in the quarter, but can you discuss whether include PayPal and this quarter\u2019s 5% cash back rewards category whether you had expect that to drive a pickup in volumes and how should we think about the sustainable rewards rate level, as we look ahead from here in light of the decrease that we saw this quarter.","Roger Hochschild","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the decrease this quarter. We talked about how the categories can have a significant impact to Q-over-Q but that doesn\u2019t change our long-term perspective. We\u2019re very excited about the program with PayPal. They\u2019re a great partner, so but just given their overall scale I would say modest impact on rewards in the coming quarter.","Mark Graf","On a full year basis, I would say we aren\u2019t moving that guide we gave for the year that 1.32 to 1.34 so it definitely does tend to move around based on how lucrative that category is. So, like in the first quarter, groceries it\u2019s really easy to max out on the $1,500 in spend. I think you have to spend $125 a week or something inside of that even to max out. It\u2019s really easy to do. Certain of the other categories it\u2019s not as easy to max out on that if you unless you\u2019re a high spend transactor. So, we do see variability based on that as well, but the guide for the year the 1.32 to 1.34 is still I think, how would be thinking about it.","Q \u2013 Bill Carcache","Got it. Thanks, helpful. Thanks Roger and Mark. My last question is regarding your digital investments and specifically on cloud you guys have talked about pursuing a hybrid cloud strategy versus the public cloud strategy that some of your competitors are pursuing. Can you discuss whether you have any concern that first of all you may be falling behind your competitors and secondly maybe if you could discuss what you\u2019re seeking to optimize with your strategy.","Roger Hochschild","So, in terms of hybrid cloud versus sort of moving purely to the public cloud. I think our focus around technology, it was always technology to drive business value not technology for technology sake. I mean so we try and take a really practical view, so moving 100% of your applications to the public cloud, moving your general ledger. I might actually see the benefit. On some of the consumer facing applications we have migrated to the cloud and we\u2019ve written architecture, you\u2019re seeing 30% plus increases in feature delivery rate, so clear benefits from public cloud but we feel like our hybrid strategy is the right way to go.","In terms of falling behind our competitors on technology. I maybe think more about what\u2019s the opportunity in front of us versus comparing because everyone\u2019s business a bit different. Certainly, we\u2019re doing a great job in business value, if you look at what we\u2019ve done to mobile space being number one rank there. But I\u2019m also excited about how quickly technology is changing and what we can do in the coming years.","Q \u2013 Bill Carcache","It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","Q \u2013 John Hecht","Actually, most of my questions have been asked, so I just have one. Roger you referred to a good mix of sources of growth from new customers and increasing advances. Can you parse out that gives a little bit more information of the growth? How much of its coming from utilization versus advances versus new customers?","Roger Hochschild","I\u2019d guess a bit more from new customers versus the portfolio so probably for the last roughly 18 months, we\u2019ve been close to that 60-40 range between the two, maybe a little higher this quarter. But again, a healthy mix, so it\u2019s consistent really with what we\u2019ve done for a while now.","Q \u2013 John Hecht","Okay and I guess it\u2019s related \u2013 how would you discuss the competitive environment, you guys have used the word competitive quite a bit, but has it leveled off, is there changing dynamics on competition for new customers and rewards or how do we think about that?","Roger Hochschild","We said for a while that rewards competition has leveled off. Going back a couple of years it was just every quarter someone was out there with a hot new program, so it\u2019s stable. The card business is always very competitive. If you look at the returns and so it\u2019s really the same competitors pursuing it aggressively and that\u2019s just a constant state for the business.","Q \u2013 John Hecht","Great, thanks very much for the color.","Operator","And your next question is from Vincent Caintic with Stephens.","Q \u2013 Vincent Caintic","Most of my questions have been answered or raised. So maybe just switching gears to the expense side, so on Slide 8 very helpful color on some of the expense growth. If you could talk about maybe in some more detail about information processing and the professional fees and other expenses those are up on the double-digit range. Is that something we should expect to continue going forward or is there one-time things and specifically for the investments infrastructure and capabilities maybe you could discuss that further into the deal. Thank you.","Mark Graf","Sure, if you think about the information technology spend, I think that really is the battle field on which the bank of the future is being built quite honestly. So, I would not expect to see technology spend be something you\u2019d look to see [indiscernible] back on anytime soon. Obviously, we have a leverage there, if we were hit downturn a major bump in the road, something like that. But it feels like those investments are driving great returns, you\u2019re seeing it already in some of the performance in our personal loan book as we\u2019re able to better weed out some of the challenges we were faced with their if you will, you\u2019re seeing it across the board in the portfolio so we feel good about that.","If you\u2019re talking about the professional fees, I think on that piece to the puzzle yes I believe there\u2019s some lumpiness to that ones I think you\u2019ll see that one continue to be exhibit a degree of lumpiness and I would not take that as an elevated run rate or something that I would expect to see on a normalized basis. On the other category that was up $28 million. I would say the variance there, it\u2019s about $11 million year-over-year due to global acceptance about $13 million and this year I think that it was about $2 million in it, last year same quarter something like that and about $9 million of that is driven by fraud reserve. We had a second quarter of 2018 last year we had a reserve release in the fraud reserve. This year second quarter we had a normal build driven consistent with loan and deposit growth.","The end of the day those would be the big drivers in the other, other. So, continue to feel good about the expense guide broadly for the full year and continue to feel that there is significant untapped leverage in the expense base that we can avail ourselves of, if and when we see a shift in the environment.","Roger Hochschild","And maybe to build off Mark\u2019s comment. You can see great stability in operating efficiency even as we made those increases in investments in technology and I think that reflects really our discipline around expenses that to the extent we need to make investments. We\u2019re going to look hard at everything and see how we can fund this.","Mark Graf","And actually, we\u2019re at not to peak season DSL [ph] expenses that you incur, your efficiency ratio actually this quarter would have come in at 37.1. So, I think yes and I feel really good about the expense guide and I feel very good about the leverage that exist there.","Q \u2013 Vincent Caintic","Okay, got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank.","Q \u2013 Meng Jiao","A quick question just on M&A. I think earlier this year you guys spoke to \u2013 would be loving to do acquisitions at payment space, but you noted that valuations are high. I just wanted to get any sort of updated thoughts that you guys had in terms of M&A space whether it relates to payment space or direct US banking. Thanks.","Roger Hochschild","I think the same comments still holds through, we love to do acquisitions in payments and valuations are still high. So, if you look back over the years both PULSE and Diners were transformational acquisitions in the payment side. But Mark and his team are on a very disciplined process and we\u2019re focused on value and making sure that transactions work out well for our shareholders. On the banking side there\u2019s probably a bit less to get excited about just buyer portfolios is it\u2019s like buying a bond and we\u2019re very happy with the presence we\u2019ve built in the products we\u2019re in on the consumer side. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily encourage you to think about any acquisitions on the direct banking side, we\u2019ll look at anything opportunistically but we feel good and I think quarter shows there\u2019s a lot we can do around organic growth.","Craig Streem","Erica [ph].","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Q \u2013 Chris Donat","I wanted to ask about the competitive environment for deposits because Mark I thought I heard you say that you have put some decreases in the product book and we\u2019ve seen Ally [ph] and the Marcus product from Goldman Sachs we\u2019ve seen some incremental reductions just trying to get a sense of how confident you feel that you can trim deposit rates without having any adverse impact.","Mark Graf","So, I would say, that is always the $64,000 question. I think the real question out there is, where do you see it on a relative basis. Right. You have to be in the relevant range in the market place. I think do we have the ability to lead the market down in the terms of deposit pricing. No, I don\u2019t think we have the ability to lead the market down in deposit pricing we didn\u2019t lead it going up either. Do I feel like the betas that we\u2019ve built into our asset liability models and the guidance we provided around NIM and other things for the year continue to feel really good and do I feel like that is a business that continues overtime to look more and more like a traditional banks deposit business where there\u2019s real relationship, yes I do.","I mean I think when I look most recently, I think we\u2019re just a hair shy of 70% of our depositors now have the relationship with us on the asset side of the balance sheet. Right, so I feel very good these are not hot money quasi-capital markets accounts and I feel very good about our ability in a declining rate environment to harvest some benefit there.","Q \u2013 Chris Donat","Okay, that makes sense. Then just kind of curiosity wise on the upper end of the competitive spectrum we\u2019ve seen. Robo-advisors like better manual front get a little more aggressive on deposit products using [indiscernible] traditional bank product, but using bank relationships to get FDIC \u2013 anyway you\u2019ve seen meaningful competition from there or is that really hitting kind of different part of the marketplace and you\u2019re targeting for deposits.","Roger Hochschild","Yes, we haven\u2019t seen any impact from that.","Q \u2013 Chris Donat","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Q \u2013 Moshe Orenbuch","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I was hoping to kind of talk a little bit to couple of questions before that competitions. Your marketing spend was flattish as you mentioned that rewards category in Q2 didn\u2019t had a lower level. I mean as you look in the second half, I mean is there an opportunity to take more share, to generate a little better growth in either lending or spending or both.","Mark Graf","We tend to think about it in terms of the ROI for the marketing dollars we put out there. If you think product by product certainly seasonally, you\u2019re going to start seeing ramp up in Q3 given the peak for student loans. For personal loans, we were very explicit about trimming back from channels based on credit performance but also that we\u2019re starting to see the benefits from that in terms of the losses and the new generation of models going in. fourth quarter tends to be heavy for card, so yes I think you can expect to see us continue to invest and look to gain share particularly around student loans and card. Personal loans I think you want to not pursue share and growth there too aggressively that\u2019s really driven by return and we\u2019ve been very vocal over years now. There are times to market that product and there are times to cut back and we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined.","Q \u2013 Moshe Orenbuch","Got it, thanks and maybe just a follow-up for Mark. You\u2019ve always used capital markets funding in conjunctions with deposits and as we\u2019re getting into this declining rate environment and to the extent that the industry doesn\u2019t cut as fact. I mean would you kind of switch over to a greater degree of that capital markets funding.","Mark Graf","I\u2019d say, I think about a little bit like a constrained optimization Moshe. At the end of the day I think over the long haul the value of a true relationship oriented deposit base can\u2019t be replicated so I would still have a bias that general direction. That being said, we\u2019re economically motivated and to the extend the cost of funding and the capital markets really started to gap out, sure. Be willing to do that at the end of the day. Subject to maintaining good discipline around asset liability management and make sure we\u2019re not doing anything that is near term beneficial, but plans land mines in the forward P&L when those things mature or reprice [ph], but sure be willing to consider.","Q \u2013 Moshe Orenbuch","Yes, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Q \u2013 Betsy Graseck","Couple of questions, first for Mark. Just want to make sure, your commentary around for every 25 bps, 1.2 basis points that I think last quarter was four to six so just want to make sure I heard that right as well as just understand the [indiscernible] differential all the actions that you discussed earlier, is that 1.2 for the second half of the year or is that 3Q and so we should expect an even lower level of impact as we hit 4Q?","Mark Graf","So, the four to six Betsy would have been predicated that goes back maybe two quarters ago and it\u2019s predicated on what the benefit would be from a rate increase. We\u2019re now looking at what the likely cost of a rate decrease would be and it wasn\u2019t symmetrical the way we built it, so you\u2019re looking at one to two basis points of cost to margin on a 12-month forward basis associated with a 25 basis point reduction and we\u2019re continuing to shift the asset sensitivity. So, I would expect overtime that will moderate from that current one to two basis points level as we continue to shift the positioning of the balance sheet.","Q \u2013 Betsy Graseck","Got it and that\u2019s against spot or that\u2019s against the forward curve.","Mark Graf","That\u2019s against the forward curve.","Q \u2013 Betsy Graseck","Got it, okay. And then Roger question for you in the prepared remarks you were talking a bit about the European opportunity and how you saw some of that come through this quarter. Could you give us a sense as to, which kind of markets you\u2019re seeing the uptake the most rapidly and where you feel you are in terms of opportunity set here is, what we saw this quarter something that you can continue for a while or do you think anything in particular, hey this is more of a one quarter event.","Roger Hochschild","I think for us probably a lot of focus is around Spain, but also the UK and Ireland. Some of the smaller markets we\u2019re seeing great success and exciting partnership. So, Bulgaria is another one highlight this really is a multi-year strategy different countries will link in and out, but it\u2019s a broad focus across Western Europe.","Q \u2013 Betsy Graseck","Okay so early innings because these are not necessarily new markets for you but they are new given the relationships that you extended recently it\u2019s an accelerating growth path, is that fair?","Roger Hochschild","Yes, and some of them while, clearly, we\u2019re in hundreds of countries around the world, some of these reflect I would say step function changes in terms of merchant acceptance within those markets.","Q \u2013 Betsy Graseck","Okay, so we could see these paces continue as your relationships build out in these markets.","Roger Hochschild","Yes.","Q \u2013 Betsy Graseck","Okay, thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Streem, your closing comments please.","Craig Streem","Thanks Erica [ph]. Thank you all for your interest. We appreciate your queuing up with us in light of who else maybe out there this afternoon and anything else you need of course, feel free to come back to us. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin, Investor Relations. Mr. Franklin, you may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Ellen. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us on this afternoon\u2019s call. Let me start on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is on our website and we will be referring to during the call.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC today in an 8-K report, and in our 10-K, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the first quarter 2014 earnings materials, which are posted on our website and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.","Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for question-and-answer session.","Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David Nelms","Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Since I recently presented Discover\u2019s strategic priorities and key initiatives at our annual financial community meeting, I\u2019ll keep my prepared remarks brief on today\u2019s call.","During the first quarter of this year, the actions and results that we drove help take us a step closer to achieving the priorities that I discussed at the event. Specifically, we grew card receivables by nearly 5% which is at the upper end of our targeted range. We achieved this level of growth through wallet share gains with existing customers, and the continued success of Discover it, where we drove a double-digit increase in new accounts.","We\u2019ve added innovative features like free FICO Scores on card member statements and continue to enhance our online application to drive new accounts. Card sales volumes growth in the quarter was 3%. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the majority of sales growth in the industry at the moment is coming from high spend transactors, while profitability in the industry for the most part is still driven by receivables, not sales.","Our card business is focused on prime revolver sales and we\u2019ve been taking share in this segment. Furthermore, we are not sacrificing quality to achieve growth as credit in our card business continues to remain exceptionally strong.","Next, we continue to leverage our brand, our customer base and our risk management skills to profitably grow and expand our newer direct banking products. Private student loans excluding purchased loans grew by 26% during the quarter. And personal loans grew by 27%.","In these businesses, we are not only driving solid growth, but we\u2019re also achieving great returns on equity. In addition, we are piloting our student loan consolidation product which we expect to further rollout later this year, and we\u2019re making good progress towards implementing the core banking system, which will better position us to more broadly launch our direct checking product later this year.","In payments, we continue to increase global acceptance, enhance security and look for ways to partner to increase volume while navigating through some clear challenges in the segment. Despite these challenges in the payment segment, the first quarter overall was a great start to 2014. Our core lending business drove 6% receivables growth and 4% revenue growth. We generated $631 million in net income or $1.31 per diluted share with the return on equity of 23%.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark and he\u2019ll walk through the detail of our first question results.","Mark Graf","Thank you, David, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll start by going through the revenue detail. It\u2019s on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.","Net interest income increased $153 million or 11% over the prior year, due to continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income decreased $67 million to $515 million, primarily due to lower direct mortgage-related income, and an increase in our rewards expense. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 103 basis points. Of this total, roughly 7 basis points or approximately $18 million was related to updating our assumptions to reflect lower reward forfeitures going forward. Excluding this one-time adjustment, our rewards rate for the quarter would have been 96 basis points.","The decrease in forfeitures is driven by good credit performance and our efforts to increase either redemption like we\u2019ve done with Amazon to drive customer engagements. In terms of the more business as usual elements of the program, we modestly increased both the standard and promotional rewards over the prior quarter.","Payment services revenue decreased 9% year-over-year, mainly due to lower transaction processing margins at PULSE, which will have somewhat easier comps next quarter as pricing changes were implemented during the first half of last year. Overall, we grew total company revenues by 4% in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.44% was 22 basis points higher than the prior year, as interest yield for card, private student and personal loans all increased. The year-over-year increase in card yield reflects a higher portion of balances coming from revolving customers, as well as lower interest charge-offs. Higher total loan yield, combined with the lower funding costs, resulted in a 48 basis point increase in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.87%. Looking forward, we continue to expect net interest margin to remain elevated above our long-term target for sometime to come.","Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $31 million or 4% over the prior year. The increase in employee compensation was primarily related to higher headcount to support growth and new product initiatives, as well as compliance with increased regulatory requirements.","Information processing expenses were up $6 million or 8 %, largely due to a reclassification of expenses that were previously included in employee compensation and benefits in the second quarter of last year. Other expense was up $9 million or 10% due to the inclusion of a legal reserve release in the first quarter of last year.","Payment services expense increased by $9 million or 23% due to ongoing Diners Club cost in Europe. For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was 37.7%, roughly in line with our long-term 38% target.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $113 million compared to the prior year, due to a smaller reserve release. Our $57 million reserve release for the quarter mainly reflects an improvement in both our contractual and bankruptcy loss assumptions for the card product.","The credit environment for cards continues to remain extremely benign. Sequentially, the credit card net charge-off rate increased by 23 basis points to 2.32%. However it decreased by 4 basis points over the prior year. 30-plus day delinquency rate of 1.72% remained at the same level as the prior quarter.","The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding our purchased loans, increased 49 basis points from the prior year, due to a larger portion of the portfolio entering repayments. Student loan delinquencies, excluding acquired loans, increased 31 basis points to 1.79%. Overall, student loan portfolio continues to seize and generally in line with our expectations.","Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 7 basis points sequentially and the over 30-day delinquency rate was down 2 basis points to 68 basis points. The year-over-year decrease in the personal loan charge-off rate was primarily driven by loan growth.","Next, I\u2019ll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our Tier 1 common ratio increased sequentially by 60 basis points to 14.9%. This despite the flowing $400 million of capital through buybacks and dividends. As was previously announced on March 26, we received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our proposed capital action during the four quarters that will end of March 31 of next year.","We were pleased with the outcomes in how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our capital ratios in the stress scenarios. Additionally, our board authorized a two-year $3.2 billion share repurchase program and last week increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.20 to $0.24 per share.","Now that we\u2019ve completed our inaugural CCAR stress test, we\u2019re updating our Basel III Tier 1 common target to approximately 11%. Our prior Tier 1 common target was largely grounded in our economic capital framework. The new target is based on an analysis of our CCAR stress test result, which similar to other large banks has become our binding constraint.","Just to remind you, this is largely an academic exercise at this point as we\u2019re well above our revised target and the current CCAR framework Discover just payouts greater than 100% of earnings.","In summary, this was a solid start to the year. We once again drove better than industry receivables growth. Net interest margin and credit remained strong. And we increased our planned capital deployment.","That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator, Ellen, to open things up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We ask that you please limit yourself to one initial and one follow-up question. The first question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi Mark, good evening.","Mark Graf","Hi Ryan.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So, just on the decision to change the Tier 1 common target to 11%. Can you just give us some context towards how you came up with the decision? This is obviously just your first year going through the CCAR, and I would have thought just given the experience that a lot of others have had that they taken a multiyear process before making a final decision in terms of the Tier 1 common target. So should we think about this as a potential to be a moving target over time, or you think this is something that will be more static and you\u2019ll continue to run within the longer term?","Mark Graf","No, I think Ryan, it\u2019s a great question. I think it\u2019s definitely going to be a moving target over time, not something I would see as static. I think we had historically had prior guidance out there that was based on our economic capital framework that we withdrew after last year\u2019s CCAR results when we saw how other card players had performed, and we just said it looks to us like maybe in the current environment, the number might be a little bit higher. And we need to wait and see, because the new binding constraint will be the stress test results themselves.","And I think the 11% number we\u2019re putting out to you today is really meant to be reflective of just that. The current environment and where things stand right now. I think it\u2019s intended to be dynamic. It should be dynamic. It should be driven by the mix of business, the business climate, the environment, lots of different things. So I would not assume it\u2019s a static 11%.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. And then given that you\u2019re still sitting here with over roughly 400 basis points of excess capital, above and beyond that level, and given the fact that it appears that the payout ratio will be south of 100% this time, it looks like you\u2019re going to probably continue to accrete capital from here. So just given that framework, is there any chatters overall across the industry potentially with the regulators about the ability to increase your capital of returns above 100%. And if so \u2013 if you were able to do so, what would be the method of preference would it be for incremental buyback or would you potentially think about something such as special dividend?","Mark Graf","I\u2019ll refer to the regulars, the fed, in terms of what they\u2019re thinking about in terms of the payout ratios over the long haul. I mean there is always speculation in industry from time to time. And I hear some of that on my peers. I am sure you\u2019re hearing a lot of around the horn too, but I\u2019ll defer to them over as to what their thought process is.","I think the CCAR process itself is designed to be a horizontal review. And at such point in time as the regulator is being capital to be rebuild in the industry, it would be our clear hope that the process could change somewhat in that regard, but at this point in time, the rules that we understand them still are kind of what we\u2019ve laid out there and that is that payout is greater than 100% are really discouraged in the current framework.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And I might squeeze in one last one, just on the updated forfeiture costs. Is this something that we should think of as being one-time in nature, i.e. the 7 basis points is one-time. And how do we think about in the context of 1% targeted reward rate that you\u2019ve talked about in the full year?","Mark Graf","Yes, great question. I would say the forfeiture rates re-impairment test or we cast that forfeiture assumption is a better way to describe it every six months, Ryan. And what we\u2019ve seen is in particular some of the popularity, the Pay with Cashback Bonus at Amazon and a few other features like that have driven a much higher propensity to utilize the cash back rewards. So we\u2019re not seeing as much forfeiture.","In addition to that, the really high quality credit environment right now is meaning folks aren\u2019t forfeiting their cash back balances due to delinquency. So when we looked at that, there was basically a catch-up adjustment we made to reflect those things. So I would say yes. I view them as one-time in nature.","Now again six months out, we\u2019ll look at them again but I don\u2019t \u2013 a crystal ball doesn\u2019t say some other giant adjustment six months from now as we sit here today. What I would say is that in terms of the 100% full year total rewards, Ryan, I would say yes, that still feels like about the right general ZIP code for where we\u2019re standing, maybe two or three basis points above or below that number somewhere in that generally is good. It\u2019s the way I think about the full year. So yes, I\u2019ll stand behind that one.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks for taking my questions.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","The next question is from Mark\u00a0DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark\u00a0DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes, thanks. First question is just a follow-up on Ryan\u2019s first question. Mark, is the \u2013 I believe it was the 9.5% economic capital you have. Is that still longer term where you would hope that the standard will converge on when instead sorts of get a little bit less conservative as far as what they want relative to what they\u2019ve kind of the theoretical goal posts are?","Mark Graf","Yes, the 9.5% we withdrew about a year ago. And yes, that was based on the economic capital, that\u2019s correct. I would say, look, based on an analysis of our economic capital position, it still strikes us that that would be reasonable place to operate the company over the long haul. I would say that process is obviously at this point in time, includes the federal reserve in the process. And they have a process that has imposed the binding constraint we have got today. And I want to be respectful of their role, the tough job they\u2019ve got to play in rebuilding capital in the system post the crisis and everything else. So I think it\u2019s a tough job and the horizontal review process is not easy for them. They\u2019ve got to do it under Dodd-Frank. It\u2019s not an option.","So again our hope would be overtime as capitals rebuild, the process will liberalize a little bit. I think it\u2019s here to stay, but we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll be able to liberalize. And that 9.5% economic capital numbers still doesn\u2019t feel entire wrong to us.","Mark\u00a0DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on a separate note, my sense was from the Investor Day that you\u2019re still giving really good response to the offers you\u2019re spending on the Discovery card. I think you also alluded to a benefit to the yield from some of the higher propensity to revolve. If you get a continued increase in that propensity to revolve along with strong response rates, could we see card loan growth in excess of the kind of 5% high end of your targeted range?","David Nelms","Well, as I mentioned Mark, we have achieved double-digit new account growth in the first quarter of this year compared to a year ago. So we\u2019re continuing to see good responses. And I would say that the pickup that we saw in year-over-year growth from around 3% to between 4% and 5%, I think already reflects that success. And so we are very focused on trying to put in additional things that will help keep us near the high-end of that 2% to 5% range. And I am just really pleased that we achieved that high-end this quarter.","Mark\u00a0DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, great. Thanks for your comments.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thank you. Mark, I was hoping that you could talk about the dynamics that we\u2019re currently seeing in consensus expectations which have your provision expense increasing 58% between 2013 and 2015, where your loan is only growing by 9% over that timeframe. Is it reasonable for growth in your provision line to outpace your loan growth by that much, particularly given that the reserve building that you\u2019ve been doing has been growth-driven, and in this quarter you actually had another release? As we look ahead, how should we be thinking about the pace of reserve building in relation to your loan growth?","Mark Graf","Yes, I would say there is lot in that one Bill. I\u2019ll try and hit it all. If I don\u2019t, feel free to come back at me on some pieces if I miss it. I guess what I would say as with respect to how consensus were looking at, I\u2019ll defer on that one because that\u2019s obviously how you guys were looking at it. So you probably have a better sense on that one than I do.","I guess what I would say is that the crystal ball right now gives us pretty good visibility into the 12-month forward loss emergence period. In that window, we do not see any type of deterioration in the consumer credit markets in which we play at this point in time. The environment continues to be very benign. We\u2019d expect provisioning to be largely a function of growth going forward, to the extent that there is adds to the provisions, to the extent there is releases, we\u2019d expect them to be from continued surprises to the good.","This most recent quarter both our contractual and our bankruptcy loss assessments in our modeling improved. And I think that affected both, not only the number of accounts but also the average balances. So I mean it\u2019s pretty broad-based improvement we saw across the board. So relative to the $1.6 billion in allowance or so that we\u2019ve got on the books, a modest relief, a modest bill as I kind of view it as variability around a flat reserve more or less over the course of the last quarter or two, but I don\u2019t see anything over the course of the next 12 months beyond growth in loans that would be a sizable driver of provision expense.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","So to the extent that maybe you had a little bit lower recoveries that could be something that contributes to the provisioning maybe exceeding loan growth a bit, but by and large, provision growth should roughly be similar to loan growth. Is that reasonable to expect at least for the next year?","Mark Graf","Yes, I mean I think I got to be little careful with that one because obviously the provision growth can be driven by one, our model shell. And those models get updated every quarter. But I would say as a general process, I think the framework we\u2019re thinking about and you\u2019re expressing is not a bad one.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay, great. And then separately there is a follow-up. There has been some commentary during this quarter\u2019s earnings calls suggesting that there are issuers out there who are willing to raise rewards to levels that are basically wiping out any interchange revenues that they generate. I wondered if you could comment on the extent to which you\u2019re seeing any competitive pressure from these types of aggressive reward campaigns. And maybe more broadly, if you guys could talk about how sustainable these elevated rewards are that we\u2019re seeing today across the industry, particularly some of the relatively high cash back rewards offers that are out there?","David Nelms","Well, I think that there is \u2013 we\u2019ve seen over many years where letters with come in with high rewards and then we\u2019ll pair them back. So I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s very different. And I think you kind of see people coming and rotate in and out. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t characterize now it\u2019s having an unusual number of people coming in with our rewards costs. I think some people are getting more aggressing and some people are backing off because they are running the numbers from last year\u2019s programs.","I think if you look at what we\u2019re doing apart from the sort of one-time adjustment, we still were just under 100 basis points. We\u2019ve been around a 100 points for a while. That was sufficient to drive industry leading growth. In receivables and growth in revenue, actually an expansion in net interest margin. So we are very focused on growing total profitability and profitable loans, not just short-term drilling rewards expenses out.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","It\u2019s very helpful. And if I may just a last one very quickly. What kind of ROE does your 11% common equity Tier 1 target represent? And then that\u2019s it. Thank you.","Mark Graf","Yes, I\u2019d say we haven\u2019t specifically translated that one publicly before, but certainly well north of that 15% number that is sort of our threshold level we put out there on our guidance previously.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thanks.","Mark Graf","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good evening guys.","David Nelms","Hi David.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I was looking at your expenses, it seem pretty clean this quarter outside some seasonal prime marketing and maybe a little bit of Diners cost. If I annualize that run rate, I would still get maybe three-ones. If I had a little bit of marketing, still relatively large delta versus your $3.3 billion, end of your target. I know you\u2019re building in some compliance regulatory costs and maybe some technology investments. How much are those in the run rate and then kind of what\u2019s the timing on that throughout the course of the year?","Mark Graf","Yes, I would say it\u2019s going to ebb and flow David a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I think I\u2019d probably point you back to the Investor Day commentary where I kind of said $3.3 million sort of felt like the right number for full year expenses. I would say \u2013 and based on everything I know right now, I wouldn\u2019t revise that guidance. If you were in Investor Day today, I\u2019ve still pretty much think that\u2019s held pretty good.","I think we feel pretty strongly that the last two quarters we\u2019ve slipped to flat to positive operating leverage with revenue growth in line with or exceeding our expense growth, which feels very good to us. We\u2019ve remained committed to consistently delivering positive operating leverage and that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re headed.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So another one on loan growth. It seems like some competitors are increasing credit lines or adjusting those for some of their customers. Is that something you guys have relatively been stable in your credit line you would have increases but that\u2019s something that you get use as a lever for loan growth going forward?","David Nelms","I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on that. Right after the crisis, we curtailed a lot of line increases, but at this point we restore things and we\u2019re a couple of years into a fairly stable situation of raising lines when appropriate.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And one more on the CCAR results for the loss rates. It seems like 15%, obviously the high end of the industry but versus your internal projections, was there a large delta there, and can you comment on the different [ph].","David Nelms","So I think David you can see our \u2013 we published our forecast for the losses and the supervisory stress scenario on I think it was March 26. So you can see the differences there. We can\u2019t explain the differences between the two, because there is not really that much insight that\u2019s given to how the fed comes up with their loss estimates.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks for taking the questions.","David Nelms","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Sanjay\u00a0Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay\u00a0Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Thank you. I guess I got one on capital and one on the network business. Just assuming the bulk of the excess capital is trapped, how aggressively are you looking for alternative uses? And I guess secondly on the network business, I guess intra-quarter we found out who the third-party issuing client was that left. Could you just talk about the prospects for that third-party business and broadly the \u2013 I am sorry the third-party issuing business and maybe the third-party segment broadly as well? Thank you.","Mark Graf","Yes, I\u2019ll tackle how aggressively part and then I\u2019ll pass it to David to talk about the network piece. I would say Sanjay, we are always actively looking for ways for capital to work to the benefit of our shareholders. So you should I think see if we assume we are always scanning a horizon for ways to do just that.","I think organically we\u2019re already outgrowing our key competitors out there in all of our core product lines and it feels like we\u2019re doing very good job of that. I\u2019d say when it comes to the inorganic opportunities in that front too, we\u2019re also always very actively scanning and looking for the right opportunities, balancing that against wanting to make sure that the capital doesn\u2019t burn a hole on our pocket so to speak. And I think the phrase I\u2019ve used before is if a deal doesn\u2019t make sense, we won\u2019t try to make it to make sense.","And I think there is things shown around on the streets from time to time, but there is disconnect between value in buyers mind from sellers minds. And I am not going to do something that doesn\u2019t make sense for my shareholders just to do it. So but rest assured, we clearly understand, we have more capital sitting around than our shareholders would like us to. We remain committed to our prioritization which would be organic redeployment, returning it and inorganic redeployment in that order. And we are going to stay diligently focused on that.","David Nelms","And Sanjay, obviously they want to bring that \u2013 represented the lion\u2019s shares and network partners volume of profits, but was an immaterial benefit before our currently paid EPS overall. But frankly, we had to look at the renewal and the renewal structure simply didn\u2019t meet our profit hurdles. So it would have gone from positive to a negative. And so that obviously didn\u2019t make sense for our shareholders.","If you look at where we\u2019ve been focused in the last couple of years, it\u2019s actually been not on deals like that but on non-traditional deals. So I point you to the various network-to-network deals. The various deals like the Ariba, PayPal and others with some other emerging partners, and as well as continuing the focus on debit where we\u2019ve got a strong market position in terms of market share.","And so we\u2019re pretty pleased with the deals there, but it takes a while for volumes to profits of new deals to take the place. That\u2019s something that\u2019s much more maturity of going to going away later this year.","Sanjay\u00a0Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","And one follow-up if I may to Mark\u2019s comments. Just in terms of places where you\u2019re looking at where the prices might not make sense. I mean could you just talk about what those areas are? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Mark Graf","Sure. I guess, Sanjay, the way I think about it as you were talking the balance sheet business, you\u2019re looking at assets that are consumer-oriented assets in nature, assets that are actuarially I would say for lack of a better term underwritten and managed as opposed to big lumpy exposures. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see us run out and start doing C&I lending or commercial real estate lending next quarter. I think I would stick to more granular consumer or consumer-like type portfolios would be the way I think about that.","And obviously I think my earlier comment, I think our crystal ball shows an ability for us to keep driving great ROEs right now as we look forward. And rushing out and trying to make one of those work, when it\u2019s not the right strategic fit and\/or the pricing isn\u2019t right in this environment. I think we want to be responsible stewards of our shareholders capital, and we\u2019re going to do the right things.","Sanjay\u00a0Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Great. Thank you.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","The next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup","Yes, David. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about spend during the quarter and into April, and then also briefly on the CFPB if there is anything going on there, or is it fairly stable?","David Nelms","Well, on spend volume, we have seen some pick up in the last several weeks. And I think we\u2019re going to have to see some more data points to see if that\u2019s sustained or not, but at least maybe as the weather finally gets a little bit better, that is potentially helping.","In terms of CFPB, there is really nothing new. I mean there is always reviews, there is the one \u2013 we\u2019ve continued to maintain a good working relationship. The one matter that we disclosed that we\u2019re still working already through. We don\u2019t really know exactly where that will come out, but we look forward to resolving that as soon as we can. We\u2019ll let you know as soon as there is more that we can say.","Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Brad Ball with EverCore. Please go ahead.","Brad Ball \u2013 EverCore Partners","Hi, yes, Mark, really two questions on the margin. One, sort of over the nearer term. Is there room for further funding cost benefits as you continue to drive more direct consumer in affinity deposits. And drives the margin even higher. And then secondly longer term, what is it that keeps you locked on your long-term margin guidance which I think is 8.5% to 9%. What gets us back down to that level? Is it higher funding costs, or is it competition, depleting asset yields. How do you foresee? I know you can\u2019t really give us timing, but how do you foresee getting to that lower level?","Mark Graf","I appreciate your addition of the timing point there. I appreciate that, very nice, but I am happy to tackle it. I guess I would say in the near-term, Brad, what we\u2019re doing is two different things. We\u2019re capturing and taking advantage of refinancing, albeit lesser volumes, but still not immaterial volumes of fundings. They were put on place several years back. Refinancing those at current lower rate in today\u2019s environment.","What we\u2019re also doing now is we\u2019ve begun to really extend out the duration and the maturities of that funding. So for example, we did about $400 million with a 12-year bank notes in March at a very attractive fixed coupon. So some of what we\u2019re doing will actually benefit margins. So what we\u2019re doing will actually modestly take away from that benefit to margin.","On balance in the near-term, is there is some potential modest upside in the margin? Yes, there is some potential modest upside in the margin, yes, in the near-term I would say. But we\u2019re not letting \u2013 it would be greater for a lack of a better way of saying and if we weren\u2019t positioning ourselves what to perform well in all environments. So from an asset liability perspective, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re not being pigs at the trough and just taking advantage of it all today, but there is opportunities with some more expansion there.","In terms of longer term guidance, I think there is any number of things, credit normalization, increased interest rates. At some point in time even if we\u2019re extending out the duration of maturities of the funding, if and when that matures in a higher rate environment. I would say the biggest reason though is if I\u2019ve kept that guidance and we\u2019ve not been comfortable moving of it is \u2013 David has been pretty clear about our goals to become the leading direct consumer bank in the country.","And I think part of what comes with that is diversification. And the other consumer asset classes we\u2019re not playing in today have lower yields than several of the ones we are playing in today. The good news is they also have lower loss rates. So on a risk-adjusted basis the returns they drive are very, very similar but they would \u2013 that further expansion would be diluted to margins. So that\u2019s the biggest reason we\u2019ve kept it in tact.","Brad Ball \u2013 EverCore Partners","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then my one quick follow-up is on the Diners expense this quarter. Are we getting to the tail-end of that incremental Diners cost in Europe, or are we looking at that likely to continue over the next few quarters?","Mark Graf","I would say you should expect it will continue over the next couple of quarters. It\u2019s really being driven by the business we acquired in Europe, the Italian Diners franchisee and the processor related there too. I am not so sure I would take that number and make that number a run rate. I\u2019d give you that guidance, but I would also expect there will be some drive that comes with that business for the foreseeable future.","Brad Ball \u2013 EverCore Partners","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Craig\u00a0Maurer with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Craig\u00a0Maurer \u2013 CLSA","Yes, hi. Would it be correct to assume that if you\u2019re seeing increased spend volume over the last few weeks as the weather improved that\u2019s coming with increased demand for lending or accelerating of loan growth? And secondly, with respect to PayPal, and assuming that they are yet to show any understanding of what a value proposition would need to be at a physical point of sale, would it be fair to characterize that your belief in their growth is now switched to a hope for growth?","David Nelms","Well, I think on the second one you need to talk to PayPal. I wouldn\u2019t comment. We value PayPal as a partner. We still are very optimistic in the long-term, but what I would say is that, they are going to continue to test and learn and develop and where we exactly start and where we exactly end. As you would expect its marks [ph] will change. And you are seeing that with all the other players in the space as well whether it\u2019s Amazon or Google or Apple or they\u2019re all changing as time goes past.","In terms of the first question\u2026","Mark Graf","Sales outlook [ph].","David Nelms","I would say we already feel really good about our loan growth accelerating to nearly 5% this quarter. If I can keep it at that level, I\u2019d be thrilled. I would not get ahead of myself and say, it\u2019s going to necessarily accelerate from here. I\u2019d love to see a little more acceleration in our sales growth. And while I feel really good about it if we continue to see a little pick up in retail sales more broadly in the economy. And maybe that our sales and our balance growth move closer to being in line versus sales be in a little bit [indiscernible].","Craig\u00a0Maurer \u2013 CLSA","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. Couple of questions. One was follow-up to the NIM discussion. I know you\u2019ve had high APR balances and have been trading down but very, very slowly. So I was just wondering, A, what\u2019s driving. Why did this slow and then B, are you assuming your normalized NIM outlook that \u2013 or your long-term NIM outlook, I should say that those high ARP balances have already traded?","Mark Graf","Yes, so Betsy, if you look at the higher rates buckets, it\u2019s down to somewhere on the nature, I may have it little wrong but I am really close. I think about 16% of the total above give or take, somewhere in that and I think it\u2019s maybe 15%.","A big chunk of that is cash advance balances, the rate on which is not covered or regulated on the CARD Act. So the amount of high rate balances left to a trade is relatively modest, and I\u2019d be honest in telling you that the bucket is getting replenished somewhere near about as fast as to trading. So it seems to be approaching a point of stability. It will decline from here a little bit more, but relative stability in that regard.","So I think the high rate balances that are trading are not having the same including the factors that we were fighting here a year or two ago.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Because it\u2019s [indiscernible].","Mark Graf","Yes, exactly right. So it feels like we\u2019re approaching a point of state to spare at least for now. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re all the way there yet necessarily, but it feels like we\u2019re getting somewhere close to that. And I apologize, I\u2019ve forgotten second part of the question.","David Nelms","Our long-term loans targets, do we assume more run-off?","Mark Graf","The long-term target, do we assume more run-off. Now the same thing. It\u2019s basically just assumes we\u2019re reaching a point of spaces there more or less, but it projects that there will be some continued run-off from here.","Yes, I mean it\u2019s again that longer term NIM target is really driven by the mix shift that we anticipate seeing overtime as we broaden the base of assets.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And so consumers already shouldn\u2019t have product and grows as they seek that type of financing and it can go up as well. So that\u2019s not on your base case.","Mark Graf","Correct.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then second question just on the other income line. Could you help us understand how is that mortgage-related revenues and could you speak to the thought process around portfolio-ing mortgages and is there an acceleration time?","Mark Graf","Sure. I would say with respect to the portfolio-ing of mortgages, I would say I don\u2019t see that any time in the near-term in our current business plans. I think our cost of capital is in the particularly efficient place to hold a market price asset shall we say of that within a spread. So we probably aren\u2019t the most efficient holder for portfolio mortgages.","We do from time to time contemplate with every service RM [ph] product. They\u2019ll read that as me telegraphing or going into servicing next week by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s just something we do consider to control the customer experience. I think we\u2019re very proud of the customer service we provide. And our ability to keep driving that forward is something that\u2019s very important to us.","With respect to the decrease in other income and how much of it is related to the mortgage business. I was in the mortgage business is the biggest single component of that decrease in other income.","David Nelms","Year-over-year.","Mark Graf","Yes, year-over-year. And it\u2019s about probably plus or minus, let\u2019s call it between $30 million and $40 million year-over-year decline in that line item that\u2019s driven by the mortgage business. So as I\u2019ve kind of guided and as David guided you all to historically I would say, we bought the business because we wanted to be in the asset class. We purposely got it small. So in the good days maybe we were creating a penny or so a share to income overtime on a quarterly basis.","And maybe today, we\u2019re taking away penny a quarter per share give or take something like that. So it\u2019s not really a material driver of the earnings stream today and feels like a place we want to be playing some type of a role as part of our goal to become that leading direct consumer bank, but growing it before we figured out the right formula for it doesn\u2019t make sense.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So that too is kind of steady state in terms of seeing adjustment that you want to make there?","Mark Graf","Yes, I think if we saw the right opportunity to penetrate more deeply to purchase mortgage market I think as team, we\u2019d be prepared to make the investments for the right opportunities. But I think again in this environment, we need to see the clear path of doing that. We\u2019re not going to just throw money at it to see if it works. We have to see a clear path of that being a good investment decision.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hi good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on the marketing side. As I look at the last three quarters, you\u2019re basically flat year-on-year with marketing expense, and this is at the same time if you\u2019re launching some new products. So I am wondering, has there been some shift in your marketing spend either call it class marketing versus branding or maybe some shift in the channels where you\u2019re advertising that you\u2019re finding more efficient place to do your marketing like internet versus direct mail? Just curious on how you\u2019re keeping your marketing so steady year-on-year?","David Nelms","Well, we\u2019re certainly trying to be efficient with our marketing. And in terms of the first part of your question, I mean we\u2019ve kind of had a series of new products. I mean we launched, Discover it, last year. We recently added free FICO Scores on statements. We\u2019re continuing to have maybe you wouldn\u2019t call them total new product launches, but significant product development and that are newsworthy, and frankly that\u2019s one of the reasons that our ad dollars and our marketing dollars go further because we have real news to tell consumers subscribe their name.","And we\u2019re going to continue to do that. At the same time we are getting better and better at internet and a direct digital marketing. And you\u2019re seeing us do more and more in that space a very high percentage around new applications are coming there. And we\u2019re continuing to fine tune I mentioned the new application that is having a better click-through and completion rates. So we continue to try to take steps to make our marketing dollars go further.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And then\u2026","Mark Graf","One thing I would like to add just to make sure we\u2019re all levels, that is, if we saw the right opportunities that we\u2019re going to drive the right kind of returns, this is a team that will invest if we had the right opportunities, right. And I think certain of our competitors have basically pulled way back on marketing spend and that\u2019s probably \u2013 unless we saw diminishing returns from it, not somewhere we\u2019d be right now.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And then just shifting gears. So something else that had been disclosed in your 10-K about the FDIC notification about potential program efficiencies on AML, BSL, if there is just any updates there or anything to say?","David Nelms","No, there is not an update. We\u2019re continuing much as I mentioned with the CFPB. They have a very collaborative working relationship and we\u2019ll let you know more if and when we get to the point where we can reach closure and let you know how things turn out.","Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hi good evening guys.","David Nelms","Hi Brian.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","I guess just on \u2013 most of my questions have been asked, but maybe on deposits. Can you remind us kind of as we been flat for a while, how much of that is just using to legacy higher rates stuff go versus how much of that is increased competition in the marketplace?","David Nelms","I\u2019d say it\u2019s all the former from our perspective. Well we have been reasonable stable after a period of very rapid growth, within that when we talked about some in Investor Day, we\u2019ve significantly remixed and have carefully gone through the portfolio and have been maybe less aggressive on pricing and more aggressive on the most profitable parts of that to position ourselves for rising rate environment to make sure we\u2019re with core customers.","But one of the most important factors is that its heavily cross-sell. And I think last year, about 50% of that total book has actually came from cross-sell as opposed to new customers to the franchise. Last year was about 70% cross-sell. And so we think that turning this into really all core deposits is very important.","I think going forward, the big thing is checking account. That\u2019s not going to change the mix dramatically or add to balances dramatically in the near-term, but in the long-term that is very strategic for us because that is fairly relationship driven, and we think we have a very differentiated product with no fees, rewards and mobile capabilities that are unmatched. But if these are sticky, it will take time but that in the long-term is where we\u2019d love to see some growth.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","And just maybe one follow-up. There is a separate question. I feel like I\u2019m asking something that\u2019s already been asked, but just as I look through these loan yields, I keep waiting for the mix shift in competition to bring them down, and it\u2019s the only thing that keep going up. So you kind of touched on how couple of different things happening in different corners [ph] but were you surprised by how well the loan yields evolved, how to adopt this cycle and is there anything identifiable in the near-term that would change that?","David Nelms","Well, remember there is an interaction with loan losses. And so loan credit losses means we were charged-off interest. And so to some degree a new normal in credit will be a new normal resulting some new normal in NIM. The second thing I would point out is that things are a bit different from card \u2013 as a result of CARD Act.","And as you know, one of the key attributes of CARD Act is you really can\u2019t change, and I think change rates down the road. And so I think people maybe are a little more careful about going in with too low of a rate upfront. And so it\u2019s keeping their competition much more disciplined. And maybe in past cycles there might have been rate decreases now, but once you decrease you can never go back up.","And so I think that is keeping a certain amount of discipline in the marketplace. And I think that would be here to stay.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thank you, good afternoon. I just want to clarify, I think you said that the new accounts in credit cards were up 10% year-over-year. Is that right?","Mark Graf","I said double-digits.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Double-digit\u2026","Mark Graf","I didn\u2019t say the exact percentage.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Okay. And then maybe what drove when you had flat marketing as was earlier pointed out, what drove the double-digit? And is the Discover it at all changing the demographics of the customer base. So what\u2019s driving that growth? Is it continuing? Is it sustainable, and is that product changing the demographics of Discover customers somewhat?","David Nelms","Well, I would point back to my earlier comments about getting incremental improvements in our marketing effectiveness in the digital space as well as the introduction of the free FICO Scores, which is resonating well, as well as our great service. And I think we\u2019re doing a better and better job with getting the word out that we have a fantastic service.","I think that we\u2019re seeing on balance a slightly younger attraction. And I think that would be consistent with being digital kind of focus. And frankly people that are a bit younger probably have greater appeal to the free FICO Scores because they may still be building their \u2013 their credit scores aren\u2019t as locked in after decades of behaviors. And that we\u2019re pleased with making our money go a bit further.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","And then on your redemption rate, I guess are taking the charge this quarter. I think the American Express has given out numbers. They are probably in the mid 90s on the redemption rate. What is the redemption rate for Discover? Is it similar to American Express? Is it much lower?","Mark Graf","We\u2019re looking at each other across the table right now. I\u2019m not sure we probably disclose that one. What I would say is our goal would be to make sure our customers have the opportunity to avail themselves that Cashback Bonus to the greatest extent possible. I mean we are \u2013 we take actions on a regular basis like that they would Cashback Bonus at Amazon and other features to try and make that redemption very easy for the customer.","We found it\u2019s driven dramatically increased engagement on the part of our customers. If you look at the receivables growth we\u2019ve had vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, A, it\u2019s pretty significant and I think there is a reason they are choosing to build those receivables with us. And I would say if you looked at the components of that 5% receivables growth, when you look at the first quarter, basically all that growth was standard merchandize sales, all right. I mean there was not a significant amount of VT [ph] in the component. There was not a significant amount of promotional merchant component.","It\u2019s basically standard merchandize. We\u2019re getting to see old-fashioned way and that\u2019s the best most profitable time. So it feels really good.","David Nelms","It is in that general ZIP codes. And it\u2019s been hard for quite sometime and that\u2019s partly how we designed it. It\u2019s cash. It\u2019s not points. We tried to have \u2013 make it \u2013 as a competitive advantage make it easier to redeem. We tried to have minimal brokerage. What we see as the payback is not in the brokerage but in increased usage. And so it\u2019s a high percentage.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","And then on the last question \u2013 last question if I could sneak in on the leading direct consumer bank focus. Is there a \u2013 to accelerate the view, I mean you\u2019re trading at 11x earnings. It\u2019s been a great stock and earnings have gone up. And I\u2019m sure investors aren\u2019t complaining about the stock, but mid-regional banks are putting it 15x earnings. And you\u2019re really in a sweet spot of banking, I mean people are closing branches, not opening branches and you have a good brand and position. Is there a way to accelerate that view, I mean to grow the checking, the deposit? Is there some M&A that possibly would bid with your franchise that maybe accelerate the checking account, the growth of checking accounts or other products for Discover?","David Nelms","Well, I think checking in particular, I am not sure who one would acquire because I think we\u2019re with the leading edge there. Arguably I think there are some that have done a good job, USAA is one I would point to, because they\u2019re with a more focused customer base, but they\u2019ve done a great job on service and actually getting people to use out as their checking \u2013 having the primary checking account.","But there is \u2013 I think generally we would consider other ways to accelerate our growth, but there is not a lot of direct players out there in any of our asset classes that one would think about being able to acquire. I mean student loans can certainly fit that criteria a few years ago and you saw us take action. So we have done things to accelerate were appropriate, and we always looked, but we would have to make sure it was something that did the strategy.","Most of what would be out there would be branch banks which isn\u2019t as you said direct banking.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thank you very much.","David Nelms","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Sameer\u00a0Gokhale with Janney Capital. Please go ahead.","Sameer\u00a0Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to start off, I am trying to just go back to your commentary, Mark, about the loss reserves and where they should be expected to trend and then also the provisions. And I am trying to just frame this in my mind, get to help you better quantify the thinking around provisioning would be related to growth, but if I look at your \u2013 I go back of Q1 of 2012, I annualize your charge-off, say in the credit card business and then I subtract from that what you had in reserves associated with the card portfolio and divide that by the average loan balance in that portfolio. There is a gap of about \u2013 it comes out to me, the math looks that we were 100 basis points and I call that cushion if you will for lack of a better word. And then if you look at the same calculation of Q1 of 2013, that was about 60, 62 basis points. And then in the most recent quarter about 32 basis points. So am I correct in just running that calculation thinking that, okay, if were to use the term cushion for lack of a better word, the cushion is thinner now clearly as you\u2019ve gone down reserves and that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to be having more provision related to growth as opposed to having any additional opportunities to release reserves? Is that the right way of thinking about it?","Mark Graf","No. I wouldn\u2019t think about in terms of that cushion \u2013 in terms of that thought process. I mean we don\u2019t \u2013 GAAP doesn\u2019t allow you to keep cushion per se. GAAP basically requires you to be pretty darn transparent about where you think losses are actually trending. And I can promise you there are regulators from multiple different regulatory bodies and external auditor who crawls all over those loss reserve models on a regular basis.","So I wouldn\u2019t think about it in terms of there being some cushion put in there. I think, Sameer, in terms of where that trending goes from here, I would say loan growth is going to cause \u2013 you mean the components of it, what I can\u2019t do is tell you every quarter exactly how they are going to swing. But the components that we process do have to have a positive provisioning would be at least in the near-term those that are related to loan growth, growth in the balance sheet, growth in assets, because we don\u2019t see any significant turn in the overall environment for credit any time soon, okay.","Another factor that would cause positive provisioning would be the student loan business, right. Our organic student loan business only 36% of that at this point of time is in repayment. So as that portfolio continues to seize in, that one will be driving modest additions. I think the flat score of the student loans was $9 million with loan loss reserve addition, if you will in the total calculation something like that.","So those would be the two big factors that would cause positive provisioning. On the flip side of the equation, what in a stable credit environment or a nearly stable credit environment would cause you to have releases, I would say it would be for both bankruptcy and contractual accounts. What\u2019s our experience and hence our revised forecast based on that experience is for both, the average balances that will be impacted as well as the number of accounts that will be impacted.","So if you have a situation where you see average balances are going down and you have a situation where you see the number of accounts being impacted are going down, that obviously helps. So that would be the component parts and pieces of the puzzle. Last couple of quarters, we saw slight increase in some of those numbers. This quarter we saw a decrease. Hope that\u2019s helpful.","Sameer\u00a0Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital","That\u2019s helpful. I was looking only at your card business and I was just moving into baseline assumption that you have about 12 months of reserves of charge-offs in your reserves, and then looking at your run rate of charge-offs, I was trying to extrapolate from that, but you\u2019re color is very helpful. The other question is on a different note, your personal loan product, I mean clearly you\u2019ve had a lot of growth there. You\u2019ve been very successful. Now the other day in one of the newspapers, there was some discussion about a company called Lending Club, which seems to target prime customers specifically for purposes of refinancing on the higher cost credit card debt and other types of debt. I was curious, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve felt \u2013 I mean clearly, I mean portfolio is probably lot smaller than the card portfolio, but it seems like you\u2019re generating pretty healthy growth rates there, but do you come across this company? Do you \u2013 is it a different demographic from what you usually target, because it seems like the demographic was pretty similar. So I was just trying to reconcile your fast growth rates with the fact that there seem to be other competitors coming in specifically targeting that customer base?","David Nelms","Well, from what I can tell, I would say the P2P companies are probably the leading competitors to what we\u2019re doing. And so we certainly are taking notice. From what I can tell, some of them tend to be a little broader in their credits than we are. We are quite focused on prime, and as opposed to sort of full spectrum on lending, but nonetheless I think some of them were doing some interesting things.","And one of the things that we have done historically has been by invitation-only kind of marketing, and we are testing into this year at least considering the applications of people that are coming to us through the internet site from broad markets and may benefit from debt consolidation product. And that may bring us a little bit closer to some of the things that \u2013 space that they\u2019re in.","Sameer\u00a0Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful, David. And just one quick one, I\u2019ll sneak it in there just to make sure, I mean it doesn\u2019t sound to me like you\u2019re opposed to buying portfolios of private student loans, clearly Sallie Mae bank will be a stand-alone entity that said they want to sell roughly about half of their production would be $2 billion in loans. Is that something you\u2019d be interested in, or should we assume that for now unless you\u2019re got a really compelling price, you\u2019re just going to focus some more on the organic growth?","David Nelms","I mean I think if it was the portfolio \u2013 if the portfolio was available, we would simply run the numbers and decide if it was a good thing for shareholders and whether hurdles or not. I am not familiar with what Sallie may or may not do. I suspect that you\u2019re talking more about what they\u2019ll securitize versus keeping the balance sheet, which is probably something little different than buying whole loans but.","Sameer\u00a0Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital","I think these are probably the whole loan sales. They originated about $4 billion a year and they plan to sell $2 billion to one of their other entities that\u2019s being spun out, but presumably they could also offer these out to the open market for other bidders to bid for these loans. So I was just curious if you\u2019d be interested in that or even philosophically as you pointed out, you just want to focus on your organic business. It sounds like if the price is right, you might probably be interested?","David Nelms","Yes. Well, I would say the primary focus across all of our businesses is organic growth, and we\u2019re really pleased that we\u2019re achieving good organic growth. We would be open to things that fit the strategy and could accelerate that growth, but Sallie hasn\u2019t called me yet, so I couldn\u2019t comment on that specifically.","Sameer\u00a0Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital","All right. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from with Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rick Shane \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. If we look at sort of the backdrop on what\u2019s happened in mortgage, I think it\u2019s fair to say that \u2013 you called a tailwind in the beginning if you didn\u2019t probably necessarily drove profit building a little bit quicker. You called it headwind over the last couple of quarters and I think the expectation is once you turn profitable in that business, it would have been steadily profitable. Two questions here. One is, you talked about the revenues, can you talk about the expense controls that you\u2019ve seen associated with mortgages you\u2019ve seen a slowdown. And following that, do you believe at current run rates, which I think are probably a realistic expectation going forward that that business can at least be modestly profitable?","David Nelms","Well, I would say that you characterized it right. Things did better than expected in this way and a little worse than expected recently. I read somewhere that we\u2019re in a 17-year low on mortgage originations in total. And I am not sure I agree with your characterization is that business is steady, because it by nature tends to be cyclical. And I think we\u2019re in a particularly unusual tough cycle right at the moment.","I think that the direct part of that business has tended to be more refinance focused. So it tends to be even more cyclical. And so I think in our long-term view, what we want to do is generate more first mortgage production which will be more stable. During the quarter, you saw us make at least one announcement on relationships with realtors and search properties that would help actually generate direct first mortgage origination. And I think that\u2019s indicative of some of what we want to do over the long-term is move to that more stable production model.","We have also taken steps as everyone else has done to rationalize the excess capacity. In the industry, you have out to take expenses out. In the near-term, our objective is probably simply just to get back to breakeven. It\u2019s not costing us huge money right now but we do see a path to get to breakeven fairly quickly. And then after that the question is can we move it up to a long-term contributor. And then eventually to grow it to be in more substantial contributor.","Rick Shane \u2013 JPMorgan","Got it. Great. Thank you very much. Well actually can I circle back on that? Can you talk a little bit about how much of the costs \u2013 I mean you basically showed a 50% year-over-year compression of revenues. And again totally understandable given where we are in the cycle. What do you think on an apples-to-apples basis the expense ratios down there?","David Nelms","It\u2019s just not material unless to break out. As we\u2019ve said, we took cost down as well so that whole revenue didn\u2019t go up to the bottom line, but it was enough of a swing us from a modest profit to a modest loss. And I would just\u2026","Mark Graf","Yes. I would say, look, from my perspective the expense cut probably hasn\u2019t been as deep as the revenue loss just to be intellectually honest with you guys in here. I mean I think it needs to be one thing if we had a big stable business that was operating at giant scale. Yes, you take out all the expenses and you\u2019d be ready to rock and roll. We\u2019re actually trying to figure up what the right role for us in this business is and how to play it the right way.","So we\u2019re looking for opportunities to penetrate purchase money mortgage channel as David alluded to earlier a number of different things. So we\u2019re not going to cut to the bone, but by the same again if we\u2019re not going to be improving in terms of how we manage the business either, we\u2019re going to be smart about it, but we want to find a way to make this a contributing business that really adds value to our customer relationships going forward.","So yes, we\u2019ve taken a red pencil to it, but we are also not focused on just slashing it, we want to find a way to make it work.","David Nelms","One other thing I would add is that we have diverted some of the resources in that business into our new home equity product that we launched late last year. And I think we\u2019ve got some early months of optimizing the process and still want to be fully reviewed [ph] that you start to think about scaling that business, but that\u2019s a business that I think is going to tend to be countercyclical with the core mortgage business. And as rates rise and as home equity starts to recover, I think there is going to be some very nice growth. And in contrast, the mortgage business, that very much lends itself to direct marketing. There is lot of first mortgage, versus second \u2013 versus is refinancing issue. We think we can compete robustly for a large percentage of that market.","Rick Shane \u2013 JPMorgan","Terrific. Thank you guys.","David Nelms","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. David, you mentioned double-digit account growth with Discover \u2013 I guess overall double-digit account growth for credit cards. I am just wondering how that\u2019s progressed over time? You mentioned you launched some Discover it campaign about a year ago. Wonder if it\u2019s been consistent? If you\u2019ve seen acceleration in the pace of account additions?","David Nelms","Well, we had increased our accounts from when we launched Discover it. And we\u2019re now on the one year anniversary of really launching Discover it broadly. So when we talk about double-digit, that\u2019s lapping the increases that we have in the initial launch of Discover it.","Scott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay. And then just a follow-up question. You mentioned as more loans enter repayment, losses will go up in the student loan portfolio. Where do you see kind of \u2013 if you were to stabilize the portfolio, where would you see kind of losses over, say the lifetime of a loan percentage-wise?","David Nelms","Well, I think as we\u2019ve talked about a few years ago, well we project lifetime losses of somewhere around 10% roughly a 10-year life on average with prepayments. And so you\u2019d expect it to be a little bit north of 100 basis points, but as we described to you before, the first two years of repayment typically you see half of the total of lifetime losses occur as people have to start the repayment and there at the early part of their career, and therefore have the lowest income generally.","And so as people would expect, as we get more and more people that bubble going through the first two years of repayment, we would expect it to be well north of that 100 basis points and you\u2019re seeing that in our numbers. So it\u2019s tracking pretty much according to our expectations.","Scott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks very much.","Mark Graf","Thank you.","Operator","The final question comes from David\u00a0Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","David\u00a0Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Thanks. I just had two really short follow-up clarification questions. David mentioned before that the loss of the third-party issuing relationship would be immaterial. Was that immaterial to payment services income or to total company income, and when could that start to show up?","David Nelms","The total company income. Obviously the volumes and the profits on the much smaller base of the third-party payments business is the lion\u2019s share of the one that the third-party.","David\u00a0Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","All right. And do you have a sense of when the conversions would start?","David Nelms","We expect later this year.","David\u00a0Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay. And then you were saying the lion\u2019s share of the network partners volume?","David Nelms","Correct.","David\u00a0Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","All right. And payment services income has affected as well?","David Nelms","The payment services income also has PULSE and Diners contributing to it. Yes, if you remember that network partners is the third component with the smallest portion of volume.","David\u00a0Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Right. Thanks. And then just wonder if you could tell us how much lower you think protection products revenue can go? Are we getting close to trough do you think?","David Nelms","Well, we have not restored marketing. And so you\u2019re going to see continued attrition. It maybe trading a little bit slower than we might have anticipated. We\u2019re seeing some very nice loyalty and customers, and maybe that\u2019s inside the target reach, maybe helping because those securities attributes can be pretty valuable to people. But it\u2019s going to continue to trade until we restore marketing.","David\u00a0Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay. And then I don\u2019t know, I might have missed it, but Mark did you gave an estimate of what you think your Tier \u2013 your Basel III Tier 1 common ratio as of March 31?","Mark Graf","No, we didn\u2019t but it\u2019s only off by maybe 10 or 12 basis points from our current stated Tier 1 common equity level. So it does not \u2013 implementing Basel III does not have a material impact on us.","David\u00a0Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Thanks a lot.","David Nelms","Thank you, David.","Operator","That was the final question. Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Bill Franklin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you for joining us this evening.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference to Mr. Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Bill Franklin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Abigail. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report, and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the second quarter 2015 earnings materials we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated.","So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bill. Good evening everyone, and I want to thank you all for joining us today. For the second quarter we delivered net income of $599 million, earnings per share of $1.33, and a return on equity of 21%.","Our net income this quarter benefited from a reserve release driven by a better outlook for our card credit. Card net charge-off and delinquency rates improved, as card members continue to be careful about managing their debt. And we continue to take action to help them stay current. At the same time consumer conservatism and lower gas prices have resulted in slow U.S. retail sales growth, and this along with heightened competition, has resulted in a bit slower growth for our card sales and loans.","Despite these headwinds to sales we once again achieved another quarter of solid loan growth, building upon more than four years of quarterly card loan growth. Discover achieved total loan growth of 5% over the prior year, which was driven by growth in card loans, personal loans, and private student loans. Specifically we grew card receivables by 4%, in the middle of our targeted range. Card sales volume for the quarter was up 2%. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 5%.","Our loan growth continues to be driven by a combination of wallet share gains with new accounts and existing customers. Despite a competitive environment new account growth accelerated through the quarter, as we launched our double rewards offer to new Discover it customers.","In addition to launching new rewards promotions in the quarter we also introduced new features for our card members. For example we launched our Freeze It capability, which essentially allows customers to turn on or off their card in the event that it is misplaced. Over 100,000 customers have tried this feature since launch.","We also announced that our card members will be able to use Apple Pay and Android Pay in the near future. Our goal is to provide our customers the freedom, options, and simplicity of making mobile payments with whatever method they choose. Mobile payments and digital in all their forms will continue to be an opportunity to further engage with our card members, and we continue to invest in these capabilities.","Turning to other direct lending products, the organic student loan portfolio increased 19% and personal loans grew 13% over the prior year. Both are on track for record originations in 2015, as we launch additional marketing programs with student loans during peak season, and as we see increased personal loan applications from the broad market.","On the regulatory front this week the CFPB and the FDIC announced that they have released us from the protection products consent orders, which we entered into with them a few years ago.","This morning we announced a consent order with the CFPB regarding certain student loan servicing practices. You may remember that we had previously disclosed a CID related to this matter early last year. And we fully accrued for this in the first quarter of 2015.","Finally on the AML\/BSA and general compliance fronts, we have noted significant expenses this quarter related to our continuing focus on meeting all regulatory expectations from our regulators.","Focusing on payments, total volume was down 3% as increases in our proprietary volume and growth in our business-to-business volume were not enough to offset year-over-year declines at PULSE. The decreased volume at PULSE was mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a large debit issuer.","On a reported basis Diners volume was roughly flat. However adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange rates, Diners volume was up more than 10% year-over-year, driven by strong results in several regions, especially Asia Pacific.","Lastly, we rebalanced our portfolio of activities in the second quarter. In Direct Banking we announced the exit of our Home Loans business. In payments and specifically within Diners we announced the sale of our Diners Club Italy franchise to Corn\u00e8r's Bank (sic) [Corn\u00e8r Bank] (6:09) and announced a new Diners Club franchisee in Turkey. We are committed to our vision to be the leading direct bank and payments partner and continue to take steps towards achieving this vision.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he will walk through the details of our second quarter results.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, David, and good evening everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Total company net revenues this quarter were roughly flat on a year-over-year basis, as higher net interest income was offset by lower fee income. Net interest income increased $47 million or 3% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth. Total non-interest income decreased $44 million to $539 million, driven primarily by lower net discount and interchange revenue and a decline in protection products revenue.","Net discount and interchange revenue was down 9%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 105 basis points. On a reported basis, the rate was up 14 basis points year-over-year due to higher promotional rewards and the elimination of the rewards forfeiture reserve in the fourth quarter of 2014. Sequentially, the rate increased 3 basis points. In both cases, the increase was driven by higher enrollment and spend in our rotating 5% cashback category. Protection products revenue declined $10 million as new product sales remained suspended, consistent with prior quarters.","Moving to Payment Services, revenue decreased $9 million from the prior year due to the previously announced loss of volume from a large debit issuer, which David referenced earlier. This loss is now largely reflected in the run rate going forward and will impact year-over-year comparisons for the next year.","Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.35% was 7 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by a 6 basis point decrease in card yield. The year-over-year decrease in card yield reflects a small shift in portfolio mix as high rate balances continue to be replaced by standard rate balances. Personal loan yield decreased from the prior year as more customers opt for shorter term consolidation loans, and we also instituted some select pricing changes. Funding costs increased 9 basis points as a result of actions taken in prior quarters to extend funding duration. In aggregate, these factors resulted in a 21 basis point decrease in net interest margin from the prior year to 9.63%, in line with our expectations.","Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were up $130 million over the prior year, partially driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs. Employee compensation increased $25 million, due primarily to higher head count to support regulatory and compliance needs. Reported marketing expenses increased $31 million, $17 million of which was due to the discontinuation of a longstanding annual postage rebate that we typically received in the second quarter. Marketing expenses were also impacted by a shift in the timing of campaigns as compared to last year. Professional fees increased $41 million, due in part to approximately $20 million in fees associated with anti-money laundering remediation activities and another $10 million in compliance program enhancements.","Other expense increased $29 million, driven by $23 million in one-time charges associated with the exit of our Home Loans business. We expect additional wind-down in restructuring expenses of approximately $25 million to $30 million in the second half of the year, and we currently expect a fourth quarter tax benefit related to exiting the business that will essentially offset these additional expenses.","For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was 42.5%. Excluding the two unusual items I mentioned earlier, the total company efficiency ratio was roughly 40.5%. On an adjusted basis, this is higher than where we want to be in the long-term. With everything we now know, including the charges related to exiting Home Loans, the legal reserve that occurred in the first quarter, the loss of the postal rebate as well as a modest increase in our outlook for compliance-related costs, we expect our as-reported expenses to be approximately $3.6 billion for the full year versus our prior guidance of $3.5 billion. We continue to expect that operating expenses will decrease in 2016.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide eight, provision for loan losses was lower by $54 million compared to the prior year due to a reserve release partially offset by higher charge-offs. This quarter, we reduced reserves by $41 million while last year we had a $23 million reserve build for the same period. This quarter's release was driven by a better credit outlook as overall card member health continues to improve, in part driven by lower gas prices and higher household cash flows. The credit card net charge-off rate decreased by 12 basis points from the prior quarter and by 5 basis points year-over-year to 2.28%.","The 30-plus-day delinquency rate of 1.55% declined relative to both the prior quarter and the prior year, reaching a new record low. The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, decreased 28 basis points from the prior year as we continue to benefit from more efficient collection strategies as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 12 basis points to 1.78%. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.","Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 15 basis points from the prior year and the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 5 basis points to 71 basis points. The year-over-year increase in the personal loan charge-off rate was primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth. We had mentioned at our annual Financial Community Briefing in May that we were seeing the potential for credit to be better than we expected at the beginning of the year. We are now comfortable that the underlying financial health of our card members will indeed produce credit results better than we originally anticipated. While the book continues to season, we do expect our provision rate for the full year to be better than our prior expectations of 2.5% as the credit backdrop remains remarkably benign.","One last item I'll call out on the income statement is that we were able to recognize some tax benefits which reduced our effective tax rate to 36.4% for the quarter. Looking forward, there may be some minor fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we are able to favorably resolve other tax matters.","To close things out, I'll touch on our capital position on slide nine. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio decreased sequentially by 30 basis points to 14.4% due to loan growth and capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased $425 million of common shares.","In summary, the health of our card members continues to be strong, which will be a positive for our credit performance. This goodness will be largely offset on the expense line, which will be elevated as we continue to address regulatory matters and wind-down the mortgage business. The competitive environment continues to intensify while retail sales growth has been slower than expected. As the environment evolves, we will address both opportunities and risks that it presents with a continuing focus on driving long-term shareholder value.","That concludes our formal remarks, so I'll turn the call back to our operator, Abigail, to open the line up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. I appreciate that the spending volume you had said was constrained by about 300 basis points and that your margin is still under pressure but you've kind of put a 9.5% kind of floor there. Could you talk a little bit about what steps you're taking, given all of the expenses that are building this year, to kind of improve profitability? Or do we just \u2013 I mean is it just that we kind of have to wait for those factors to abate? Could you just discuss your thoughts there?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Moshe, this is David. Some of the actions that we're taking now are designed to position us well for the future, even in some cases sacrificing near-term profitability. So the preparation for a rising rate environment on the funding side is costing us a bit of net revenue right now, but we think it's the right thing to do for long-term earnings growth. The exit of the Home Loans business will help our efficiency ratio going forward, and certainly we didn't see a path to producing adequate profitability in that business. And some of the marketing changes and cash rewards investments that we're making now are designed to drive growth and return long-term profitability. So it's focusing on long-term shareholder value, as Mark mentioned.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Moshe, all I'd really tack on to that is a big pressure right now is obviously on the expense front and its regulatory expenses. They were significant in the quarter. They continue to be a pressure point. We're committed to a constructive relationship with our regulators and making sure that we are operating in accordance with their expectations, but right now that's clearly a drag on profitability.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. So just to follow up, and maybe I was just a little too general in the question, is there a way that you could identify the effects of things that you expect to either abate or turn around in 2016, you're talking about the expenses on some of these compliance, the wind-down of the mortgage, perhaps if you would consider the costs of kind of preparing for the rising rate environment? I mean would you \u2013 is there a way to do that?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so let's talk about a couple of those specifically, Moshe, to really hit on the \u2013 very pointedly on your question. I would say let's take a look at the expense growth of $130 million, right? So $23 million of that is related to the exit of the Home Loans business, non-recurring; $17 million of it is related to the postal rebate that we have historically received kind of going away. Right? So that takes me down to an adjusted number. Then take out another $8 million for EMV costs that we incurred in the quarter, give or take. It takes me down to an adjusted $82 million. There's about, call it, another $40 million in various and sundry different regulatory related costs that are in there. That gets me down to an adjusted \u2013 rough math now, mind you, but for the sake of the call here \u2013 an adjusted expense growth number of $42 million as opposed to the headline number of $130 million. Right? So I think that's kind of a key piece of the puzzle to look at.","If you talk about the funding side of the equation, I appreciate your earlier comment noting that the compression in NIM was kind of in line with our prior guidance. We did not take any further activities in this most recent quarter to further extend in any way our funding durations. So the compression you're seeing is a result of actions we've already taken to position the balance sheet. There's no more further pressure coming from that other than as the quarters roll and you get the comps with that higher funding cost in there, it will be there, and that's why we've given the guidance down to 9.5% going forward. So hopefully on the NIM side, hopefully on the expense side, that gives you some key pieces that will help you develop some comfort there.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks so much.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to touch on loan growth for a moment and card loan growth in particular. Obviously we're still sort of towards the high-end of the range, but we've seen some deceleration in the past couple of quarters. Can you just speak to is that some selective pulling back from some customer segments? Is that increased competition? How should we think about that, and are we sort of at a stable level here or should we think about more to come?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think this quarter we moved back a bit to the middle of our range. And we cited the broad retail sales growth across the country that decelerated this quarter. And we saw that in many of our competitor announcements as well.","We also saw the continuing impact of gas prices, which has impact sales and to a lesser degree loans. And I would acknowledge that it is more competitive now than it probably was a few years ago. We have been at the top end of our range and the top of the industry for now the last four years. And so while on the one hand we're still in the middle of our range, a lot of the actions we talked about are designed to try to accelerate that, because I'd rather find a way to get it back to the top of the range.","And that includes the double cash rewards on our Discover it program, which has seen good results in the early weeks of that program, our new Miles program, additional marketing spend, additional features like the on\/off functionality that's unique on our card. So we're taking a lot of actions to try to accelerate loan growth, but I'm pleased that we were in the middle of the range.","Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Really helpful color. Thank you. I just wanted \u2013 and secondly on the personal lending I think you mentioned some change in the pricing strategy. Is that sort of related to some of the marketplace lending that's coming about? Or more to do with changing consumer preferences for term and shorter duration?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well we \u2013 I think it's pretty modest, that portion of it. The duration, average duration is the bigger part. But I mentioned that we're expecting all-time record loan originations this year. And so I think that we are looking to continue to grow that business, because it's \u2013 unlike some of the new competitors \u2013 we're quite profitable and we're growing. And we want to keep taking advantage of our capabilities in the prime segment within personal loans.","Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yeah thank you. I guess, David, you mentioned the heightened competition in the press release. And obviously we're seeing it in our mailboxes as well. Could you just talk about how different it is versus what you planned for at the beginning of this year? And kind of how it's affecting the financials going forward? I mean I notice the rewards cost edged up pretty significantly sequentially. So maybe you could just talk about how that's expected to trend going forward, Mark? Thanks.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well and I mentioned competition is just one factor. And I'm not sure it's so much different than what we planned for. It's just a factor that makes it harder to grow as fast as we'd like. I think that it's still \u2013 if you look at mailboxes there's still a lot less intensity than there was pre-crisis. But I \u2013 and there's fewer players here post-crisis left in the market. It's consolidated.","But I think that some of the players that were really wounded from maybe credit mistakes and problems that they had made are kind of getting through those and are coming back in the market. And I think it's not lost on a lot of players that card returns are much higher than almost anything else in banking. And therefore it's an attractive place to compete. And so we are used to facing competition. We've done it for 30 years successfully. And so we view it as a challenge that we're up to.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I would say, Sanjay, just adding onto that the only thing I would say that has changed since the planning time is our expectations for overall retail sales growth. At the time we cut our plan last fall, Moody's, all the external providers, were basically expecting a much stronger retail sales growth climate than we're actually finding ourselves in today. So I would say that is the one major factor that has altered.","In response to your specific question on rewards categories I would say this quarter the driver was active engagement enrollment and the 5% rotating cashback category was the principal driver. I think for the full year the guidance we gave is we expected the rewards rate to be in the 105 basis point range. I don't see any reason to point you to something radically different. If there is any upward pressure on rewards costs, I would say it's 1 basis point or 2 basis points above and beyond that possibly. But nothing of significant magnitude from a rewards standpoint there.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. And, Mark, could I ask one follow-up question? Just on the NIM and the tax rate, could you just drill-down a little bit? Like just if you could give us more a specific cadence there, that would be great.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So the NIM, I think last quarter we saw from first quarter \u2013 from fourth quarter into first quarter we saw 7 basis points of compression. And I think we guided on the last call that we expected to see similar compression this quarter, which would have taken us from 9.69% to 9.62% and we printed a 9.63%. So I feel like we're pretty much in line with the cadence we were kind of calling out.","We do see further compression over the course of the remaining two quarters we're looking at going forward. But we still see ourselves remaining above a 9.5% NIM. I think if you want to use a linear approach to getting there, Sanjay, that's probably not a crazy way to think about modeling things I would say.","And then on the tax rate scenario, I would say the good guide this quarter was simply related to a resolution of a tax matter with a taxing authority. And it was just kind of one of those things that you'll have from time-to-time as you get favorable resolutions to matters that you've reserved for. So kind of hard for me to kind of guide you in terms of what that looks like going forward for when we might see other such things.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay great. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I'm going to focus on the competitive environment for a second, Mark. We talked about some of the higher spending customers may be getting poached away by some of the aggressive rewards offers out there. I just want to see from a strategic standpoint, is that getting worse or is it sort of stabilizing, especially if you think about some of the increased efforts you've made on the rewards side both in this quarter's results and also the double promotional points on it. Are you targeting to get back to the kind of growth you were experiencing in purchase volumes sort of more in line with the industry, or are you okay letting some of this business go?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say that our objective is to get sales growing a little faster. It was \u2013 ex gas it was 5%, and as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, that's when I would expect the gas thing to stop being something we talk so much about, because it'll be in the end-of-the-year comps. But 5% ex gas is still above retail sales growth, but if we can find ways to get that even higher than that, above retail sales growth, we will take actions to do so. And certainly some of our new rewards programs, marketing and so on are designed to do that. The one thing is we're not going to \u2013 we are focused on sustainability. We're not going to be entering an arms war.","Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. Just from a strategic standpoint, David, is it fair to say at this point in the cycle that the majority of your revenue growth will come from some of the other products rather than card, or is card still going to be the engine for growth here?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Both are going to be engines for growth. The card is going to be quite important because of its base size. The other products are going to tend to grow faster than card but from a lower base. So as we look out over the next year, the next three years, we need to maximize our profitable growth in all of our products.","Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. I look forward to that. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","David, as the Fed looks like it's about to potentially raise rates, how are you \u2013 how do you think the card industry is going to react in terms of card yields? Do you expect a sort of full 100 basis point asset beta, or do you think some of the competitors might actually create a stickier yield to where that doesn't necessarily get passed through knowing they're all floating rate loans?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I mean, post-CARD Act, as far as I know, all cards are variable rate and so we'll immediately reset upward. I think if you just focus narrowly on new account pricing, it might not be a perfect beta. But I would expect those rates to also go up, and it would certainly take a number of years for that to really filter into the portfolio. So I think that it'll immediately adjust up.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, thanks very much. In your prepared remarks, you guys talked about I think it was somewhat tied that you're seeing the customers still reticent to spend much, to maybe lever up a little bit, and at the same time you're seeing improved near-term credit outlook because delinquencies and loss trends. If those are tied together at this point, are you \u2013 is it possible that there's been a permanent shift or at least an intermediate term shift in customer trends? And if so, does that change long term expectations for both credit and loan growth opportunities?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that \u2013 I guess I would answer that as yes. We've already seen that, and I don't think it's going to go back to pre-crisis. We're not counting on huge loan growth in our industry in cards, but we also think that the new normal for credit is significantly different than pre-crisis. I think that consumer behavior has had a certain amount of permanent change as well as some of what competitors are willing to offer. You just don't see a lot of subprime players the way it existed in the past. And so the good news is that the industry is \u2013 feels like it's going to start returning to slow growth, and that's a lot different than the shrinkage we've seen for a number of years. And even as it does that, credit remains amazingly benign. And for us to achieve actual reduction in charge-off and delinquencies despite our loan growth this quarter, this far away from the crisis I think is remarkable.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","And as a little follow on to that, would that, over time, maybe give you an opportunity to go a little down market, you know, even if you did it very carefully just because it's possible that there's some increased demographic you could approach given the better outlook for overall credit?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me parse it two ways. Right now, the players who are in retailer and subprime kind of credit are seeing a pretty big resurgence in growth. But it's not a market that I'm particularly focused on. We're just not a subprime player. Now, at the same time, as credit and behavior gets worked into the models and given customers have lower risk, it opens up the universe a bit of people that could have prime performance, that maybe in the past we might not have been as confident that they would have had prime performance. So at the margin, we are looking for opportunities to expand our prime universe, particularly both in cards and personal loans.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Mark, thank you for the stratification of the drivers of the increased costs in the period. Just to focus in on that $40 million of regulatory costs, did that include both the personnel related component as well as the professional fee component? Or was it just one or the other? And I guess what I'm really trying to get to is what part of it is going to be sort of sustainable and recurring and what part of it can diminish?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Absolutely. So let me kind of give you how I'm getting to that rough $40 million number ballpark, and again these are rough numbers. They're not sniper rifle estimates. So you've got about $20 million directly related to the look-back that's been mandated in our regulatory consents. There was about another $5 million in, what I will call, general compliance type activity. There's about $5 million expense related to our information technology group and work they needed to do related to certain compliance related activities. And then there's about $10 million in, what I would call, non-volume head count that has come into the model over the course of the last year directly \u2013 it's really more second and third order effects.","So you don't see these people sitting in compliance, you don't see these people sitting in corporate risk, but the people in compliance and corporate risk are looking for more information, more reporting, more activity. So that's driving second and third order effects downstream. I'm, for my purposes, classifying that as, what I'll call, regulatory compliance related activity as well.","So if you look about the \u2013 if you look at it net-net, certainly 50% of that increase is non-recurring beyond this year as we get through that look-back type activities. I think we'd all be hopeful that we'd have the ability to pare back some portion of that additional 50% as we get this activity layered in. The head count is not coming out, which was $10 million of it, and I'm sure there will be some ongoing related activity as well. So I don't have the precise number to give you. Clearly, 50% of it is non-recurring. I'm comfortable saying that some portion of the remainder is non-recurring. What I can't do is give you a real sniper rifle estimate on what the tail on that looks like.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Very helpful. Thanks very much.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Mark, I was hoping I could get you to be a little bit more specific on the revised guidance around the provision. I think you indicated you expect it to be better than the 2.5% prior guidance, but given how low the first half run rate is, you could technically be above that run rate in the second half and still meet your guidance, but that certainly doesn't seem reasonable given that credit still remains really benign. Is there any kind of specifics you can give us on what you think the provision rate might look like?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Very fair question. I would say, Mark, at this point in time, that's one of the things we're trying to get behind ourselves as we kind of see this new normal credit environment creeping in that's offsetting the seasoning. So I'm not prepared at this point in time to give you a new provision rate, but I would kind of highlight one of the things that I pointed out in our prepared remarks when I kind of said we're going to have this increased level of expenses rounding from $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion because of some of these additional things that have come at us. But we do expect the goodness on the credit side relative to that provision guidance will pay for that. Right? So comfortable going that far at this point in time. Beyond that, we need to see a little bit more history, a little bit more activity to get a better sense on that front.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. But are you seeing anything in the data right now that would suggest a materially higher run rate in the second half of the year relative to where we've been in the first half of the year?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're continuing to see the book season, which is the key piece of the puzzle. The fundamental question is really on the consumer behavior side of the equation that I don't think we have enough history with yet to really be able to sniper rifle \u2013 give you a sniper rifle estimate on that. So again, I just \u2013 I don't want to give you guidance that I'm not comfortable with myself yet because we don't have all the ticking and tying done ourselves. I am comfortable telling you it's going to better than that 2.5%. I'm comfortable saying it'll pay for the expense increase. That goodness will pay for the increased expense guidance. Is there possibility it could be more than that? Yes, there's clearly a possibility it could be more than that but I need to get a little more facts on my side because I don't want to mislead you.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, got it. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good evening, guys. I guess on my first question, Mark, you noted in the prepared remarks on efficiency that you weren't happy with the level at which you were at, and you walked through some of the math. But I guess my question is as you think ahead to 2016, do you think the 38% efficiency target is achievable, given all the moving parts on expenses? Clearly, we don't know what the rate environment is going to look like, which could help the overall run rate, but I was just interested in what your early thoughts are on that looking ahead?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Ryan, I would kind of say it's a long term target that we want to hit and that we try to run the business model at. It's too early for me to give you guidance in next year in terms of where I think it's really going to come out, because there's going to be some \u2013 obviously some puts and takes as we go through our strategic planning process and our budgeting process for the year as well where we'll look to take some expenses out of the model. I think we'll probably look to make some growth investments and I just don't know how all those are going to shake out at this point in time. I'm very confident telling you that, as a management team, we're not happy with an adjusted efficiency ratio with a 40% tag associated with it.","I'm very confident that a significant chunk of the expenses in the model right now are non-recurring. But in terms of giving you guidance on exactly how close we're going to be to that 38%, either up above or below it, it's just too early for me to give you that.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And just maybe one follow-up financial question. I just wanted to make sure I fully understood the net interest margin outlook. Was that for the rest of this year or through 2016? And you made a comment earlier about some of the higher rates in the loan book are being replaced by standard rates. How far through the repricing process? Does it feel like we're getting close to the end on that? And how much of an impact is that actually having on the overall net interest margin?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I would say a couple things, Ryan. The net interest margin guidance I said \u2013 I think what we said is it'll stay above 9.5% at least through the end of 2016. So that's one where we have gone out a little bit further on our guidance at this point in time, and I'm comfortable really kind of saying I feel comfortable with that at this juncture.","In terms of the impact of the remixing of the portfolio and the impact to that, I would say in a post-CARD Act environment, the only balances you get to reprice up \u2013 or you get to price up are balances \u2013 new balances created after such point in time as that customer goes 60 days delinquent.","So you obviously don't refill that higher rate bucket very much. So I think you'll see continued movement out of that promotional category \u2013 or out of the high rate bucket rather \u2013 into the standard rate category. And that is a big factor in the driving of the margin compression candidly down to that 9.5% level.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You betcha.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Mark, on the double rewards I don't believe you guys are making those rewards available to customers until they've been with you for a year. But is the cost of those double rewards hitting the rewards expense line now? Or is that going to come later?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. That's being accrued in the rewards expense line. You got to accrue that on the fly. So we are handling that accrual, and it is in the numbers you see.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. So earlier you had mentioned that one of the things that drove the rewards higher this quarter was the 5% cash back category. But that would \u2013 another factor would be the double rewards contributing to the higher rewards expense this quarter? Is that correct?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I would say that's absolutely mathematically correct. I would tell you it's a relatively small number, because it's really spending only related to new accounts. Right? So you got the installed base is one issue, but then you got the new account activity that's qualifying for it as well. So I would say the driver is clearly not the double. The driver was clearly where the 5% category was this quarter.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott J. Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thanks very much for taking my question. With regard to the student loan, the settlement I guess, or the fine the CFPB announced, is that going to have any material impact on servicing expense of student loans going forward or the profitability of the student loans going forward?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. It related to some practices that we actually changed a while back, so everything is in the run rate.","Scott J. Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And then just a follow-up question on M&A. In the past you've mentioned you look at adjacent kind of businesses to consumer lending. And just wondering if you continue to look? And maybe what areas you're looking in? Or what areas you see as interesting right now?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I would say in terms of the areas where we would look, those would be the areas we would generally look. We obviously don't give any specific thoughts on M&A type related matters, other than at this point in time I would say we've gone on the record and said while we're under a BSA\/AML consent order, it's unlikely we would look to M&A type activities. I think we kind of feel we have to get that one rectified.","But I think in terms of generally where we would devote our attentions, yeah, I think natural adjacencies where we can lever strengths we have internally, as opposed to trying to take quantum leaps and say entering the commercial real estate lending business or something. That doesn't feel like our DNA.","Scott J. Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. All right, thanks very much.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good evening guys. I just want to get a sense of how you measure the payback for some of these new card features. Does it really lower the cost of acquisition for new customers? Or maybe change the revolving (44:00) or spend patterns relative to some of the legacy cards?","And then going forward as you lap some of these expense headwinds, you mentioned perhaps a little more incremental investment. Is that the case? Do you expect to see additional opportunities in 2016 to really deploy? And kind of where do you think the best dollars would be most efficiently used there?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, David, I'll handle the first half and have Mark handle your second question. We look carefully at the net present value expected from all of our accounts. And then we \u2013 when we make changes, we run those through. And we try it and we test. And we work to maximize the long-term profitability of any action we take.","Certainly one of those actions and some of our actions do help our cost per account. And even though we've mentioned heightened competition a couple times on this call, you normally would see all other things equal that that would show up as higher acquisition costs, and we have not seen that at this point. We've actually seen slightly lower average cost per account in our card business this year than in the past. And that's partly because of the marketing and feature functionality that we've taken.","We also see \u2013 when we see different performance in some of our products like our extension into Discover it Miles has significantly higher average sales volume per new account. That comes back into the P&L. And for those accounts we could actually afford to pay a little more if we're going to get more over the long term.","So we look at every activity with its own P&L. And, Mark, maybe you can hit on the second question on capital buyback?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh absolutely. Yeah, so on the buyback activity, what I would say is we continue to be very focused on producing high yield. I think we got close to a 9% total yield right now between dividends and buybacks. We clearly recognize we have too much capital at this point in time and within the constraints of the regulatory process and the CCAR process, we are very focused on finding ways to return that capital to shareholders.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, was there anything else on capital?","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, I was actually more focusing on kind of where you think the best marketing opportunities would be in 2016.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, for deployment. I'm sorry. I misunderstood the question. My apologies, David. So in terms of the best opportunities for deploying it, I think you see us making a lot of those investments today in the it platform right now would be one key piece of the puzzle I would say is a good place for deploying that capital. We continue to, as David noted earlier, to see great CPAs and very active, engaged card member behavior there.","I think there's a lot of investments going into digital right now, digital and mobile platforms. Our key focus on the information technology side and investments being made there very heavily. I think in the non-card lending businesses, the direct banking businesses, I think digital investments there are also forefront critical and are consuming capital at this point in time and we're seeing good returns associated with those. And I think you already know we're actively engaged in migrating all of our banking platform products to a new core banking system as well. So that's a driver also. So we watch the expected payback and the budgets associated with all these projects very, very closely, and I'm comfortable that we continue to have a disciplined process around the investments we're making.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the \u2013 so I wasn't clear on the postage rebate, the $17 million.

Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was an annual number, Bob, that tended to generally fall into the second quarter. It was $17 million last year. So the increase this year is pulling up that comp. It varied year-to-year, but last year it was $17 million and this year the postal service chose to not renew that rebate. So it's a once-a-year kind of thing. It'll adjust this year, and then it will be out of the run rate going forward.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then as we look at the marketing spend in the back half of the year kind of the similar trend to what we've seen like, say, last year, the ramp-up from \u2013 I mean, you wouldn't have the same ramp-up I guess because of the $17 million, but the same general trend in the back half of the year. You're not expecting any change in marketing trend?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I actually think the marketing expense kind of hit its high watermark this quarter for the year. We'll actually \u2013 I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had some timing differences in campaigns. So I think you've seen the marketing expense hit its high watermark over the course of the year. It'll down a little bit from here, although it'll be higher in the fourth quarter than the third.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Are you seeing anything alarming in the student loan portfolio? Student loan player had brought \u2013 had some issues on the credit side with a certain portfolio that was going back into payment. Have you seen anything alarming in your student loan portfolio from a credit perspective?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we haven't.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just last question, Ariba, is that going to be a material business, the B2B business? And over what timeframe could it become material?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think in the short- and medium-term, it could become material volume, we hope. I think I would not expect material profitability or revenues any time soon, it is B2B. It's low margin, but it's a huge market. And so, over the long period of time, we hope to build some very large significant volumes and there may be the potential for some ancillary related services that could also be profitable.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Have you been adding new corporations to that business?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","I know you signed one very large partner.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have been adding additional participants.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Sure. I wanted to ask one question around the credit quality and I understand it's better than you'd expected. As we look at the master trust data in your early stage delinquencies, I see that in that bucket delinquency rates around 40 basis points, historically low by your standards. Should we still be, though, thinking about your broader portfolio, so not just the master trust subset, as reflecting something a little different than that? Because I have trouble making the math work to go from like 40 basis points early stage delinquencies to the kind of provision you're talking about.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I would say there is \u2013 Chris, there is a discrepancy between the master trust and the managed book. So if you think about the master book, I think we're coming up on or have just lapped six years since we have added any new accounts to that. So it's a very well-seasoned book. And one of the things you'll see in a well-seasoned book is on a like-for-like basis, so if you have a FICO score \u2013 just pick a random number \u2013 a 750 FICO account that's brand-new and a 750 FICO account that's been with you for 10 years, the 750 that's been with you for 10 years performs better. I don't think that's unique to Discover.","I think that's just a phenomena you see in the consumer lending space. So there definitely is a disconnect between the performance of a well-seasoned book and the seasoning of a newly acquired book that you put on there. So absolutely there is a disconnect there. That's why we give you some of the managed data as well along with those master trust releases on a monthly basis so that you can kind of get a little bit of insight into there.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. And then separately here, just thinking about reward spending and your quarterly promotions there, this quarter you've got one with Amazon and I think a couple years ago when you did a promotion with Amazon and maybe a broader mix of online merchants around the fourth quarter, you had an elevated rewards level. Anyway, any early reaction to having Amazon in the mix for about three weeks here? It seems like it interacts very well with your customer base.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It interacts very well with the customer base. We have a great relationship with that firm as well. I guess what I would say is that fourth quarter from a few years back was the result of a very broad category. This is targeted specifically at Amazon, and no, I'm not concerned about a repeat of that event from several years ago.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Amazon and home improvement.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","David Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks. I had a question, sort of a follow up to the comments David made earlier about competition and consumer behavior. I wonder at the margin, given your very high returns and very low charge-off and delinquency rate, is it possible to, I guess, modify your credit standards slightly and increase growth, or is there just a sharp drop-off in the behavior of customers? And as Mark, you just mentioned, you do a lot better with seasoned customers than new customers. I guess I wonder what the tradeoff's like and if you can update us on the mix, how much of the portfolio today at the end of the second quarter is relatively new and how much is older.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think we had an earlier question kind of on that. I think at the margin, I do think there is some opportunity to take a little more risk to get a little more growth to increase profitability. And in some cases, it's really taking the same risk, but we're basically being able to expand the credit bucket a bit given the confidence that some of those consumer behavioral change that has occurred is here for an extended period of time. The only thing I would say is I wouldn't take the leap that we're going to suddenly do giant line increases to drive a huge amount of growth, because that will usually come back and bite you. We're not going to just jump into subprime to accelerate growth. So I would just emphasize modest and at the margin, and we're always looking for opportunities.","David Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And how much of the portfolio are the two accounts that are more than, let's say, three years old at this point or two years old?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our average customer has been with us for 12 years, which is we believe the highest in the industry. It's one of the reasons our credit is so good. Our focus on service as well as having great credit quality helped with that. About 17% of our book is three years or less of age.","David Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good evening.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good evening.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just quick question on the recent decision to exit the direct mortgage business. You called out some of the charges you took this quarter as well as some additional charges in the back half. It sounds like those will be offset by a tax benefit. But just for modeling purposes, what was the amount of fee income you booked from that business, and any associated expenses that presumably will roll-off over the course of the next six months or so?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so I'll point you back to some other places to kind of compose it. So in terms of revenues, we've published mortgage revenue in the 10-Qs historically, and it was roughly plus or minus $80 million on an annual basis, give or take. And then I would say the other thing I'd point you toward is we kind of said that the business was roughly operating at a break-even level. So I think that kind of gets you to sort of how to adjust your model as you're looking into 2016, more or less.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe just a follow up on Diners Club, maybe just an update on what your expectations are for that business? I think typically you see some favorable seasonality in the fee income line from Diners. I just wanted to get an update.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think we don't \u2013 I think you could look back at previous seasonality where it's typically the revenue's front-end loaded in the first quarter, and we don't really see that changing. I guess the thing I feel good about on Diners is we've had to take a lot of actions to get stronger franchises in certain markets, to deal with Citi exiting in certain markets that they were in to deal with the economy in Europe, and it feels like we're on a much more level to growing field.","We're back in the double-digit growth on volume. We're seeing some very nice volumes out of our Chinese, Indian, and certain other franchises, Japanese is growing nicely. And we've gotten \u2013 we had to step in there at the Italian situation. We've now got a buyer, so we're back into just operating the network everywhere once we close that. So Diners is still a relatively small part of the overall profit picture, but nonetheless it feels like a much more positive trajectory.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","I'd like to turn the call back to Bill Franklin for further remarks","Bill Franklin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Abigail.

My name is Celisia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2018 Discover Financial Services earnings conference call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services","Thank you, Celisia. Welcome, everyone, to this afternoon's call. I'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8K report and in our 10-K and Second Quarter 10-Q, which are on our website and also on file with the SEC.","In the Third Quarter 2018 materials, we've provided information that compares and reconciles our non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. And, of course, we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. As we announced on August 3, effective October 1, Roger Hochschild succeeded David Nelms as Chief Executive Officer of Discover. David and Roger worked together in leading Discover for 20 years, with Roger serving as President and Chief Operating Officer since 2004. Roger's been very active with the investment community in the past, so he should be well-known to many of you. And the transition in leadership should be as seamless to all of you as it's been to our 16,000 colleagues at Discover.","Our call today will include remarks from Roger, covering third quarter highlights and developments. Then, Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And as Celisia said, after Mark completes his comments, there'll be time for questions and answers. But I would ask during the Q&A session, if you would please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'm tremendously honored to succeed David as CEO. This transition comes with Discover in a great position, generating solid growth and robust returns, and with the Discover brand stronger than ever. Discover represents a unique combination of assets built on a culture that places the highest value on serving our customers, whether by introducing unique features in our card business or innovations in payments.","I'm proud to have been part of the team for 20 years and excited to have the opportunity to build upon that legacy as we pursue our aspiration to be consumers' most trusted financial partner. Even with a change at the top, our priorities remain the same. First, the Discover lens-centric business model, integrated with the benefits of our proprietary network, remains at the core. We will continue to invest in the brand, in a differentiated customer experience, and in advanced analytics. And, of course, we'll maintain our consistent conservative approach to credit risk management. This strategy has served us well and continues to produce outstanding results.","With that let's turn to slide 3, and review those results for the Third Quarter. We earned $720 million after tax, or $2.05 per share this quarter, generating a return on equity of 26%. This performance reflects the strength of the Discover business model, as well as consistent execution on our strategic priorities. Looking at the fundamentals, total loans grew by 8% in the quarter, led by 9% growth in the card business. This was above industry average, as the Discover brand continues to resonate with our target customers. New accounts were up 14% year-to-date, and we're also seeing higher engagement with both the number of active card members and spending per card member growing nicely. Our private student loan business shows the strength of the Discover brand beyond the card business, setting us up for another year of record originations. Student loan originations during the peak season were up 12%, as a result of improved brand awareness and greater effectiveness in our marketing efforts.","In Personal Loans, it's clear the competitive intensity has not lessened, supported by the significant level of capital that has entered the market over the last few years. Much of this competition is from unbranded players, which means that their principal means of differentiation and growth is on price or credit standards. As we said, we will not chase growth that does not meet our return objectives, hence our decision to cut back on origination activity, and we continue to expect personal loan receivables at year-end to be flat to down from the prior year end.","Focusing now on Credit. Overall performance is encouraging. In our card portfolio, the seasoning of recent years' vintages, along with continued normalization in the back book are in line with our expectations. In addition, we continue to invest in enhancements, not only in our underwriting processes, but also our servicing platform. We are increasingly leveraging data, advanced analytics, and machine learning to enhance the quality and efficiency of our servicing activities whether in day-to-day customer service or how we collect past-due accounts. This is paying off for us in a variety of ways. It creates a better customer experience, it improves the scalability of servicing operations, and it leads to better credit performance.","Turning to Payment Services. The segment generated a healthy 22% increase in pre-tax income, driven by strong volume growth at PULSE, and in our network partners' business. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to personally thank David for his leadership over the last 20 years. I'm enormously proud of the business and the team we built together over that time, and I couldn't be more excited about Discover's prospects for the future. I'll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Roger, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our Summary Financial Results on slide 4. Looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue growth of 8% this quarter was driven primarily by strong loan growth. The increase in provision was largely consistent with ongoing supply-driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well as the seasoning of our strong loan growth. Operating expenses rose 7% year-over-year, as a result of higher compensation expense, as well as investments in support of both growth and new capabilities. The effective tax rate this quarter was 25.5%, versus our expectation for about 24%, as a result of adjustments to reserves for certain tax matters, which cost us about $0.02 per share. We continue to expect that our effective tax rate for the full year will be about 24%.","Turning to slide 5, total loans increased 8% over the prior year, led by 9% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise balances drove much of this increase, spurred by continued strong sales growth. Promotional balances were a modest contributor to growth this quarter, coming in somewhat above our expectations. We are seeing higher-than-expected response rates, a FICO profile north of the portfolio average, and strong economics from these channels. As a result we made a decision to maintain the mix of promotional balances around their current levels as opposed to our prior expectation for them to decline. Obviously, if we see a deterioration in these economics, we'll revisit this approach.","Looking at our other primary lending products, year-over-year growth in personal loans slowed to 2%, and, as Roger said, balances are expected to be flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis by year-end, reflecting the continued impact of credit tightening. Private student loan balances rose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 10% year-over-year.","Moving to the results from our Payment segment, on the right-hand side of slide 5, you can see that proprietary volume rose 9% year-over-year. In Payment Services, PULSE volume growth was strong again this quarter, with 14% higher volume compared to the prior year, driven by both new issuers as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Diners Club volume rose 5% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises, and Network Partners' volume increased 34%, driven by AribaPay volume.","Moving to revenue on slide 6, net interest income increased $173 million or 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Total non-interest income grew $26 million, primarily from a 12% increase in discount and interchange revenue. Sales volume also grew by 12%, led by growth in active card members and, to a lesser extent, higher spend per account. Adjusted for the number of processing days, sales growth was 9%. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 131 basis points, up one basis point year-over-year. As shown on slide 7, our net interest margin was 10.28% for the quarter, flat compared to the prior year and up 7 basis points sequentially. Relative to the third quarter of last year, the net benefit of a higher prime rate is offset by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge-offs. Relative to the second quarter, the net benefit of a higher prime rate and modest sequential improvement in interest charge-offs was partially offset by higher deposit costs in both brokered and direct-to-consumer.","As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing better-than-expected production levels, credit quality and economics in our promotional channels. In addition, we are seeing month-over-month decreases in the portfolio revolve rate, as transactor engagement continues to pick up. For these reasons, we now expect NIM for the full year to come in modestly below our prior guidance of 10.3% to 10.4%. Total loan yield increased 30 basis points from a year ago to 12.45% as a result of a 23 basis point increase in card yield and a 63 basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases and a modest increase in the revolve rate led card yield higher, partially offset by a higher mix of promotional balances and higher charge-offs","In student loans, where about two thirds of the portfolio has a variable rate, higher short-term interest rates drove the 63 basis point increase in yield. On the liability side of the balance sheet, consumer deposits grew 12% as we continued to shift our funding mix toward more stable and cost-effective sources. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter, increasing 17 basis points sequentially and 51 basis points year-over-year. Deposit betas have increased, although cumulative betas continue to be better than historic norms and our expectations.","Turning to slide 8, operating expenses rose $67 million from the prior year. Employee Compensation and Benefits was higher, the result of higher average salaries as well as increased volume-related and technology head count to support business growth. Marketing expenses were up as a result of greater investment in generating new loans, and these investments are yielding great returns. For example, in Credit Card, while total marketing dollars are up, acquisition costs per account are down on a year-to-date basis, and we expect that trend to continue through the fourth quarter. As Roger talked about earlier, we continue to invest in infrastructure and analytic capabilities, which led to an increase in information processing costs.","I'll now discuss credit results on slide 9. Total net charge-offs rose 34 basis points from the prior year but are down 14 basis points, sequentially, in line with normal seasonality. Supply-driven credit normalization, along with the seasoning of loan growth from the past few years, continue to be the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs. Credit card net charge-offs rose 34 basis points year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, this quarter represented the fourth consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge-offs. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 18 basis points year-over-year, and 16 basis points sequentially. Credit performance in the card business has been very solid. We've also mitigated a degree of future exposure by selectively closing long-term inactive accounts, eliminating nearly $30 billion in contingent risk since the beginning of 2017.","Private student loan net charge-offs fell 18 basis points year-over-year, but were up 4 basis points sequentially. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 90 basis points from the prior year, and 12 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus delinquency rate was up 30 basis points year-over-year, and 15 basis points sequentially. There are a number of factors driving personal loan credit performance. First, is the seasoning and normalization phenomena that is also driving losses in Card. This trend continues to develop as we expected. Second, is the loss experience in certain origination channels we started discussing with you in the third quarter of last year. We cut off all origination activities in these sub-segments as soon as the problems became apparent, but the 24-month seasoning curve in personal loans means that the related losses will peak in the next few quarters. This'll drive dollars of charge-off higher until the pig is through the python. Third, I would point out that slowing loan growth will also contribute to higher charge-off rates, because of the denominator effect. And finally, there is a seasonality aspect to our personal loan charge-offs, in that we typically see sequential increases in both the fourth and first quarters. Putting all this together, we would expect to see about a 60, 6-0, basis point increase sequentially in the personal loan charge-off rate, in the fourth quarter, and a full year 2019 charge-off rate of around 5%.","Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 20 basis points sequentially, as loan balances grew. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 109%. To sum up the quarter on slide 11, we generated 8% total loan growth at a 26% return on equity. Our Consumer Deposit business also posted robust growth at 12%, while deposit rates increased 51 basis points year-over-year. With respect to credit, our total company charge-off rate below 3%, reflects very positive underlying trends in Card and Student Loan. Finally we're continuing to execute on our capital plan with strong loan growth and capital returns helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels.","In conclusion we're pleased with our performance this quarter, characterized by strong receivables growth, good credit performance, and very strong returns. That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Celisia to open the line for Q&A.","Operator","We'll take our first question from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, and good afternoon. I guess my first question relates to the NIM. It's been fairly stable, all things being equal, and obviously you're ratcheting down the guidance. Mark, could you roll through maybe the puts and takes to what is impacting that outlook for the rest of the year, please.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Sure, absolutely. Ken, I'll just tackle it head-on and say it's a conscious decision on our part. When we had our call last quarter we were looking at a forecast that was at the lower end of our guidance range and we were planning on taking down our level of promotional activity as a percentage of our total balances. And, we made some changes and we saw incredibly strong response rates in economics start flowing through. So, we made a conscious decision that we could either manage to a NIM rate or we could manage to the long-term shareholder value creation by booking business that was demonstrating extremely strong return profiles. We made the decision that we would sacrifice the NIM in the near term to book that good long-term business. So, that's the underlying thought process behind it all, I would say. If you think about it in context quarter over quarter, market rates got you about a 9 basis point good guy for NIM, the funding rate took away about 5 bps, credit with charge-offs of accrued interest being lower added back about 2 bps and then the receivables to rate was about a point or two with promo rates being a little bit higher. So, net, net that gets you 8 basis points sequentially in NIM. And, we continue to be positioned to be modestly asset sensitive. The bigger driver of NIM trajectory's going forward is going to more likely be that mix of promo balances that we now expect to be flat. So we would continue to expect some NIM accretion in the fourth quarter but it will not get us all the way to that prior guidance range.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And, firstly, Roger, welcome to the call, and congratulations on your elevated role. I'm interested in kind of a bigger-picture question. Obviously, you mentioned in the prepared remarks the lend-centric model that Discover's been so well-known for. Obviously, you've got a payments business both within the Discover card in a way that is more payments-related and obviously is geared towards transactors. Could you maybe just think, or help us think through, what, how you want to be kind of targeting these different markets? We have juxtapose it with, like, an American Express, who's very transaction-oriented, and has been moving into lending. They think that they have an easy way to pick up balances. You're more of a lend-centric business, and maybe you're trying to pick up transactors. Could you maybe just help us think through that strategic decision that you make.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. Thanks, Ken. I wouldn't confuse our Payments business with a focus on transactors. In fact, the biggest part of our Payments profitability comes from PULSE, which is a Debit business. So, Payments business is really working with third parties, whether they are networks around the world, our Diners Club franchisees or the banks that issue over PULSE.","In terms of our card-issuing business, we remain very focused on our lend-centric model. That's something we've had consistently. And, so, while, again, we're seeing great transaction growth and net income growth in Payments, a lot of that is actually driven by the Debit market.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Maybe I can just, I realize I only have one follow-up. Maybe, within the Discover card, though, you're clearly trying to bring in transactors just through the, effectively, the rewards, the cashback rewards that's more driven towards transactors. But you need to convert those to borrowers to really drive the earnings model. I guess that's really what I was going with.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. We've had rewards since we invented rewards over 30 years ago. So, I wouldn't point to that as a change from our lend-centric model.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Sanjay.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey. Congratulations, Roger.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Sanjay.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","So, first question, Mark, for you is on the personal loan provisions. Is it fair to assume most of the provisioning related to that pig is behind us? Or should we expect more pressure as it relates to the losses there?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, if you look, our reserve rate was flat quarter-over-quarter, Sanjay. So, what you saw going on over the prior year since we started talking about this, you saw big increases in our reserve rate for the Personal Loan business. Now what you're seeing is those things for which we wrote the reserves starting to migrate through to charge-off. So, you'll still have that normalization phenomena we talked about impacting personal loans. And you'll still have, obviously, whatever happens to the economy between now and then. But that vintage of loans that we've been talking about that was driving reserves is now just blowing through to charge-off.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. My follow-up question, I guess, is for Roger. It's sort of like the second question previously. Maybe you could just talk about how your approach might be different than David's was. I know you guys have seen, generally, eye-to-eye. But maybe you could just talk about any changes, even if nuanced, that you'd propose. Thanks.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. You know, for 14 years, as President, I ran all the operating areas of Discover. So got to drive a lot of the growth, whether it's in the Payments segment, whether it's around our technology strategy or the new features we launched on the Card side. So, I think, really, it's continuing the path we're on. We have a great set of assets. We've been very successful in diversifying our direct banking business from beyond Card, and we're incredibly excited about the growth opportunities we see in the Payments business as well. I'd point to some of the partnerships we're striking with networks around the world. So again, I would not expect any big changes in strategy, but a continued focus around execution, and driving growth.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys, and Roger, congrats again.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe I could start with the promotional activity, Mark, that you talked about keeping at the same level. Could you maybe expand a little bit on what drove the decision to keep it at current levels, particularly what changed over the course of this quarter, relative to your view last quarter to run it down? Are you seeing it more just turning into revolve? You know, what drove the changes over the short-term?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So a couple things. Great question, Ryan. A couple things drove the change to the outlook. First of all, we did reduce the marketing eligible populations. We expected that would result in a response rate that would be lower. What we actually saw is when we reduced those marketing eligible populations and refocused on the remaining populations, we actually saw the response rates go up meaningfully. So the return on the invested dollars ended up being higher than we expected to see it.","Number two, I would say, is the engagement we're getting out of these folks. So these aren't just balance transfers; we're talking sales promo as well. So, new account promotional activity as well, right. And we're seeing very strong engagement, actually an uptick in engagement across a number of those different sub-segments relative to what we had seen previously. So, that was a piece of it. And then, I had mentioned the FICO score has actually migrated north. It's actually, the FICO score that we're getting in these accounts right now is actually well north of the portfolio FICO for the card accounts, and the marginal ROEs actually ticked up meaningfully from what we've been seeing.","So when you put that all in the blender and hit go, we really sat down and said, okay, again, we can manage to a NIM rate, because we're not insensitive to when we give you guys guidance, obviously. By the same token, managing to the NIM rate would have been walking away from fabulous business that's going to be really accretive to shareholder value over time. So, we made what we thought was the right decision. So that was kind of the facts and the thought process.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for all the color on that, and maybe there's a question for Roger. Roger, we're hearing a lot of your competitors talking about accelerating marketing, American Express, Capital One talked about it on their call last night. And I just wanted to get your view on the competitive intensity in the card market. You guys have talked about loan growth slowing, pulling back from various channels, and just wanted to get your sense for the overall competitive landscape, given that, obviously with given where the stocks are trading on P\/E, the market's obviously concerned that there could be a downturn at some point in the not-so-distant future. So, any color you have there would be appreciated.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, I think, first, the comments on loan growth slowing and pulling back from certain channels are really about the personal loan business. New accounts are up strongly on the card side. We're seeing great productivity on our new account investments, so even with significantly more new accounts, cost per account is down. My view is the card business is always competitive. There might have been a lull in 2008-2009, but the key is putting a great value proposition out there. We continue to differentiate in terms of customer experience, and the functionality we provide. So, again, we feel very good about the growth we're putting up, and we're continuing to invest in driving that growth.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, I had a question about card delinquency rate, 30-plus day. I was curious, it's been relatively stable on a year-over-year basis, arguably has been a tiny bit elevated more recently. I was just curious how you see that trend playing out. Do we stay steady, or do we have a bias to the upside because of growth math? And then also, Mark, on the reserve bill, you've been sort of hanging out in this $100 million range. How do you think about that on a going forward basis, you know, just directionally?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So in terms of the delinquency rate and the charge-offs, it was the fourth consecutive quarter, Don, where we've see a slowdown in the rate of increase in charge-off formation. So I think that migration has stopped. Delinquencies, I agree, have, they came down from call it 37 middle of last year plus or minus the increase, 37 basis points to more or less flat at about 16, 18 basis points, something like that over the course of the last few quarters. So, they are down meaningfully. I think one of the big drivers is the growth map piece. Right? As Roger mentioned, we had very strong growth in new accounts. We continue to target new card members selectively in this environment. We think the window for growth remains open with the current macro backdrop. So, if you think about the reserve piece as opposed to delinquency piece for a second, roughly, call it 35%, 40% of what you see for reserving is new account related, with the remainder being more season back book related. Right? So, in that context, you do have a big chunk of it that is being driven by the growth map, to use my competitors' terminology. So, but we think it's manageable. We feel very good about where it is, and we love the economics.","In terms of the overall reserve build at the roughly $99 million, the bulk of that was related to card and really reflects what we see coming at us in that seasoning and in those pieces of the puzzle. It's down, the card reserve build is down, call it $20 million, over the same quarter last year despite generating a bigger amount of new accounts. That probably tells you something about the quality of the accounts and what we expect to see going on there. So, it continues to feel like we're booking really high-end, high-quality business right now. And I feel good about what we're putting on the books. Reserve rate going forward is also going to be impacted by macroeconomic factors and everything else, so I don't want to prognosticate other than to say we like what we're putting on the books.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. I have a question about loan growth, maybe for Mark. Is the implication and the commentary around NIM and the decision to do more of the promotional balances than you originally thought, is part of the implication that maybe loan growth comes in at the higher end or above the higher end of expectations?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So, I think, if you think about it in terms of our guidance range for the full year for total loans of 7% to 9%, I certainly think you would come in north of the midpoint of that range as we sit here right now, I think that's a reasonable expectation. I think one of the things we're encouraged by, again, is not just the level of growth we're seeing, but, again, I'll reemphasize the quality of that growth, the FICO profile that's coming in from this incremental business that we have elected not to run off because of what we've seen since making some of those changes, or not to run down, since making some of those changes I alluded to earlier. Feel good not just about the level of growth but of the quality of the growth we're finding right now. And to Roger's point earlier, as well, cost-effective acquisition of these accounts right now. Marketing expenses are up, but cost per account are down.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then for my follow-up. I think, during the quarter, we heard a lot of incremental commentary from other players in the personal loan space that they were seeing credit, at least from loans purchased from some of the marketplace lenders, it was coming in worse than expected, economics that were looking worse. Did you see anything during the quarter that made you incrementally more concerned and maybe has you close to the guidance of being down year-over-year versus potentially flat?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No, I mean, I think we haven't really seen anything new over the course of the last, since we spoke to you last in terms of the development there. We did start pulling back a full year ago. It was the third quarter of last year when we really started talking to you about what we started seeing in some of these segments. So, I think in Consumer Lending, you've got to have very, you've got to have continuous monitoring, and you've got to have tollgates set up for if you see certain things start to happen, they need to drive actions.","So, I think we probably saw some of that start to emerge early and took action relatively more quickly, but there's no question, as we've said before, just the pile-on effect of every day you open your financial press and there's somebody else talking about entering the Personal Loan space. We've said all along, there's a time when you want to get on the accelerator in this business and a time when it makes more sense to, there's still a window of opportunity for personal loan growth. It's just nowhere near as wide as it once was, and you've got to be more selective.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks. I was sort of wondering, given your comments about continued strong balance growth, but improving quality, could you kind of put that into context of, this sort of was addressed partially in a previous question. But when you think about the reserve needs for that portfolio, again, keeping the economy constant was we go into 2019, how should we think about that for the Card business?","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","So, one of the big swing factors in an actuarial portfolio, as you know, Moshe, is the macro factors. So, if you control for those and, say, hold all the macro factors exactly constant, right? It would really be more a function of just how much of the book is going through seasoning at that point in time. So, it would be what percentage of the book is new accounts would be the driver. And then, the second piece would be what is going on with consumer leverage out there more broadly. So, what's happening to loss severities, given a default.","Those would really become the two swing factors that would drive that. We have seen consumers re-approach that normalized level of leverage. It's kind of what we believe is part of what's driving this normalization in losses beginning to slow. Right? The normalization and charge-offs beginning to approach some type of a normalized rate. So, I would say based on what we see now we don't see over-leveraging being something that I would say driving it right now. But that could change tomorrow, just to be clear. But we don't see it right now. So, I would say, going forward, those reserves are going to be far more affected by what percentage of the book is new accounts at that point in time would really be the swing factor if you neuter all the macro economic effects.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thanks. And maybe a second question. I'm very impressed with the declining acquisition costs. And you've alluded to it before, but it seems like it's a more significant factor now. And I guess I'm trying to understand just given that this is a continued competitive industry, and you do see large upfront bonuses that many issuers are offering, like, what would you attribute that to and anything you can kind of tell us about the persistence of your revenue streams post promo pricing and how that's faring in this environment.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. So, in terms of new account pricing and promotions, we've tried to steer away from those kind of big-ticket $300, $500. We do double the cashback bonus for the first year and have found that to work very, very well and don't see a significant decline in spending once that promotional period expires because it's really driving long-term usage over an entire year.","A lot of the benefits in terms of cost per account come from product differentiation, customer experience differentiation and just the strength of the brand. So, by leveraging our proprietary network, the advertising we have is working well, and then some of the investments we've been making around analytics. And so, optimizing, whether it's direct mail, whether it's the digital channels, optimizing conversion rate, those are really paying off and letting us achieve those lower-cost per account even as we book more accounts and have been tightening our credit box.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Let me just add my congratulations, Roger. Thanks.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Hi. Thanks a lot, Moshe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and I'll add my congratulations as well.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Just to follow up on some of these topics, the efficacy of the marketing spend, as you've talked about, is very apparent, and the flat level of marketing dollars spent. And yet growth remains very robust. But, I guess, then, like, is the offset in the income statement therefore coming primarily from the rewards rate in terms of where the cost of this promotional activity is being captured?","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","To some degree, I would say, Eric, that's a fair statement. So, we, kind of think of marketing dollars and rewards to some degree as flip-sides of the same coin. So, either way, you're trying to attract and engage customers to engage with the brand, right. So, sometimes that's more effectively done via marketing dollars, sometimes more effectively done via rewards. Last quarter, rewards were a big driver not only on the doubles promotion on the new accounts, if you hold the sales promo piece that we saw, but also our 5% rotating cashback category that we do. Last quarter it was restaurants, and we saw the highest level of engagement with the 5% rotating category we have ever seen in our history. So I think, yes, we are targeting in on some of those rewards pieces of the puzzle as a trade-off. But even if you think about it that way, rewards rate year-over-year increase is pretty darned modest, and you look at the growth into accounts we're getting, as well as the growth in balances from existing card members, I think the marketing team has done a great job dialing in getting that mix right, and really kind of driving great new account acquisition.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you for that, and Mark, if I can just follow up on one other expense line item, which is the information processing.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yep.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","What are the analytical capabilities that you guys are investing in, and is a function, and what's motivating that? Is it a perceived lack of capability relative to peers, or what's driving that investment at this stage?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So a portion of it is directly related to where that development is taking place. Historically, when you did legacy development for in-house systems, the development cost was capitalized. Today, we are pivoting much more into the Cloud, and a lot of the development work in the Cloud gets expensed. So that is a big piece of the driver of what's going on. In terms of exactly where we're investing, I'll kick it over to my partner Roger here to give you his thoughts on that one.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, I'd start by saying it's not driven by a feeling that we're lagging behind our peers, it's being driven by the opportunities we see, truly, over a multi-year horizon. If you look at the tremendous changes that are going on, and I hate throwing around the term, sort of, big data or machine learning, but you are seeing fundamental changes in the power of analytics. And if you think about everything that is model-driven in our environment, whether it's fraud, whether it's credit, whether it's marketing, and the ability of sort of next-generation models and technologies to drive significant results, let alone sort of automation, whether it's in the call centers or robotic process automation, those are some of the investments we're making and, again, we believe this will be a multi-year journey.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Buckingham.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question, congratulations. Want to talk about the brand campaign for a little bit. The advertising budget's been relatively flat, it looks like, from our perspective, but still see relatively high levels of advertising on TV. I'm just wondering if you can measure or discuss at all the lift you're getting from that brandings. The numbers look, consistently, getting share. You mentioned the positive trends you're seeing in the portfolio. How much can you attribute that to the brand, and then, on a related question, when are we going to see advertising as a cash back checking product? That seems like a no-brainer as a pretty successful product. Thanks.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, so, in terms of overall advertising, I think cross-channel attribution over a complex consumer decision journey, such as getting a credit card, is one of the biggest challenges in marketing. We've been investing heavily in that area as well, and the ability to track, sort of, where customers see our advertising, and what drove them to apply for a card. Some of that is proprietary, but the team in marketing does a great job in terms of making sure that we are getting value for our advertising, both in terms of how it drives decisions, but also rotating the placements we have. And so there's been a lot more science than, I think, in prior years, as people look at advertising.","In terms of the checking product, we are very excited about that. We have been disciplined in terms of ramping it up, just to make sure that we provide the same great customer experience in that product as we do across all of our others. We have some actual radio spots that are in market now, and we're seeing those drive higher search activity. So while it will take some time for this to become a meaningful part of our funding, we're very excited about the product, the differentiation it has, and our ability to grow it.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great, thanks. And, one quick follow-up on the personal loan trajectory. It seems like the fiscal increase in the fourth quarter seems relatively normal and 50 basis points sounds reasonable, or I think a little higher than that, actually, in our model. The 5% for next year is a little higher than I was thinking, and just wondering, can you talk about the seasoning curve, when would that peak in 2019? Towards the first half of the year, hopefully?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, I think that's a reasonable way to model it. At the end of the day, a big driver next year is going to be that denominator effect piece of the puzzle as well, right. So, otherwise, you would see it fall on a stable portfolio, or if you were originating just enough to keep the portfolio flat, you would see it come down a little bit from that 5% level. So, I think the denominator effect will be a piece of it.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","(44:00) Thank you so much.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet","Thank you. First question I wanted to ask is on, Mark, I wanted to follow up on your reserve commentary. We see that the year-over-year growth in your loan loss reserves has been slowing since the third quarter of 2017, and it looks like it's on a path to converging with your loan growth. And it also looks like the year-over-year change in your reserve rate peaked in the third quarter at around 40 basis points, and it's been on a downward trajectory since. So two-part question: first part is, is it reasonable to expect that these trajectories will continue? And then the second part is, if we are indeed, you know, approaching a point where credit headwinds are abating, and these trends hold, and you sustain your industry-leading loan growth and revenue growth, then is it reasonable to conclude that that's going to translate into incremental positive operating leverage, or would you guys reinvest some of that in the business? Just some color around those points would be great. And congratulations, Roger.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","There's a whole bunch.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Bill.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","There's a whole bunch in there, I'm going to try to hit on all of it. Feel free to use your follow-up, to the extent I missed something.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","He already did.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","I think at the end of the day, in response to your first question about the declining rate of increase in the reserve growth, yeah, I think that is directly reflective of the trends we're seeing, as we're approaching that normalized level of losses. So I kind of think about it a little bit like that old calculus class that used to drive me crazy with limit calculations. You just kind of turn it on its side, and your limit curve is approaching the asymptote, and so as that's happening, charge-offs are normalizing, and you're seeing the impact reserve built in the card account, in the card portfolio normalized as well. So I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. The one thing I would remind you, or the couple things I'd remind you in that context is, it will be affected by relative growth rates in loan balances as well, right? So if we get a disproportionate amount of new accounts, or a disproportionate amount of loan balances coming from things that are less seasoned, that would obviously have bearing and could cause hiccups in that and everything. But I think, as a general rule, you're thinking about it the right way.","In terms of operating leverage, in terms of how to think about that, I would pick up on Roger's earlier commentary. Well, first of all, I would say we are very committed as a company to positive operating leverage, so let's put that out there. There is a lot of leverage in the model that we perhaps aren't fully availing ourselves of right now, because we are investing very heavily in that digital and analytics side of the equation that we spoke of, and we're also taking advantage of originating quality accounts while the market is ripe for us to do so. So, I think there's more leverage that exists in the model when we choose to pull those levers. Right now, the levers we're choosing to pull are the investments in the digital and technology investments, because we're seeing tremendous payback on those.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet","Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks guys, for taking my questions. Roger, congratulations.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Rick.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Collectively, we've spent a lot of time over the last year thinking about the profile, the timeline and profile for a cohort of profitability, thinking about growing that cohort, reserving for it, experiencing the losses. You guys are focused now, in part, on growing the portfolio through some promotional balances. I'm curious as we've spent so much time refining our thought process on what that profile looks like, if it will be different, if it's delayed for balances to grow through promotional balances in terms of profitability.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","So I would say it's going to, Rick, depend to some degree on what type of promotional balance you're talking about. Sales promos I would say no, right? So if you're doubling the rewards in the first year for a new card member, those type things, I would say no, those aren't going to have delaying effects and mitigating effects and all those things. Balance transfers, the answer is, it depends on the nature of that balance transfer. If you do a $5,000-line assignment, and somebody transfers $4,995 over the day you do the line assignment, you probably made a mistake. You're probably dealing with somebody who doesn't have incremental borrowing capacity. And you're dealing with a surfer, and so you try and minimize for that to the greatest extent you can under, obviously, fair credit laws, which you're going to comply with at all cost, obviously. So, I'd say that's a piece of the puzzle. The other balance transfers, the more normalized balance transfers, I would say no. There might be a delay by a couple of months but not anything that's dramatically significant or that I would say would affect your modeling in a huge way.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair","Thank you, and Roger, congratulations on outlasting David.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair","The one thing, Roger, that you sounded a little more incrementally excited about for Discover is the growth of the payments business. That did have very nice growth, and there's probably nothing that could help your valuation multiple more than if that became a bigger piece of the pie. And it seems like a significant opportunity to do that with the network that you have. Is there an expectation or a focus incrementally that, on that payments business, on having it become a bigger part of the pie? And would you look at acquisitions? And I know they're expensive in the payment space, but I think even a short-term dilutive, long-term accretive acquisition probably would be well received.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. If you think about payments as a percent of total earnings, we would never slow down the earnings growth on the direct banking side. And you can see, while earnings are growing nicely on the payment side of the business, we're also focused on driving loan growth and growth in profitability on the Direct Banking side, too.","Some of our biggest acquisitions have been on the payment side. So, if you look at PULSE that got us into the debit business, if you look at Diners Club that brought us global acceptance around the world. Both of those were transformational. You know, traditionally we have not done huge-scale acquisitions. So may look at bolt-ons or things that add capabilities. I would echo your comment around valuations on the payment side, but growing that business is a big part of our strategy. We have a unique set of assets. We're really excited about some of the partnerships we have, whether it's working with PayPal, or with Apple, or with networks all around the world. So, it is a key focus of ours.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair","Thank you. My follow-up question, just, on the Student Loan business, there've been a couple businesses, like SoFi or maybe Navient, focusing very aggressively on refinancing the highest-quality borrowers within that portfolio. Is that, are you seeing incremental, an increase in the loan payoff? And is that something that concerns you about being able to grow that business longer-term?","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. So, we are seeing pressure on payment rates from student loan consolidators, and that's having an impact on our loan growth. I wouldn't say it's necessarily impacting charge-offs as much, but really the impact is on the loan growth. We've still been growing at 10% year-over-year. We expect another record year of originations. So, I'd say it's something we're monitoring. It'll be interesting to see how those consolidators do in a rising rate environment, given the amount of fixed rate loans that are out there. So, I'd say something we're watching, we are seeing an impact, but nothing that's changing our overall strategic view on the Student Loan business.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair","Right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good evening.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Betsy.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Betsy.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Congratulations, Roger.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Thanks.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a couple of follow-ups. One, on the NIM outlook, I know that you talked about earlier on the call at the coming in for the full year below the range of 10.3% to 10.4%. Could you just give us a sense as to, that's ever so slightly modestly below because it feels to me like it would be hard to go south of 10.2%, but maybe I'm wrong on that.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, no, no, you'll see accretion in the fourth quarter from the third quarter's level, and the way you're describing it is by far away the right way to think about it, Betsy. It's not going to, you know, we're talking a handful of basis points. We're not talking about below the guidance range, we're not talking a precipitous decline here.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right, thanks. And then, separately, just want to get a little bit of a sense from you on how you think your customers are doing, you know, financially. You know, obviously good loan growth year-to-date, and expecting to continue to have loan growth. So I want to understand, because I know you see your customers' full picture, or pretty close to their full financial picture. Do you see them having a lot more capacity to add on leverage? Do you see them taking the leverage that you provide them with, and, you know, paying down other parts of the stack? And how do you see their cash flows? Maybe give us some color on that.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, so, you know, clearly it's a very robust economic environment. If you look at unemployment, if you look at wage growth starting to come into the marketplace. So given the breadth of our book, that's benefiting our customers as well. In terms of whether that opens up a huge amount of capacity, you know, we've been pretty clear that we've been tightening the credit box over the last couple years, and don't really plan on shifting that focus at this point, given how late we are in the cycle. But, again, we feel good about where our customers are, and that's showing up in the numbers.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, and I would pile on to that, Betsy, and just kind of say one of the things that we watch very closely is obviously not just the overall level of leverage, but as we're also in a rising rate environment, what is the cost of that leverage, right? And one of the things that's somewhat encouraging or maybe, you know, less troubling about the re-levering in the consumer, might be a better way to say it, is the vast majority of that incremental leverage they've put on has been fixed rate. So, unlike going into the crisis when everybody had a giant ARM and when rates started to rise, payments exploded, here, it's principally auto loans, student loans, and personal loans that have driven the bulk of the increase in the leverage since the low point, and all of those that have the combination, could be characteristic of largely being fixed-rate in nature. So while leverage is back to normalized leverage, the rate-carrying implications that are a little better than historically we have seen them. Keeping an eye on it, watching it like a hawk, but right now it feels manageable.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and then, just lastly, CECL, we haven't talked much about that, and I think parallel run starts next year. Is there anything that you would be able to do with regard to the reserve ratio to prepare for that? Or do you just have to wait until 1Q 2020? Maybe give us some color and updates on how you're thinking about that.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, the only way we could do anything would be to early adopt, Betsy, and we are still working through all the modeling activity that we need to be digging through to get ready to implement the standard. We do intend to do parallel runs, we do intend to, at some point next year, start giving you guy's transparency into what we're looking at. Our clear hope at the end of the day is, there has been a growing drumbeat across multiple different industry groups, across many different people for a delay and study approach to CECL. We think there are a number of different quantitative impacts here that just haven't been fully considered. You know, the interaction between CCAR and CECL, or whatever the stress testing for the mid-tiers like ourself is going to be, and CECL, how does that interact? The impact on, you know, the provision of loans into the economy. There's a pro-cyclical element of this sucker that you're going to pull back on extending credit at the beginning of downturns, right, when folks want banks to lend, right? From an SEC standpoint, there's going to be comparability challenges in terms of how you think about, you know, if in our card assumptions, we assume a short, shallow recession two years from now, and Brand X assumes a long, deep recession in 15 months, I don't know how you're going to compare our reserve thoughts to their reserve thoughts, and figure that out. So I really think delay and study is the right answer. We have commented on that, and to the extent those of you on the call think that would make sense as well, we would encourage you to join us and sign on.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I would definitely like to study more. So, no, that's helpful. Appreciate the thoughts there, Mark.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Absolutely. My pleasure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Would also like to add my congratulations to Roger and then I'll turn and pivot and ask Mark a question from your February 2014 Investor Day just for fun. So, Mark.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hopefully I remember it, but go ahead, fire away.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah, exactly yeah. What I figured I would ask is just on the Personal Loan business because I think that was the last time you gave us some disclosure on sort of the complexion of those loans, the average FICA was 750, typical term was three to five years and then 60% of that portfolio had a separate Discover relationship. I was just wondering if in recent years if it still looked pretty much the same particularly on that Discover relationship being the majority of the portfolio for personal loans.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, so it's about 60% of the portfolio still cross sold has a relationship with the, on the credit card side with us as well. The average FICA was right around that 750 level still, so no meaningful upward or downward drift in FICO. In terms of term, the average life we're seeing right now is about two years. We offer three to seven but the average life is running about two years give or take. So I would say on a, actually, and the average life is like 1.8 years, but round it and call it two. So at the end of the day I would say no significant drift in the composition of the portfolio at this point in time broadly.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it, and then another history question for you. I apologize. But just a mix of promotional balances, is that around 19%? That's what it was about a year ago. Just wondering if it's still in that sort of ZIP code.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No, it's up about 1% over the course of the last year, give or take in terms of where it's sitting today.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay, that makes sense to me. Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jill Shea with Citi.","Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good evening. Just on the credit quality side on the card side and the slowing year-over-year growth in net charge offs, could you walk us through the dynamics that you're seeing in the front book versus the back book loss curve? And then could you also provide some color on the performance of the front book vintage years and how they're performing relative to each other?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, we don't provide vintage year disclosure so I'll stay away from that one. What I can say is, if you think about the reserve bill this quarter, Jill, roughly give or take about half of it was result of seasoning of new loan growth and roughly half of it was due to that normalization phenomena with increasing severity as customers have carried more leverage. So that's about what's driving the reserving phenomena and obviously reserving expects what we, is kind of the driver really of kind of what we expect to see coming at us in the future. So that probably gives you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about that. And in terms of the composition then of where we're seeing some of this come from in a different lens, I'd say, roughly let's call it 40% is new account related, two-thirds of the total is back book-related. Now those Venn diagrams aren't mutually exclusive. There's some overlap in there, so don't look at them both, because some of the back book is new loan balances and so there's different pieces of the puzzle there. But I think that probably gives you a pretty good way to think about it.","Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, very helpful.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Bill Ryan with Compass Point.","William Ryan - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up on the promotional balances, last quarter, I think you disclosed it was about 21% of the card book. If you looked a year ago, roughly what was the percentage of promo balances and if you looked at Discover's card book over a long-term period, roughly what percentage of the card book is typically on a type of a promo balance? And second part of that question, I mean, you've been running the double cashback promo for quite a while. Is there any incremental types of promo programs that you're running at this point? Thanks again.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","You bet. So a couple different parts of that. So the promo rates are up 1% over a year ago, so that call it 21%ish number is still the right way to think about it. They were more like 20% a year ago, give or take. Rough math in both cases. We kind of expect to see them flat. As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, we don't expect to see them tick up from here, so we'd expect that even though we're remaining more active in some of these segments than we initially thought we might be that mix will stay flat as far as that goes. In terms of thinking about how that level has varied over time I would say it tends to vary pretty dramatically. As you might imagine, when you see a downturn coming when you're in the middle of a downturn, you don't do a lot of promo activity so that balance falls off pretty meaningfully. When you're at a point in time in the cycle where you see great opportunities to acquire accounts and engage accounts via promotional activity; that tends to tick up. So, we are toward the higher end if you look at the ranges that we've run at from time. We're not at the absolute high, but we're toward, up toward the more upper end of that as opposed to the lower end, given the nature of the environment we're in right now. In terms of the doubles, I would say, no, double continues to be the significant sales promo we're running. We do run other things from time to time. But the real driver of the numbers is going to be the doubles on the sales promotion side, and it's going to be the BT activity as well.","William Ryan - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC","Thank you.","Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services","Absolutely. My pleasure.","Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services","Celisia, we're good. So, thank you, everybody, for your questions, your interest.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2018 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services","Thank you, Sarah. Welcome, everybody, to our call this afternoon. I will begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report, and in our most recent 10-K, which is on the website and on file with the SEC.","In the first quarter 2018 earnings materials, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. And we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call today will include remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, covering first quarter highlights and developments; and Mark Graf, of course, our Chief Financial Officer, who will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation.","After Mark completes his comments, there will be ample time for question-and-answer session. And during the Q&A period, if you don't mind, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David, who'll begin his remarks on page 3 of the presentation.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Craig, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. In the first quarter, we delivered net income of $666 million with earnings per share of $1.82 and the return on equity of 25%. Very solid performance, which reflects our success in driving outstanding growth in receivables, pre-provisioned net revenue and shareholder returns.","Our strong profitability is the result of consistent execution of our Direct Banking strategy, buoyed by positive macroeconomic conditions. The environment for prime consumers remains healthy, supported by a robust labor market and rising home prices, both important indicators of credit performance on our target segment.","In addition, data suggests that U.S. consumers generally continue to feel positive about future prospects for their personal finances. We believe our positive business momentum will continue to be supported by the growing economy and higher take-home pay as a result of tax reform.","Credit performance across the industry continues to normalize after several years of historically very low net charge-off rates, including in our portfolio. This trend has been driven by the increase in supply of credit from lenders and greater usage of credit by consumers. Against the backdrop of low unemployment, rising wages and lower consumer tax burdens, we view recent credit performance as the natural result of this greater availability of consumer credit and not as the first sign of a downturn.","The other factor playing a role in higher provisions is the seasoning of our loan growth, as recent vintages make up a larger percentage of our portfolio. These vintages are performing in line with our expectations, and we will continue to pursue quality loan growth because the economic and competitive environment remains conducive to creating long-term shareholder value.","Receivables grew 9% in the first quarter led by strong growth in the card business. Card loan growth continues to come from a balanced mix of new accounts and existing customers, and is supported by sales growth acceleration. The origin of sales growth includes strong customer acquisition, low attrition and economic growth. It is clear that the Discover brand as well as the features and benefits of our card continue to resonate with consumers, driving growth in new account acquisitions.","Our consistent focus on prime revolvers and discipline in pricing and rewards drove 10% revenue growth in the first quarter. Operating expenses also rose as we continued to invest both for growth and an enhanced customer experience, as well as to advance our analytical capabilities. Our efficient operating model helped keep expense growth lower than revenue growth, driving positive operating leverage again this quarter.","In Payment Services, our PULSE, Diners Club and Network Partners businesses, each delivered double-digit increases in volume. I'm pleased that volume for the segment was up 19% year-over-year, which drove a healthy increase in revenue while prudent expense management held operating expenses flat.","Before I turn over the call to Mark, I want to take a minute to highlight an initiative that we believe is an important element in our long-term strategy. In February, we announced our new debit rewards program for our Cashback Checking product. This program allows our checking customers to earn 1% cashback and up to $3,000 of eligible debit card purchases each month.","Despite only minimal promotion to-date, the checking product has received a positive reception in the market, particularly among millennials with an average age of 35 for new checking account customers in the first quarter.","Importantly, for more than 40% of the new checking accounts opened in the first quarter, this represents the customers' first relationship with Discover. This demonstrates the checking product's potential to serve as an important new entry point to the Discover franchise.","In summary, our consistent focus on the customer, good momentum across our businesses and favorable economic conditions continue to drive strong risk-adjusted returns.","Now I'll ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. Looking at key elements of the income statement, our 10% revenue growth in the first quarter was driven primarily by a combination of strong loan growth and margin expansion. The increase in provision is largely consistent with ongoing supply-driven normalization in the consumer credit industry as well as the seasoning of our last several years of loan growth. Operating expenses rose 9% year-over-year as a result of investments to support growth and new capabilities.","Turning to slide 5. Total loans increased 9% over the prior year, the result of a 10% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise revolving balances drove much of this increase, spurred by stronger sales growth from both revolvers and transactors. Promotional balances were a more modest contributor to our strong performance.","Looking forward, we believe that the first quarter will represent the high watermark for receivables growth. This is due to a combination of tougher comparisons, the continued slowdown in personal loan originations and our expectation for lower balance transfer activity in card.","Looking at our other primary lending products, year-over-year growth in personal loans slowed to 10%. Private student loan balances rose 3% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 11% year-over-year.","Moving to the results from our payments network, on the right-hand side of slide 5, you can see the proprietary volume rose 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in active Discover card accounts.","In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume growth continued to increase, with 20% higher volume compared to the prior year as a result of merchant and acquirer routing decisions as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Diners Club volume rose 14% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises and Network Partners volume increased 24%, driven by AribaPay volume.","Moving to revenue on slide 6. Net interest income increased $208 million or 11% from a year ago, driven by a combination of higher loan balances, market rates and our balance sheet positioning.","Total non-interest income was up $28 million, driven by Discover card sales volume, which grew 6% this quarter, despite a smaller number of processing days when compared to 2017. If we adjust for the number of processing days, sales growth would be closer to 8%.","As shown on slide 7, our net interest margin rose 16 basis points from the prior year and was down 5 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 10.23%. Relative to the first quarter of last year, the net benefit of a higher prime rate and a favorable shift in funding mix were partially offset by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge-offs. Relative to the fourth quarter, the net benefit of a higher prime rate was more than offset by higher interest charge-offs, as well as some minor shifts in portfolio and funding mix.","Total loan yield increased 27 basis points from a year ago to 12.21%, resulting from a 20-basis-point increase in card yield and a 60-basis-point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases, partially offset by the impact of somewhat larger promotional balances and higher charge-offs, drove card yields higher. Higher short-term interest rates drove the increase in student loan yields.","On the liability side of the balance sheet, we once again generated robust growth in our consumer deposits, which ended the quarter above $40 billion. Consumer deposit rates rose during the first quarter, increasing 15 basis points sequentially and 34 basis points year-over-year. As one would expect, as we get further into a rising rate cycle, deposit betas are rising, and we expect that trend will continue in 2018.","Turning to slide 8, operating expenses rose $83 million from the prior year. Employee compensation and benefits was higher, the result of increased head count to support business growth and higher average salaries. Marketing expenses were up as a result of higher account acquisition costs and increased brand advertising. Other expenses also grew as we increased our philanthropic commitments.","I'll now discuss credit results on slide 9. Total net charge-offs rose 49 basis points from the prior year and 24 basis points sequentially. As we've talked about over the last year, supply-driven credit normalization, along with the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years, have been the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs.","Credit card net charge-offs rose 48 basis points year-over-year, with this quarter representing the second consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge-offs. I'm also pleased to say that for the month of April, we've seen improving credit performance showing up both in payment rate as well as delinquency formation.","Personal loan net charge-offs increased 87 basis points from the prior year and 41 basis points sequentially. As we indicated last year, we stopped booking loans in several segments of the broad market personal loan book that were not performing in line with our expectations.","Losses on these segments continue to rise as the loans season, but the performance of the rest of the portfolio is consistent with our expectations. Remaining incremental exposure over the lives of the loans in the discontinued segments is expected to be approximately $20 million. Private student loan net charge-offs rose 32 basis points year-over-year and fell 11 basis points sequentially.","Total company 30-plus-day delinquency rates were largely flat sequentially and up 26 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This increase is fairly consistent across credit cards, student loans and personal loans, and is similar to what we saw in the second half of 2017. As with net charge-offs, increasing delinquencies are driven by normalization and seasoning.","Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 30 basis points sequentially as loan balances declined. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 120%.","Before I move on, I want to say a few words about capital stress testing. As you remember, last month, the Federal Reserve announced that it was introducing a new model that would likely increase stress losses on credit card receivables. In addition, this year's CCAR process incorporates both a more severe stress scenario as well as the impact of tax reform on stress capital consumption.","These factors were taken into account in our recent capital plan submission, and while we can't provide specifics prior to receiving regulatory feedback, realistically speaking, we expect the payout for the next CCAR cycle to be somewhat below 100%.","To sum up the quarter on slide 11, we generated 9% total loan growth and an overall 25% return on equity, with significant contributions from all three of our primary lending products. Our consumer deposit business posted equally strong growth of 10%, while deposit rates increased 34 basis points year-over-year.","With respect to credit, while our charge-off rates have risen as credit conditions normalize and loans season, they remain consistent with our expectations as well as our return targets. And we are continuing to execute on our capital plan, with strong loan growth and a leading payout ratio helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels.","In conclusion, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and are confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. That concludes our formal remarks.","So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Sarah, to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. And your first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Sanjay, are you there?","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. I'm sorry about that, I was on mute. Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No worries.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","First question is around credit quality. Thanks for all the color. Mark, intra-quarter, you talked about the provision being a little bit higher than the consensus estimate for the first quarter.","As you look out for the remainder of the year and considering some of the comments you had on the April statistics, I mean, do you think the provisions are appropriate across the Street? And then maybe just specific to the April numbers, relative to the guidance that you've given for the year in terms of the charge-off rate, does that favorably influence that range? Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Absolutely. So, Sanjay, I would say with respect to provision, we don't typically guide provision. The only reason we made those comments at your conference actually back in January was we saw folks coming in a little bit high. I guess what I would say is if we saw a need as models come out for the next quarter to adjust provision guidance, we'll give a soft nudge then at that point in time.","But, right now, I guess what I would say is we feel very good about that 2018 charge-off guidance that we did give at the beginning of the year of 3% to 3.25%, and all the performance continues to be in line with those expectations.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And I guess on CCAR as a follow-up, the little under 100% that you mentioned, do you feel like that fully contemplates the spirit of what the Fed is suggesting across all the data points we have on what they've said about the new models? Or is there some variability to what that might end up being after the process and what you might be able to do there?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","I think it's fair to say there clearly could be some variability. We don't have insight into exactly what the Fed's new model shows. I think that letter, you guys all had a chance to see it, it was a public record document. It just said it's going to produce materially higher losses. We have no way to calibrate, Sanjay, whether materially higher is 10% higher or 30% higher, right?","So I think we took a very thoughtful approach to how we worked our way through it, and my comments today reflect the spirit of our submission. How it actually works its way through the Fed, we'll have to wait and see.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. Mark, you had kind of pointed out that you thought that the first quarter would be the best quarter for growth and outlined some of the reasons.","Maybe if you flip that around and talk a little bit about the competitive environment, what other things might be going on and how you think about that and also your use of promo rates in that and how you're kind of thinking about that for the balance of the year?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. So, this is David. Maybe I'll kick off and Mark maybe want to add something. I think if you look over the last couple of years, two years ago, our growth slowed a bit more because there were some competitors who were really aggressive and we saw some maybe fewer profitable opportunities. We talked last year about the fact that some of those competitors pulled back, and that allowed us to put up accelerated growth.","This year, I'm seeing that it's starting off feeling a lot like last year in terms of the competitive environment. Competitive but not overly-competitive, not crazy, not as many crazy offers out there. But we're now looking back over a comparable period where we had high growth.","So I think if you look at the guidance we gave for the year of 7% to 9%, this quarter, we were actually a little bit above that. So I think, consistent with that guidance, we expect that as we continue to see great opportunities to grow value and profitability, that's allowing us to put on really good growth. But the year-over-year change, we would expect to fall somewhat, but at least maybe into the range of the 7% to 9% that we guided.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. Moshe, what I'd tack on to that would be a couple of things. And I guess, number one, really underscore David's earlier point about our approach to growth really hasn't changed over the last number of years. It's really just competitors surging and then pulling back and other things that have impacted the rate of growth because we stayed consistent in the return thresholds we look for and what we'll actually book. So it's a pullback of others that has allowed our growth rates to rebound a little bit.","But I think the tougher comps that I referenced earlier to, our growth rate really accelerated as a result of that pullback through 2017. I think also the pullback in the DPL originations that we have talked about a few different times will have a meaningful impact on that overall loan growth as well.","So I wouldn't expect \u2013 we're not calling out that we expect loan growth to fall dramatically. I think we're just kind of saying, what's on the margin, it's probably going to be somewhat lower as we look forward than what we're looking at right now.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And maybe to kind of relate that to the fact that you had positive operating leverage with 9% expense growth, which is a pretty good feat. How do you think about expense growth in that context for the balance of the year?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. I mean, I think at the end of the day, expense growth, Moshe, is really a function of business growth. And it's naturally going to fluctuate as we invest in the business and look for ways to capitalize on great growth opportunities as we see them.","And we've talked in the past, there's tremendous leverage in the model in marketing costs and absolute levels of marketing, a lots of different levers that when you hit an environment where really shifting to focus on pulling back on expenses as opposed to building a franchise makes sense, we feel very comfortable in our ability to do that.","So I think it's a conscious decision, long story short, that got us to the 9% growth. And I wouldn't think about all that as impressed run rate kind of numbers. It's conscious decision-making quarter-over-quarter.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good evening, Mark. So the NIM was down a little bit Q-over-Q. I assume that the full-year 2018 guidance still holds. I think it was 10.3% to 10.4%.","And then can you talk a little bit about the card yield progression? It sounds like credit was a factor on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but would you expect to see that sort of pop a little bit more?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. In terms of the full-year guide, Don, I would say if we kind of saw a need to revise that guidance, we'd revise the guidance. So I wouldn't worry about that one. I would say, in terms of quarter on a sequential basis, I would say what we said is expect about 7 to 8 basis points of upside from every 25 basis points that hike. And based on our asset-sensitive positioning, I would say that is consistent with what we saw this quarter.","I think sometimes you will forget there's a seasonal uptick in charge-offs in the first quarter. So, that really kind of increases your revenue suppression. We also saw a little bit of an increase in promotional balance mix this quarter. And I think you heard me say in our prepared remarks, we're going to see a little less promotional growth in the mix going forward.","So I think those two things really combined to offset the goodness that we saw on the rate side. Feel good about our continued positioning. Think again about the comments we made in what we're seeing around credit in the month of April. So, again, if we saw a need to revise that NIM guidance, we would have revised it.","Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just a clarification. I know CCAR doesn't incorporate CECL, but are you sort of thinking about that as you set your payout ratio or your capital level today?","And do you have any initial thoughts? I mean, obviously, there'll be some impact to the card lenders. Do you have any sort of commentary on how we should be thinking about that at this point?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. No, I mean, it's preliminary. We're working our own way through it at this point in time, Don. I guess what we have said is, make no mistake, reserves will go up in a seasonal environment, given our product and our business mix, right? So I think that's definitely the case.","I think the thing I'd remind everybody is it really affects accounting earnings. It doesn't really affect cash flows the same way. And so, if you think about it from a held-to-maturity perspective, the economics of our portfolio don't change one iota from pre-implementation to post-implementation.","So I think sometimes it's a little bit of rearranging vectors. That having been said, it's a very complex rearranging of vectors, and there's a number of issues we're still trying to get our arms around such as how do you define the life of a card well, right? Do you do on a FIFO basis where the first dollar borrowed is the first dollar repaid? Do you think about it in a CARD Act hierarchy? How do you think about it? So I think there's a lot of work needs to be done defining those things.","So, clearly, reserves will go up under CECL. And it's clearly our intent, as we have a good sense of where that's going to be, we obviously will telegraph that to you guys. It's preliminary at this point, though.","Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Mark.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the trend and rewards costs. I know it ticked down a bit this quarter. And are you still expecting maybe in that 128 to 130 range in terms of basis points as you look out for the year? Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. I think that's the way to think about it. Again, if we had felt the need to revise guidance, we'd be doing that. To the extent you're looking at year-over-year and wondering about that, I think the big change is \u2013 it is up year-over-year, a big chunk of that is we ran gas in the first quarter as one of our 5% rotating categories.","Whenever you run gas, it's extremely attractive to people, and they jump on that. So I'd say that would really explain the year-over-year number. But full year, we feel very good about that earlier guidance.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I figured that was the year-over-year driver. And then, separately, and just getting back to the receivables growth discussion again, I hear you about the potential ticking back a little bit or moderating a bit. Are you seeing any signs yet just in terms of the transaction volumes and card volumes, around any pickup in spending that's evidenced with your customers post tax reform? Is that something that's clearly becoming evident? Thanks.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, so it's David. I would say that the number of days in the quarter processing skewed our numbers a little. If you look at it like-for-like days, we had about 8% year-over-year growth in volume for the first quarter, which was stronger than it's been in the past.","Now I can't say yet if that is attributable to tax reform or whether it's just attributable to our value proposition and us gaining share, because some of the retail reports I've seen have not suggested so much of a pickup yet in the first quarter.","I do think that, given that some of the withholding has just kicked in, in the last six or eight weeks for people, that people are going to do one of two things with a couple of percent extra money in their pocket. They're either going to save it more or they're going to spend it. And I suspect consumers will do some of each.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Got it. Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good evening, guys.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Ryan.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Mark. David, maybe just to follow up on, I think, the comments that Mark had made regarding promotional balances. I know this is a channel that historically you guys have come in and out of. Can you maybe just talk about competitively what you're seeing there that's causing us to potentially see some slowing growth in that channel?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, I think he mentioned specifically balance transfer pulling back a bit. And one of the factors is obviously the economics changed a little bit just with the higher interest rates.","And also, we're constantly adjusting our models. We use promotional rates to drive better profitability. If it's cheaper to invest in promo rates than higher marketing costs, we look at that as almost another marketing costs, if you will.","So I wouldn't say \u2013 we don't tend to go guardrail to guardrail on anything, but we're always making adjustments as we review the data and find opportunities.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And Mark, maybe I can ask Sanjay's question a little bit of a different way, given that we needed your assistance to get us into the right place for the first quarter.","I guess when I think about what's transpired over the last couple of quarters, the reserve as of the end of the year was running about 40 basis points above last year's charge-off level. Given that you're growing at a nice clip, but delinquencies are increasing at a stable to improving pace, you highlighted what's been happening with charge-offs, would you expect us to start to see more convergence between charge-offs and the reserve level? Or given the normalization that's going on, would you expect that gap to kind of remain in a similar range I guess it's been the last couple of quarters? Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. I got to be really careful with that one, Ryan, because that could be back \u2013 you can back into provision guidance on that one, so I'm going to be careful.","How about if I tackle it a little differently and just kind of say, from my perspective, we continue to feel really good about the way credit is seasoning. If you look at it this quarter, it's about 40% driven by the seasoning of new accounts. It's about 60% to normalization on the back book. Roughly speaking, that continues to be in line with our expectation. It also continues to be in accordance with all of the return metrics under which we're underwriting this credit.","So we feel very good about the nature of the credit we're putting on the books. We talked the last quarter about potentially directing some incremental growth dollars towards some segments. We haven't fully deployed all that at this point in time. And at the end of the day, we may not end up fully deploying all of it. Just to be clear, if we can't find risk-adjusted returns and ways to deploy that that are consistent with our models, right? Again, we're not going to bend from the discipline in terms of how we grow.","So, continue to feel really good about what we're putting on the books, continue to feel very good about the trajectory of credit. Appreciate your comment about delinquency rates basically, 27, 24, 27 basis points, I think up the last couple quarters. They've really flattened out to a large degree, and we feel good about where we are.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I appreciate all the color, Mark. Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. David, to what extent do you attribute kind of the above-industry receivables growth to the Cashback Match offer, which really was kind of unique in that it provided an upfront incentive to encourage a customer to engage for a full year rather than three months?","And what impact, if any, do you think you'll see on that growth with probably one of the most direct competitors, the Freedom Unlimited, effectively matching that in the last week?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, Mark, I think that it's a combination of differentiating features and strong execution that have allowed us to grow faster than the industry average the last year-and-a-half or so in particular.","Certainly, Cashback Match is one of those things, but Social Security numbers on the dark web and on\/off freeze functionality and the fact that we have our own brand at point-of-sale that is differentiating from the Visa-Mastercard issuers, one of which you mentioned. Yeah, I think it's the cumulative impact of a bunch of stuff. It's no one thing.","I guess the second thing I would say is imitation is flattery, but this is, while an important competitor, it's one program. It'll be X percentage of total marketing that we're up against. And overall, we think the package that we offer is what's attractive to consumers versus any one thing, even Match.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And the second question, David, are you prepared at all yet to comment on kind of what your expectations and objectives are for growing the new checking product over the next couple years?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","I'm sorry. You said the \u2013 you asked about the \u2013 what you could expect in checking for the next two years?","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The new checking product that you guys \u2013 yeah.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","We're really excited by it, but I think it's going to be a gradual build because this is a long-term play. By nature, checking accounts tend to be sticky. It's what makes them attractive to financial institutions. But that means we'll probably ease into it and focus on testing new things.","We're going to be adding some more features mid-year this year. I expect the second half of this year to have more promotional activity than we had the first half of this year. But to put a point on it, I'm not sure you'll see a TV ad in the second half of the year.","But we think that, you know, we're going to report our progress as it becomes more material. But I think you should think about over, say, a 5-year period this sort of turning into something material in terms of first-time customers, lower cost funding, stickier relationships, and we're starting off to increase the franchise.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Betsy.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Couple of follow-ups. One on capital. I know you mentioned somewhat below 100%, and I'm sure, Mark, you're not going to tell us what that's defined as numerically. But maybe you can help me understand, is somewhat more or less than modestly?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Maybe you could ask the Fed for us, Betsy.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Look, I think, Betsy, one of the things we talked about earlier was in the first quarter when we saw provisions coming in a little bit high in sort of some of the models, we gave a little bit of a nudge just to make sure that folks kind of recalibrated.","I guess, really sort of what we're trying to do in part based on what we're saying here is that for those folks who are thinking in their modeling currently something north of 100%, maybe the thought process is removing the thought of north of 100% more so than it is how much below 100% should you be. How about that?","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, as I'm thinking about that, is there anything you can tell us with regard to dividend versus buyback? Like, does it make more sense to keep the divi flat and not flex the buyback as much? Or do you want to see that growth in dividend year-in, year-out and flex it in the buyback?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So I would say I think we've been pretty consistent over the last four or five years that we do have a goal of being an S&P Dividend Achiever. That requires dividend increases. I wouldn't change or dissuade anybody from thinking that remains a piece of our thought process.","That being said, the magnitude of increases can vary, obviously, too. So, as we went through our submission, we looked and we recalibrated some of those things. And in terms of exact detail, we'll have to wait until we get results back from the Fed and we can share it with you then.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom from UBS. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Just a couple more questions about provision. I know it's a topic we've labored over. But first, Mark, historically, March or April has tended to be a low for credit experience just because people use tax refunds and things to get a little bit caught up and that kind of thing.","Is that something that you continue to expect to be true? Or is something changing in terms of the seasonal nature of losses?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No. I think there's definitely the tax refund impact that comes in. I would say they're delayed a little bit this year is one thing to keep in mind. And the other thing I would point out in this construct, it's not \u2013 I want to be abundantly clear, we don't have data that supports causality.","But simply, correlation, we saw a pretty significant improvement in our payment rates and in our delinquency trends start at the very week when the payroll processors adjusted withholdings.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Got it.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So I do think there's something going on here as we talked earlier briefly with that additional discretionary income that folks have seen as well.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. And then just in terms of \u2013 I know this has been asked a couple of different ways, but I just want to make sure I'm fully understanding how to reflect your commentary about growth in terms of the provision as well. So, all else equal, if growth is tailing a little bit, I recognize that you're talking about a moderate extent, but if growth is tailing a little bit, would that, all else equal, suggest that the provision increment should also be diminishing in line?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","I would say in an all-else-equal environment, yes, with one exception, and that there is a lag associated with that portion of the reserve build that is associated with the growth in new accounts, right? So, if you think about the way a new account seasons, it takes peak season in 24 months after you originate it. So, if it's growth that I put on the books today, I don't have a lot of reserves set up for that yet. That'll come as we roll forward on the calendar. So, yes, but with a modest lag.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. A question around MDR. If my calculation is correct, I see a 4 to 5 basis point improvement year-on-year. Can you just talk about what's driving it and how should we think about that going forward?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So the big driver there, Ashish, is going to be the mix of merchants. Particularly, quarter-over-quarter, the fourth quarter's heavy spend at big-box type retailers and larger online retailers that typically tend to have lower discount rates.","As you move into the fourth quarter, the spend mix shifts more balanced. It's not as heavily concentrated in the big ones. So, that tends to drive a little bit of an uptick in the MDR.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I think that's helpful. Because I also saw it on a year-on-year basis, so that was positively surprising. So, that was positive. So just maybe on...","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Just the one thing I would caution on is that I think that it's more likely that that could have modest pressure over time.","The merchant discount rates in general have had some upward pressure as there's been a mix movement towards more card-not-present. But some of the card-not-present merchants are getting much better at anti-fraud kind of capabilities and are able to then earn somewhat lower discount rates.","So I would just be cautious not to extrapolate that increase.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up. On the funding side, the securitized borrowing in particular, that showed a 24-basis-point sequential increase in rate from 2.19% to 2. 43%. I was just wondering if there's any particular call out there and how we should think about those rates going forward.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No. I would say it's just a function of maturities rolling off that were put on several years ago being replaced by new issuances. Some of those new issuances being fixed rate and further out the curve. So I wouldn't think about it as anything other than just positioning the balance sheet the way we want to see it going forward.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. That's helpful.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My name must be the easiest to actually pronounce.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","You and Ryan.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. The question also relates to credit. And I want to square a few things here that have been said both this evening and as well as in prior calls. But I understand you've got a healthy consumer and there's plenty of confidence in the consumer remaining strong for a variety of reasons.","You've noted that you've got seasoning in the normalization of credit impacting credit results, which I guess kind of given the nature of the beast, you've kind of pointed to supply availability as being one of the big drivers of that and you seem to be one of the marginal providers of credit.","So I guess I'm a little kind of questioning as to whether the results that you're going to see in the future actually do kind of live up to your expectations, just given that your loss rates are actually higher across the board on a year-over-year basis than anybody else in the sector.","So it seems that things are changing here a little bit more quickly. So, if you could just help us understand kind of that vector that would be quite helpful.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, I guess if you look at the data, we have had somewhat of a higher increase than some others because we were the lowest of the players. And I'd say that if you look at the prime related large issuers, it's actually very tight now. And I think that of the four big prime issuers, we're all within about 10 or 20 basis points, which is the closest we've been in years.","And so, when we talk about normalization, I think some of the other players had to normalize from abnormally high things, charge-offs, as they continue to work off the problems of pre-downturn loose credit, whereas we have the benefit of having a very fantastic credit.","But we're at a range where being in the low-3% charge-off rate for a prime credit card is great and our underwriting assumptions assume higher than that through the cycle. And so the way I think about it is, if we had expected to be close to 2% charge-off rates indefinitely, we would have been leaving a lot of money on the table and would have been under-extending credit.","So, to me, this is kind of a more natural move. Yes, it's painful because we have to put up those resources that we had to be release on the way down. And I do expect if unemployment rate stays at 4%, housing prices continue to rise, everything continues to be nice, that things ought to stabilize here at some sort of new normal rate level. And what we're seeing so far is consistent with that.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And would you be willing to share what the tenure of the charge-off accounts are? Are these new accounts that have been acquired that just didn't work out? Or are these somewhat aged that are being charged off after being long-term customers? Can you give us some sense as to the nature of the charge-offs?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Ken. Maybe the best way to think about it, as I said, if you think about the reserve build, 40% of it was related to new accounts, 60% of it was related to the back book. So I think that's already been asked and answered.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. First question for me just on the comment you made, Mark, about that compensation and any growth there will be a function of growth elsewhere in the business. Are you feeling any pressure on the compliance side to bring in more people or increase salaries there? Or sort of have we reached the end of that process or even are we at a place where we think we'd see some shrinkage in some compliance related and consultant-like spending?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. I would say I wouldn't attribute the increase in the 9% year-over-year growth to compensation. I would say the vast majority of the increase would be coming in other categories more broadly.","Compensation in and of itself was a chunk of it. I would say that was more broad-based across the company as opposed to really being focused in the regulatory side of the equation. I do believe we are encouraged by what we see being discussed in Washington on tiering and failing in regulatory reform. We do believe that there's sincerity in Washington that folks really want to advance and move this forward.","To this point in time, I would say we've seen glimmers, but think about this, your CCAR where I think we just telegraphed, so it's a tougher CCAR this year than we've seen in years past. So what I would say is, right now, it feels like we're in that awkward period of time where the pendulum on the grandfather clock is swinging and it hangs there for a second before it swings the other way.","So I would think about compliance spend really as being more stable now as opposed to being on either an increasing or a decreasing trend.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And I might add more broadly that we're pleased to be at around 38% efficiency ratio, pleased that again we've been achieving positive operating leverage, growing expenses faster than revenues. And that operating leverage being one of the best in the industry doesn't mean that we don't have other opportunities to maybe over a multiple year period to push that a little bit lower.","And I think compliance-related expenses, can we automate some things and can we mature some things, regardless of any regulatory changes that may or may not happen, we view as an opportunity. But artificial intelligence, technology, there's a lot of \u2013 our direct business model does lend itself to really taking advantage of new technologies to drive more and more efficiencies. And so we're focused on that.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then, just thinking about one of the conversations earlier in the call about how competition affects your growth rate in loans and thinking about the 10% year-on-year growth in credit card loans this quarter. Can you give us a little commentary around the actions you \u2013 like, when did you take the actions that generated that 10% growth? Because I think about some of the issues with Discover it that ultimately caused spending and then caused loan growth.","Some of these things seem like they're multi-year efforts that result in loans now and then some are like balance transfers that are more near-term. Anyway, you guys are always striking a balance. Can you just give us some comments on your thoughts there?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. I'll take the first stab and then David can pile on. I guess I'd start by reminding you that one of the things we said is we really haven't changed over the course of the last several years our approach to the business.","We were willing to underwrite to a loss rate that is higher than where we are today, that continues to be the case, with a certain cost to acquire the account, and then think of that card acquisition model like an NPV calculation essentially is how you think about it. And I think we said before, we target a return that's greater than the return on the buyback program, plus a risk premium, plus a credit premium. And then we also want to see break-evens generally speaking inside of five years, right?","So, that's the rubric we have used going back for a number of years now. And what we saw is if you go back four years ago, I might be off by a year or so, we were outgrowing the prime market by about 400 basis points using that same general rubric. Then others came back into the market surging or just consistently back in the market in the case of some players.","What we saw is they were willing to pay acquisition costs we weren't willing to pay. So, candidly, our growth rates fell not because we chose to peel back on growth, just because others were willing to pay more to get the accounts. Now that those others have backed out of the market more, what you see is that same underwriting model is producing the higher levels of growth. So I wouldn't think about it as so much what we're doing differently as opposed to really the market dynamic itself has shifted.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And I would say that's essentially what I was going to say. I would just summarize that we tend to be consistent, but we are impacted by less consistent competitors.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Thanks very much.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler from Buckingham. Please go ahead.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Mark, looking at the card yield up about 20 basis points year-over-year. Can you help me think about the factors that are weighing on that? I feel like there's a little bit of a missing link between the increase in the prime rate and the increase in your card yield. I understand there's some mix issues, also interest charge-offs.","I guess the one piece I don't know is to the extent that consumers are paying off their balances more in full as you shift more into a spend-centric model with some of your advertising. Is that a big factor? Is there anything else I'm missing?","And a related question, as the promotional activity fades a little bit as you discussed and also potentially charge-offs level off, can we see that card yield do a little better in the second half of the year? Thanks.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, so I'm not going to prognosticate on the card yield trajectory, but I'll go ahead and talk about the bits and pieces that have affected it heretofore. I think you are correct, there is an element of charge-offs of accrued interest that are flowing through there that are a piece of it. And I think you've seen the uptick in charge-offs over the course of the last year. A piece of that, obviously, is going to be mirrored on the interest and fees side of the equation.","Promotional balances, the other component you called out, promotional balances right now are sitting at about 21% of the total book. That's not all balance transfers. Some of that is other things as well. Those balance transfers obviously have an impact though, because they carry a yield which is equivalent to the fee being accreted into yield over the life of the BT if there's a fee associated with it. 0% all the way if there isn't. So, that higher level of promotional activity has had some muting effect as well.","I would say those would be really the two big pieces. And then, of course, you have the piece of the book that's just transactors, right? So you're not going to see the transactors. The bigger your transactor book is, obviously the more of a muting effect that has on your overall card yield in the book, as those books don't revolve. So those would really be the component parts and pieces.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. An unrelated follow-up question. Really excited about this deposit product; it seems like it could be a little of a game-changer for the company. What's the hesitation? It doesn't seem like there's a lot of risk from a credit perspective on doing more of a fuller roll-out of a checking product. Why the caution on rolling out what could be a pretty unique differentiated product in today's market?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, I would just say, while there's not credit risk, there's certainly fraud risk, and so we have to be cautious there. And secondly, the traditional distribution for checking accounts has been branches. And I think that consumers increasingly will acquire their checking accounts in a digital fashion, but we are a pioneer in that. And so I believe that as a pioneer, it will take time to literally change consumer behavior in the country.","But long-term, I believe we're best positioned of anyone I can think of to revolutionize that, but I think it will take time.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. A question on the Payments businesses. The PULSE and the Network Partners continue to show strong growth. And the net income in that segment, you mentioned some things for the $45 million. Is that a real number; a sustainable number? I mean, it was a pretty significant increase over the trend.","And what is your outlook for the growth of those businesses? Do you want payments, now that you have some momentum, to become a much bigger part of the business over time?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So I'll speak to the numbers themselves, and David can speak to division for payments here. I guess what I would say, Bob, is I feel good about the numbers. I feel good about the trajectory of the numbers that we're looking at at this point in time. The PULSE put up some very strong growth.","In that particular case, I would say there were no particular elephants who presented, you know, no giant wins in the quarter or anything like that that really drove that growth. It was far more granular across the board in our traditional marketplace of smaller FIs and some mid-tier FIs as well.","So I would say, feel very good about what the team has done there. I would say the AribaPay volume continues to pick up nicely, feel very good about the trajectory we've got there as well.","So, if I think about the business more broadly, it feels like there's a number of things that are really beginning to fire on a number of different cylinders and it really feels like we've turned the corner from a couple years ago when we were facing what we thought were some pretty anti-competitive actions on the part of some of our competitors.","And David, do you want to speak to the division?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And I would just say that I'm not sure I, you know, 19% growth is awesome, but hard to maintain for very long. But if we can maintain 10%-plus double-digit growth, we did that in the early years of PULSE, and I'm glad we're back in double-digits.","And I would just say that we are looking very hard at opportunities in the U.S. and around the world to really capitalize on this very scarce and, in our view, very valuable network that has the ability to scale to a whole lot more volume. But most of that volume today is locked up by Visa and Mastercard, and we're looking for non-traditional ways to unlock it.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","The Ariba business, I mean is that the B2B payments business, are there other partners? I mean that is a massive market. I'm not sure if you're looking to become a much bigger player in the B2B payments market or not, but AribaPay, I mean it's nice, it's one partner, and it's starting to be some real volume. But what is the rest of the game plan in that business?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","I'd say that Ariba is just one of the places that we're placing bets. We're seeing some continued good volume growth, but it is a very skinny margin business. So I would not say that we're staking our whole payment strategy on AribaPay or it's taking our strategy on placing a bunch of bets.","I'd say the one that I would point out is the net-to-nets. We're up to about 14 global players that we partnered with and we continue to sign a few more every year. And in the long-term, the nice thing about that is it comes with some cross-border business. And as you know, that is the highest margin business in payments. And so it's maybe a little easier for me to see us monetizing and having that contribute to the profit sitting here right now today than what I would say on AribaPay. But we'll keep looking at AribaPay.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jill Shea from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks so much for taking my question. Just following up on CECL, realizing that there's a lot of moving parts and it's still in proposed form, could you touch on your view then potential implications that you saw on regulatory capital ratios? Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. So it's hard to know what the impact of the ratio is going to be until we know what the absolute impact on the reserve level is going to be because, obviously, that initial hit is going to not be a P&L event, it's going to be a capital hit as you adopt CECL.","So what I would say is the regulators did come out and make a statement that I think it might have been that they're leaning toward \u2013 I'm sorry not as they're leaning towards, they actually have agreed now to allow for a three-year phase-in of the regulatory capital impact to CECL. So, that obviously eases the transition there to the extent the numbers are large.","But I would say that really being able to triangulate more on the reg cap impact itself requires us to be able to triangulate more on the absolute magnitude of the delta in reserves that I think we're still working through a number of issues.","Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","So, looks like there may be no more questions? Am I right about that?","Operator","Yes. There are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin. You may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin as always with slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com. ","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. ","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our 10-K, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the first quarter 2015 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Mark Graf, our chief financial officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. ","During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David Nelms","Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For the first quarter, we delivered net income of $586 million, earnings per share of $1.28, and a return on equity of 21%. Our direct banking business continues to deliver solid results. ","Discover achieved a total loan growth of 6% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in card loans, personal loans, and private student loans. Specifically, we grew card receivables by just over 5%, at the upper end of our targeted range. Card sales volume for the quarter was up 3%. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 5%. ","Our growth continues to be driven by a combination of wallet share gains with existing customers and from new accounts. Our Discover it product continues to attract customers as we innovate and offer new industry leading features such as our recently announced Freeze It capability, which allows card members to temporarily suspend their accounts in the event a card is misplaced.","In the quarter, we also launched our new Discover it Miles card. We believe this card will appeal to a different segment of our target market, prime revolvers who value travel rewards. This card leverages our Discover it platform with all of its innovative customer features to offer a unique value proposition in a crowded market. It will take time to become a meaningful portion of our new accounts, but we\u2019re optimistic about the long term value it will generate. ","Our other direct lending products also continue to perform well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 20% and personal loans grew 18% over the prior year. Focused on our payments business, total volume for the segment was flat, as increases in our proprietary volume and growth in our business to business volume offset year over year declines at Pulse. ","On a reported basis, Diners volume was down 1%. However, adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange rates, Diners volume was up more than 10% year over year, driven by strong results in several regions, especially Asia Pacific.","Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our results this quarter. I look forward to sharing more of our thoughts about the year ahead at our financial community briefing on May 5.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark, and he\u2019ll walk you through the details of our first quarter results.","Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Net interest income increased $66 million or 4% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth. ","Total noninterest income increased $27 million to $542 million, as higher net discount interchange revenue and direct mortgage related income more than offset the continued decline in protection product revenue. ","Net discount interchange revenue was up 6%, driven by increased sales and a lower rewards rate year over year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 102 basis points. On a reported basis, the rate was down 1 basis point year over year, but I would remind you that last year we recognized a forfeiture adjustment in the first quarter, so on an adjusted basis, the rate is actually up about 6 basis points.","Sequentially, the rewards rate was down significantly as the rate last quarter included a onetime charge for the elimination of our rewards forfeiture reserve, as we changed our programs so that cardholder rewards never expire.","Direct to mortgage related income increased this quarter as the refi market picked up due to the decline in mortgage rates several months back. As we\u2019ve said in the past, Discover Home Loans has been contributing or costing $0.01 or $0.02 of EPS most quarters, and this quarter, we were on the positive side of that range.","Protection products revenue declined $12 million as new product sales remain suspended.","Moving to payment services, revenue decreased 6% or $5 million from the prior year, mainly due to the previously announced loss of the Sam\u2019s and Walmart cobrand volume network partners. Volume for the segment, on the other hand, was relatively flat as growth in lower-margin B2B transactions mostly offset the loss and lower debit volumes.","Overall, we grew total company net revenues by 4% for the quarter. ","Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.37% was 7 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by a 9 basis point decrease in card yield. The year over year decrease in card yield reflects a small shift in portfolio mix as high rate balances are replaced by standard or promotional rate balances.","Personal loan yield decreased from the prior year, primarily driven by more customers opting for shorter term consolidation loans. Funding costs increased 10 basis points due to higher fixed rate debt issuances in the last 12 months.","Year to date, we\u2019ve completed two debt issuances, a $500 million 10-year fixed rate senior note and a $950 million 3-year floating rate ABS deal. We continue to position the balance sheet in anticipation of gradually rising rates.","Higher funding costs and lower total loan yield resulted in an 18 basis point decrease in net interest margin from the prior year to 9.69%.","Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were up $89 million over the prior year. Employee compensation increased $24 million due to higher headcount to support growth, annual salary increases, and higher commissions associated with the increase in home mortgage originations.","Marketing expenses increased $13 million as we invested in advertising for several products. Professional fees increased $28 million due in part to approximately $15 million in costs associated with anti-money laundering and related compliance program enhancements. Other expense was up due to a $20 million legal reserve addition. ","For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was 40%. Excluding the two unusual items I just mentioned, the total company efficiency ratio is roughly 38.5%, in line with our long term target.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit, on slide eight, provision for loan losses was higher by $118 million compared to the prior year, due to higher reserves and chargeoffs driven primarily by loan growth.","This quarter, we increased reserves by $30 million, while last year we had a $57 million reserve release. The credit card net chargeoff rate increased by 14 basis points from the prior quarter and by 8 basis points year over year, to 2.4%.","The 30-plus day delinquency rate of 1.64% declined relative to both the prior quarter and the prior year. A portion of the drop was driven by the implementation of some payment processing changes during the quarter. On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign.","The private student loan net chargeoff rate, excluding purchased loans, decreased 28 basis points in the prior year, partially due to more efficient collections strategies, as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year.","Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, decreased 13 basis points to 1.66%. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.","Switching to personal loans, the net chargeoff rate was up 15 basis points from the prior year and the over 30 day delinquency rate was up 8 basis points to 76 basis points. The year over year increase in the personal loan chargeoff rate was primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth.","One last item I\u2019ll call out on the income statement is that we were able to recognize some prior year state tax benefits, which reduced our effective tax rate to 35.5% for the quarter.","Next, I\u2019ll touch on our capital position, on slide nine. Our common equity tier one capital ratio increased sequentially by 60 basis points to 14.7%, due to the seasonal decline in loan balances from the fourth quarter. ","As previously announced on March 11, Discover received a nonobjection from the Federal Reserve on proposed capital actions during the five quarters ending June 30, 2016. We were pleased with the outcome and how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our capital ratios in the stress scenarios.","Based on the proposed capital actions, we plan to repurchase $2.2 billion of our common stock over the next five quarters, and last week, our board increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.24 to $0.28 per share.","In summary, it feels like a good start to the year, with strong loan growth and a continued benign credit environment. That concludes our formal remarks, so now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bill Franklin.","Bill Franklin","Hello, everyone. Only a few people are in the queue right now, so I\u2019m going to ask everyone to please dial *1. You may have already done this, but please dial *1 again, if you would like to ask a question. Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from Rick Shane from JPMorgan. ","Rick Shane","Mark, you talked a little bit about on the personal loans you\u2019re seeing a pickup in losses in terms of seasoning. I\u2019m really curious if you were to disaggregate the credit card portfolio, are you seeing the seasoned portfolio, any deterioration there? Or is it really just normalization of the newer loans that\u2019s driving\u2026 And again, it\u2019s a slight uptick, but the movement in chargeoffs?","Mark Graf ","Rick, I would say, kind of as we\u2019ve been telegraphing, the credit environment really does remain generally very benign. So the seasoned portfolio has really stabilized at this point in time. I would say the movements we\u2019re seeing are directly related to the loan growth we put on over the course of the last three to four years and the seasoning of that growth as it moves through the vintage curves.","Rick Shane ","So it\u2019s basically convergence, it\u2019s not an uptick on the larger portfolio?","Mark Graf ","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Friedman. ","James Friedman","First, David, with regard to the new Discover it card that you\u2019re introducing into the market with Miles, maybe more generally if you could talk about the competitive environment and how you\u2019re positioning that product.","David Nelms ","Of course, Discover it remains our flagship product, and we continue to enhance Discover it with the introduction of the Freeze on\/off switch, which we just introduced on that this quarter. We continue to enhance in areas like free FICO over time, and that\u2019s in part to basically stay ahead of competitors in value to consumers and things that can be differentially marketed.","The Discover it Miles card is on the same Discover it platform, but adds a new currency in terms of miles primarily positioned to people who travel or really value free travel. And I would think about it as more of an extension. We do think it will appeal to certain segments, and may directly go up against other competitors when they have miles type cards, whether cobrand or otherwise. And so we think it positions us well to compete in the marketplace. ","James Friedman ","And then just one quick follow up. I wanted to ask, have you seen the impact at all yet from the marketplace type vendors like Lending Club? I know it\u2019s more personal lines than they\u2019re fixed amortizing loans, but do you see them at all at this point, or is it too early?","David Nelms ","It\u2019s a little hard to track. There\u2019s no doubt that we must be running up against them some in the marketplace, because as you say, some of them have grown and have been very aggressive. They tend to play in a broader credit spectrum than we do, if you look at our 750 plus FICO score, and you compare it to those folks. There\u2019s a lot of people that they might book that we might not. But there would no doubt be some overlap, so we\u2019re watching what they\u2019re doing and if we can learn some things that can help us, we won\u2019t be shy about paying attention to them. ","Mark Graf ","I would just tack on to that, the yield compression we\u2019ve seen to date in the personal lending book is really attributable to the shortening of the duration the consumers are choosing. Going back a year or so ago, they picked a four year average amortization period. Today, they\u2019re picking a three year period. So as a fixed rate loan, it\u2019s just pricing further down the curve.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Mark, can you talk about when you think we might expect to see you guys reach the point where the seasoning on new account acquisition growth rate, that kind of stabilizes? And I guess with that, your provision begins to grow more in line with your loan growth, such that it\u2019s no longer a headwind to your EPS growth? I was just wondering if maybe you could give a sense for how far we are from that point, assuming of course that credit remains benign.","Mark Graf ","Bill, I would tell you it really depends on what happens to our growth rates. So a big piece of this puzzle is, if you think about, I\u2019ll visually draw you a vintage curve here, and kind of say, now, overlay four years of growth of those vintage curves. What\u2019s driving really the reserving is the area shaded under the peaks of all four of those curves overlaid on top of one another.","So theoretically, if you think about a vintage curve, as you do another year or two worth of growth, that really begins to stabilize if your growth rate is really stable. If you\u2019re growth rates accelerate, theoretically, it\u2019s going to take longer for that to happen. ","The good news is I think this is a really good problem to have, because we can\u2019t shrink our way to long term success. And ultimately, acquiring new card members and growing the book is the way we compound value over time. So while I understand obviously the impacts in the near term, I think over the long haul, it\u2019s, again, a pretty high class problem.","Bill Carcache ","So as far as you could tell, over the course of, call it, the next 12 months, those seasoning effects will lead to continued reserve building I guess at a level on particular with this quarter, or perhaps maybe even a little bit higher?","Mark Graf ","I guess what I would say is we don\u2019t provide forward guidance really on what we expect the reserves. We did at the beginning of the year give a sense for what we kind of expected on the full year in terms of provision rate, is really kind of where we touched on it. ","What I would do is I would take you back to our earlier comments and I\u2019d just say the credit environment remains really benign. So really, the provisioning you\u2019re seeing from us at this point in time is the result of that high class problem of growth, and not anything related to any deterioration in the portfolios. ","Bill Carcache ","And then I guess on a related point, and then I\u2019ll drop back out, I didn\u2019t hear any update on that 2.5 provision guidance. We assume that that continues to hold, that you guys gave last quarter. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the applicability of that? I know the investor day\u2019s coming up and there\u2019ll probably be more there, but anything you could say on it now would be great.","Mark Graf ","I would kick it to the investor day for a more fulsome update. I guess what I would say, just very quickly, is I don\u2019t see any reason to change that guidance at this point in time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Donat of Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Chris Donat","Mark, wanted to go back to the other income line that was $80 million this quarter. I think you said it was primarily from higher direct mortgage related income. Can you just remind us what kind of mortgages you\u2019re doing there? And I guess we have to make our own assumptions about how those fees are likely to operate given the rate environment we\u2019re in. But is it all kind of fixed rate product, like 30 year? Or is there other types of mortgages in there? ","Mark Graf ","There\u2019s a variety of product in there. I would say it\u2019s all conforming product, and it\u2019s all being packaged for sale. So we\u2019re not retaining any of that product on our own balance sheet. I would say if you look year over year, that other income item was up somewhere on the order of $29 million or $30 million, if I remember correctly.","Roughly, let\u2019s call it, two thirds of that is related to the mortgage business, so it was the largest driver of the increase that was embedded in there. And I think it\u2019s really a reflection that the fixed rate volumes picked up pretty dramatically as you saw the drop in the long treasury rates at the end of last year. And it takes a little while for that pipeline to kind of flow through the system, so I think that\u2019s really the impact to what you\u2019re seeing there.","Chris Donat","And this is refi or new originations?","Mark Graf ","I would say at this point in time, the vast majority of our business continues to be refi oriented.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","David, I had a question about interchange rates and I guess the discount rate for you guys. We\u2019re seeing a decent amount of competition in the cobrand space. I know you guys have experienced it firsthand. I was wondering if you had just any broad thoughts on kind of interchange rates and then whether or not you felt any pressure from other merchants recently given what we\u2019re hearing. ","David Nelms ","Well, I think that the big merchant discount interchange rate story that I guess I\u2019ve seen recently has been sort of the two warehouse clubs that I would just say feel like more unique situations. And there\u2019s not broad acceptance in either of those locations, and therefore the rates that we\u2019ve all seen printed seem very low compared to others. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily draw any conclusions about an impact on that more broadly. I think they\u2019re unique.","On the cobrand, I think that\u2019s a little different, and I\u2019m not sure it shows up in interchange, but what we see is that the cobrand market seems to have really heated up, and it has become very competitive in terms of terms, and it makes me glad that we\u2019re not in the cobrand business.","More broadly, I haven\u2019t noticed any trends one direction or another on merchant discount rate or interchange in the market.","Sanjay Sakhrani ","And then just a follow up question on M&A. I guess any updates there on opportunities that you guys might be seeing to use some of the excess capital you guys have? Obviously, there\u2019s a large pool of financial assets out there for sale. Not sure if you have any interest in that, but maybe just an update on that topic? And then Mark, just one data point question. The tax rate going forward, we should just assume it reverts back to like 38%? ","David Nelms ","On M&A, we may have a little more to comment on at investor day, but in a nutshell, I\u2019d say our primary focus is on organic growth. And I\u2019ll shoot it over to Mark for the other.","Mark Graf ","On the tax rate, I would say there might be a little bit of goodness in the tax rate this year, but not anything particularly meaningful.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham.","David Hochstim","Could you expand maybe on what impact you\u2019ve seen from lower gas prices, aside from the headwind on spending? Have you seen any changes yet in customer spending or behavior during the quarter, gas related or not gas related? ","David Nelms ","Well, we called out that the gas prices alone had a pretty significant impact, about 2% I guess, on our sales. And I think that there would be a small knock on effect on loan growth as well. There\u2019s a lot of transactor volume within gas, but obviously some of it would also evolve.","You know, what is maybe a little surprising to me so far is I might have expected some of that increase in discretionary spending that consumers have left to have been spent on other things. And I really didn\u2019t see that during the quarter. We saw retailers broadly not have great sales. ","There\u2019s some view that a lot of people are talking about the weather having an impact in the quarter, but I guess I am hopeful that the broader economy and the broader consumer spending would pick up, even apart from gas, in the future. But we just didn\u2019t see it during the quarter. ","I guess the other question is what are they doing with the money? It seems to be an increase in savings rate. I\u2019ve seen some comments about whether it\u2019s benefitting credit. It certainly shouldn\u2019t be a negative for credit, but I think it\u2019s a little early for me to conclude that lower gas prices are going to improve credit results. ","David Hochstim ","And did you see any change in consumer spending over the course of the quarter? Was February particularly weak because of weather, do you think?","David Nelms ","You know, March was a bit better than January and February, but still, March still wasn\u2019t where I\u2019d like to see it. And we\u2019ve seen Moody\u2019s and a number of people take down their forecast for the year. This was a broad industry kind of thing. We\u2019ve seen most of our competitors lower growth rate on sales and we certainly experienced that in our customer base as well. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Bob Napoli","On the growth in student loans and in the consumer portfolio, they both slowed down somewhat. The consumer was almost flat quarter over quarter from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. That\u2019s been growing year over year close to 20%, the same with the student loan ex PCI. Is that competition from the marketplace lenders and student lending and consumer, or do you still expect to be able to grow those portfolios along the same lines that you have been the last couple of years?","David Nelms ","I tend to look at year over year changes to help remove the seasonality in really all the business, but particularly in student loans. And our origination volume in both of those businesses in dollars has continued to grow nicely. And so I think what we\u2019re seeing is percentages, even if you increase originations and you increase dollars of loans off of a higher base, the percentages could modestly [decrease]. But if anything, we\u2019re picking up the dollar growth.","Mark Graf ","The other thing I would note is just that obviously the student loan business is lumpy in terms of disbursement cycles. So you have to take that into account in terms of the periods you\u2019re comparing as well. ","Bob Napoli ","And just on the B2B business, the Ariba business, it looks like you\u2019re getting some pretty large volume, but what should we expect from a volume perspective? And is line of sight to that being material to your business, is that 12 months, 24 months? How is that business progressing and when can it move the needle?","David Nelms","You know, it\u2019s going to be sometime before it really contributes in any meaningful way to profits. But without forecasting exact numbers, we do expect the volume to continue to grow. And it seems to be very well received. It\u2019s unique, and it seems to be very well received by some businesses and by the partners of SAP and Ariba.","Operator","And our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. ","Don Fandetti","Mark, I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts on the card yield and also the efficiency ratio over the next couple quarters. And then David, do you think there will be any impact or change to the rewards competitive environment when short term rates rise?","Mark Graf ","I\u2019ll tackle the first couple. And I remember the first one is card yield, and then I\u2019m forgetting. I\u2019m sorry, what was the second?","Don Fandetti ","Card yield and [unintelligible].","Mark Graf ","Efficiency ratio. You got it. So, from a card yield perspective, I would say the real compression thus far has been driven really by more what I call portfolio mix across the card business. So what we\u2019re continuing to see is pre-CARD Act higher rate balances continue to run off. And given the very positive credit environment right now, that bucket\u2019s not getting refilled quickly. ","And where we are seeing greater growth, obviously, is in what I would call the standard price receivables, as well as promotional receivables also. So I would expect that phenomenon would continue to play out over the coming quarters and you would see some relative stability to modest compression in card yield. ","In terms of the adjusted efficiency ratio, what I\u2019m doing basically on that one is I\u2019m just taking the reported efficiency ratio of around 40%, I\u2019m backing out the $20 million legal reserve addition, and I\u2019m backing out the $15 million related to AML BSA remediation efforts, really kind of calling them out as noncore kind of things. And on a core basis, your efficiency ratio comes out at 38.5%. ","Don Fandetti ","And that\u2019s kind of still where you\u2019re thinking?","Mark Graf ","Yeah, I think what we\u2019ve said for the year is that we expect we\u2019ll be slightly above that 38% target range. And I don\u2019t see any reason to dissuade you from continuing to focus on that guidance. ","David Nelms ","And on rewards, I think to a large degree, we\u2019re at a new normal. I mean, consumers love rewards. That\u2019s what\u2019s working. And therefore, competitors have migrated to rewards generally. Cash rewards, I think particularly is working well, and therefore you\u2019re seeing competition in that space.","I think that if some issuers start getting pressured on profits, and whether that\u2019s from rates or chargeoffs or other factors, higher marketing costs is an example, the ones who may have gone to an unsustainably high level of rewards probably will make an adjustment. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But I\u2019m not sure that the average rewards rate for the industry and for us is unsustainable in the long run in terms of producing a good profit margin and providing great value for consumer.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. ","Ryan Nash","Just a couple of questions on expenses. First, the $20 million addition to the legal reserve, was that contemplated in your $3.5 billion guidance? And on the $15 million of BSA AML, how do you expect the remaining 60 to ramp? Would you expect it to be front loaded or would you expect it to be a little bit more evenly spread throughout the remaining quarters of the year?","Mark Graf ","I would say no, the $20 million was not contemplated in the guidance we gave, number one. Number two, I would expect you will see the expense ramp a little bit associated with the AML BSA remediation activities.","Ryan Nash ","And then just as a follow up to that, has anything changed from what you told us last quarter on the expense front? Do you continue to believe the $110 million of incremental expenses for BSA E&B will be one-time in nature? ","Mark Graf ","I believe the specific expenses we called out will be one-time in nature. I think as we think about our business planning, there will be some run rate expenses that we think we can cover with other operational efficiencies and everything else related to some of those matters. So just to be clear, it\u2019s really the nonrecurring things where we\u2019re not changing our guidance on those things at this point. ","Ryan Nash ","And if I could squeeze one more in, on the net interest margin you outlined, the issuance that you\u2019ve done thus far, should we assume NIM pressure to continue in this mid-single digits level until rates rise? I know you\u2019ve talked in the past about wanting to make the balance sheet rate neutral through the cycle, which I believe you guys are at or at least close to. How should we think about how much more insurance you guys want to buy to protect against higher interest rates?","Mark Graf ","Great question. I guess what I would say is yeah, we guided to that modest compression quarter over quarter this time around, and kind of what we saw was really in line with our expectations. Looking at second quarter, I think you can probably expect a similar or somewhat similar decline there for the second quarter, about half driven by yields and about half by funding costs, plus or minus.","Beyond next quarter, I would say the pace of the decline really begins to level off quite a bit. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to pierce a 950 margin or something this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Harbes from Wells Fargo. ","Jason Harbes","Question on EMV. The merchant liability shift is still months away, but we\u2019re already hearing requests for a delay. Can you maybe share your perspective on the EMV implementation along with some of the potential costs and benefits?","David Nelms ","That would be a big topic, so I\u2019m not going to try to fully address it. Again, at investor day, we\u2019ll try to tackle it a little more broadly. I think that it\u2019s important that we all try to hit the October date. This has been a long time in the works. It\u2019s been a date that was set quite some time ago. ","And as an industry, we know we need to do something to better control security and fraud losses. And frankly, we could issue all the cards we want with chips, but if there\u2019s not terminals to use them, it actually would cost us money. There would be zero fraud savings. And I think it\u2019s in the merchants\u2019 best interest to try to get there, if anything more than it is for the issuers, when you look at some of the breaches that have happened. ","I think more broadly, I expect that this is going to be a somewhat rocky rollout for the industry. This is a huge change for consumers, for people at point of sale. Consumers are going to have to start dipping their card instead of swiping it. Some merchants are going to be different. ","So I think that merchants, acquirers, issuers, we\u2019re all going to be having to help educate consumers on the new way it works. And that\u2019s what we saw in other places in the world where EMV rolled out, is that it took a while to smooth out the edges and fundamentally change something that\u2019s been in place for a few decades. ","Jason Harbes ","And maybe as my follow up, can you remind us what are your capital deployment priorities, and what would be a reasonable timetable for hitting your 11% target? ","Mark Graf ","I would say the capital deployment priorities remain first and foremost continued investments in organic growth in the business. I would say second of all, to the extent it\u2019s permissible under the current CCAR restrictions, returning it to shareholders. The reason those are number one and number two is because we think they have very definable returns associated with them and make a lot of sense. ","The third priority, I would say, would be what I would call acquisitions of financial assets as opposed to operating businesses. But those would really have to be financially motivated buys, because obviously, if you buy in a trading book, you don\u2019t get growth. It makes growth more challenging. So I would say they\u2019d have to be financially motivated buys. ","And then last but not least, I would say with respect to traditional acquisitions, I would say that\u2019s fourth of four. There\u2019s a pretty high bar there, right? I think you\u2019ve got integration risk, execution risk, diligence risk, key person retention risk. So the bar on traditional M&A is pretty high. And you know, while the BSA AML thing is out there, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s primarily our focal area either. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Maybe just a little bit of a follow up on the it Miles product. I\u2019ve seen some of the solicitations coming out, and I\u2019ve seen from the mail data that your numbers are starting to pick up. Can you give us a sense of the timing of that rollout and maybe what impact it might have on spending and receivables?","David Nelms ","We\u2019re still in a ramp up phase, but A) it will be significantly smaller than the flagship Discover it card, even when it\u2019s sort of fully deployed. And B) you should expect some substitution. It\u2019s not pure incremental marketing solicitations or dollars. We\u2019ll be marketing Discover it Miles where we think we can get better response rates, better returns, better activation and usage versus the flagship. And we may be doing some alternating of products as well.","So I think bottom line, I wouldn\u2019t think about Discover it Miles as being something that will necessarily accelerate growth, but hopefully, to help us to maintain growth. We\u2019ve obviously been growing much faster than the industry in the past several years, and we have to innovate if we\u2019re going to keep that up. ","Operator","And our next question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies.","John Hecht","You said commentary in the context of deposit and liability management. You have a little bit of a step up in excess liquidity. We\u2019ve learned, I guess, a little bit more maybe, about the rate cycle. What should we think about you guys over the next few months in terms of managing your liabilities and thoughts on deposit [fundraising]?","Mark Graf ","I would say a couple of different things there. Number one, the balance sheet today has been positioned to be what I would call modestly asset sensitive. Sort of what\u2019s caused the margin compression, or a big cause of the margin compression, we\u2019ve consciously taken, over the course of the last couple of quarters, to build that positioning, right? ","So I think if you think about not just a one year forward NII, but if you think about the 10 forward years and the NII impact in each of those 10 years, we\u2019re managing to be net positive through the cycle, if you will, with respect to our asset liability positioning.","So we will continue to make those investments. So if you think about the liability side of the balance sheet and how it contributes to that, I would say a couple of things. Number one, I would say we as a team will always favor deposits over capital markets liabilities. They come with customers attached to them. We can cross sell to customers. There\u2019s a fulsome relationship that can be built there. So we will always lean on using our balance sheet to service our customers and funding it with our customers\u2019 deposits. ","So that being said, I think the model is such that we\u2019re not going to necessarily be the highest rate payer in town. That\u2019s not our goal. But we\u2019re going to be a very fair rate payer relative to traditional banks.","I would say with respect to the capital markets, things we\u2019ve done there, I think we\u2019ve gotten the balance sheet into the position we want to see it, so I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of fixed rate funding from this point. Not saying none, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot. What we would do from this point forward would be to protect the positioning we\u2019ve built as the balance sheet grows and shifts in composition as opposed to trying to structure a more asset sensitive position. ","John Hecht ","And the related question is, I\u2019m wondering if you could give us an update on the rollout of the cash back checking, or is that something you just keep in your pockets as rates go up?","David Nelms ","We are making efforts to increase the cross sell and we\u2019re continuing to enhance the feature functionality of the product. And we\u2019re hopeful that by year-end we\u2019ll be ready for broad market launch, but frankly, for now, we\u2019re continuing to focus on the cross sell.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America.","Ken Bruce","My question really is a follow up to James Friedman\u2019s question about the marketplace lenders. I understand that it may be a little early and you\u2019re kind of watching and learning, but I guess there\u2019s been a lot of capital raise recently and a lot more focus on that particular model, so one would suspect that there\u2019s going to be more activity than less going forward, and they\u2019ve specifically targeted revolving credit and essentially debt consolidation within the sector as a primary area of growth. ","So how do you think about that competitively? Do you think that it\u2019s a real risk? And I guess in your early stages, what would be your response to compete against those?","David Nelms ","You know, I think that at the margin, our personal loans product does the same thing. We do consolidate loans, including credit card loans. So to some degree, it\u2019s not a new product. It had gotten a lot smaller as a category after the crisis, and to some degree, I think it\u2019s sort of returning to where it was before, but with maybe new players and new approaches.","At the margin, it\u2019s got to have a little impact on the total card business receivables, but we haven\u2019t figured out a way to measure it at this point. We will be watching it. You know, there\u2019s origination fees. A personal loan is very different than a credit card that tends to be a small, temporary loan coming from spending usually. Credit card has a lot more features than a personal loan does. ","But a consolidation loan also has its place, and I guess for a couple of years now, we\u2019ve been, by far, the leader in this space, and now we\u2019ve got some company with a different funding model. ","Ken Bruce ","And maybe also another follow up. Mark, you had mentioned that basically you are, from just a pure funding perspective, kind of positioned where you want to be. Are you at target duration on the liability side of the balance sheet now, and that it would just kind of match the general growth of the business? Or do you envision any changes, just given we keep pushing out the future rate hikes, and it feels like, as David\u2019s comments would suggest, things have softened up around the edges, so maybe we\u2019re looking at a lower rate environment maybe than you expected even three months ago?","Mark Graf ","I guess I can make you happy by saying we\u2019re never expecting a rapid ramp in rates. I mean, the activities we\u2019ve undertaken have always expected a pretty gradual movement. Now, from a risk management perspective, we run lots of shock scenarios to make sure we\u2019re protected. But what we\u2019ve been positioning ourselves for really is that principal case of a gradual rise in rates. So our thoughts around what\u2019s going to happen really hasn\u2019t shifted all that much in terms of timing or magnitudes. ","What I would say is the answer to your question about duration targeting, yeah, we\u2019re within a month or two of where ultimately, in a perfect world, I\u2019d like to see us be. So it feels like, again back to my earlier comment, we will do some fixed rate funding from here. ","It will be characterized in one of two different ways, either pure optimism, because we see, for lack of a better word, an arbitrage opportunity that makes a lot of sense, or number two, I would say it would be in response to shifts in the composition and growth in the balance sheet. So if we put more fixed rate assets on, you would expect to see us cover that with more fixed rate funding. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Valentin from FBR & Co. ","Scott Valentin","With regard to the personal loans, just curious kind of over the cycle, where you would see losses for that product versus the credit cards.","David Nelms ","You know, what I would rather do is defer to investor day on that. We have given that kind of guidance in previous investor days, and Bill\u2019s happy to give you those laying that out. But generally, personal loans, the way we underwrite them, probably have somewhat better loss characteristics than credit cards. It\u2019s very high FICO scores.","Scott Valentin ","In terms of the rewards programs, is there a cost benefit to the Miles program versus the cash back, on the rewards side?","David Nelms ","Yes, the Miles card is a bit more expensive from a rewards perspective. And we expect to see that offset by higher spending, higher balances, and engagement. So the way we look at it is we expect sort of similar overall returns, even though we also expect a higher rewards cost. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Cheryl Pate of Morgan Stanley.","Cheryl Pate","Just a couple of follow up questions on the net interest margin, if I may. I guess first, on the credit card yield, I think you spoke to a bit of a mix shift more towards standard and promotional type balances. Just wondering if, on the promotional balances specifically, you can speak to the growth there, and has that been growing faster than other parts of the portfolio maybe, as we see some competition in the space?","David Nelms ","We\u2019ll give some more color on that at our investor day, but what I would say is the strongest growing portion of the book, by far, is the standard rate portion of the book. And I don\u2019t think by any stretch of the imagination we\u2019re being undisciplined with these promo balances or anything along those lines. The growth is really being driven by regular way usage of the card, which feels really solid.","Cheryl Pate ","And just a second follow up, if I might, on the personal loan side. You spoke to sort of consumer preference to shorter term loans from here. Has that been any change in pricing strategy or should we think of that as sort of getting ahead of rates? Is there any behavior in particular that\u2019s incenting that, or maybe the competitive environment, that might be fueling that? ","David Nelms ","We\u2019ve looked at it from any number of different angles. We can\u2019t really discern any one particular thing, other than to say there\u2019s clearly been a shift in consumer preference, possibly as we\u2019ve gotten further away from the crisis, folks are feeling more confident in their financial situation, more confident in their employment situation, everything else. They\u2019re comfortable carrying a heavier payment and paying it down quicker.","But we can\u2019t isolate and say definitively it\u2019s, gee, due to that, or due to something else. But that\u2019s kind of the operative thesis, for lack of a better way of putting it. ","Operator","And our next question comes from David Ho from Deutsche Bank. ","David Ho","Real quickly, back on the warehouse clubs, opening up acceptance to Visa cards, [unintelligible] volume out of the store, obviously those cards are more competitive versus yours, versus their previous provider. I know it\u2019s early days, and next year, but any potential impact in terms of wallet share as you think about some of the cash back offerings associated with the opening up of acceptance for those cards?","David Nelms ","No. Discover already has the highest acceptance in the top 100 retailers, and what I would expect, especially the way this is happening, is everyone already has multiple Visa cards. And so to some degree, they\u2019ll be able to put their spend on the same Visa card they already have, versus having to put it on a different card. So I don\u2019t see an impact on us. ","David Ho ","And separately, what factors may you be considering in terms of what you plan to do with the direct mortgage business? And when do those expenses maybe come out a little bit more out of the cost structure? And then how are you thinking about the home equity installment loan side of the business as well?","David Nelms ","On the mortgage business, while we\u2019re pleased, as Mark indicated, that given the attractive environment this quarter, it was helpful. But we still are confident that the rate environment is going to move up, and therefore, refinance volume is going to decline. So we are continuing to look closely at options to make sure that it not become a drag over time.","On the home equity business, it\u2019s just early days. We launched both personal loans and student loans in 1987, and we kept them pretty small until we felt really good about them, and then we started scaling them. I think we think the same way with home equity. We feel good about the business, but we\u2019re not to the point where we would feel like we\u2019re ready to ramp up to any significant degree.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Howlett with UBS. ","Matthew Howlett","Just on the card payment rates, I know they\u2019ve remained elevated from years past. And we looked at the master trust, I know that doesn\u2019t represent everything, but it appears to be picking up a bit year over year. Anything to say on that in terms of the guidance for loan growth? Do you expect sort of payment rates to remain in this range? Or how do you see consumer behavior changing?","David Nelms ","I expect it to be reasonably stable. It obviously can jump around a little bit from time to time, but I think the big story is credit is really good, and so that tends to correlate with relatively high payment rates. ","Matthew Howlett ","So you expect them to be flattish? I know yours are sort of in the middle. You\u2019re not the highest, you\u2019re not the lowest. But sort of in this current range, do we see lower payment rates when credit eventually normalizes? Is that sort of what happens?","David Nelms ","Generally, it will move a little bit because of that. And if you think about us relative to others, we tend to focus a bit more on revolvers versus transactors, which tend to have lower payment rates on revolvers. So by definition, a transactor is 100% payment rate. And on the flipside, we tend to have better credit, which tends to drive higher payment rates. And so those two are kind of competing forces to get us to where we are. But I\u2019m not expecting a big trend in that number.","Matthew Howlett ","I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions on the card margin, but you mentioned the mix shift with some of the balance transfers coming in. Is that just a normalization? Is any of that being driven by competition? I know one of the big money center banks guided to the low end of their revenue margin for the year. Any pricing dynamics changing there, where more balance transfers could be introduced?","Mark Graf ","No, I would say the bigger dynamic is actually the replacement of the high rate bucket with standard rate product is actually a bigger driver at this point in time than the promotional activity itself. So we\u2019re tending to use the promotional activities more with the legacy portfolio as opposed to the new account side of the equation. And standard merchandise sales are really the big driver of that yield compression, sort of across both the new accounts and the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark DeVries of Barclays. ","Mark DeVries","First question is around noninterest income. Just wondering, one, if you could give us an update on where your direct mortgage pipeline is shaping up for the quarter. And also, whether you can provide us an update on where you stand on relaunching your protection products.","Mark Graf ","On the second question, we have no current plans to relaunch protection products. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate. ","David Nelms ","And on the mortgage pipeline, what I\u2019d tell you is we haven\u2019t traditionally disclosed our pipeline. I guess what I\u2019d say is what we have said is it tends to flip between accreting a penny and losing a penny a share a quarter, and I would just say it\u2019s going to be in that range again this next quarter, just based on everything I see right now. ","Mark DeVries ","And then another question on your student lending credit. I think Mark, you indicated that it\u2019s seasoning as you expected, but both chargeoffs and delinquencies were down pretty substantially year over year. Is there anything to call out there? Are you seeing credit improve on that book?","Mark Graf ","I\u2019d say we were generally pleased with the numbers this quarter. That business, partly because of its size and maturity and seasonality, does tend to fluctuate a lot more quarter to quarter than our other businesses. One of the things that we have done is put in place some programs to help students who might be struggling. And we feel like we might be getting a little traction on some of those programs. That\u2019s good for both consumers and us. But I think we need a few more data points to see how material our immaterial those can be.","David Nelms ","The other thing I would just say is I think the employment market for graduates has continued to improve a bit. So I\u2019m certainly hopeful that that will portend good things for credit over the long term.","Operator","And thank you. Our last question will come from Jason Arnold with RBC. ","Jason Arnold","Just another quick follow up on the airline rewards card side. I was just wondering if there\u2019s any way you can size the broader industry opportunity set in airline rewards, focused customers versus those that are more cash back or points reward focused. And then if you could comment on the incremental opportunity for growth that you mentioned for Discover, if that\u2019s more of a product of that balance of focus there, or if it\u2019s just your focus on cash back reward and its being incremental?","David Nelms ","By far, the largest airline rewards cards, as you know, are cobranded rewards cards for people that frequent a certain airline and are really heavy travelers. And that\u2019s a very sizable market. It\u2019s also one that there\u2019s some very significant cobrand payments associated with it. And I would say that\u2019s generally not what we\u2019re targeting with this product.","I\u2019d say this product is targeting people that like the idea of earning travel rewards. They may travel some, but they\u2019re not the global travelers who are being reimbursed by their company or just traveling very extensively on business.","So I would think about it as somewhat smaller market than either the traditional airline cobrand card or the traditional cash back category, which we are a leader in, and that will continue to be where our flagship card is. So I feel like this a bit more of an important niche and an important second product for us.","Operator","We have no further questions. At this time, I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin for final remarks. ","Bill Franklin","We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Discover Financial Services Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session, [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations you may begin your conference.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Chantal. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us.","Let me begin as always with Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K Report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our Web site and on file with the SEC.","In the annual and fourth quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated.","So, now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. Who will begin his comments on Page 3 of the presentation.","David Nelms","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to review the full year 2016 accomplishments and 2017 key focus areas and then turn it over to Mark to cover fourth quarter results. 2016 was another strong year, as we delivered 21% return on equity and we accelerated loan growth. This loan growth acceleration as well as net interest margin expansion drove strong revenue growth. ","Operating expenses benefited from the completion of the AML look back project, earlier this year and the exit of the home loan business last year. Higher provisions from the seasoning of the last several years of loan growth, partially offset some of this positive operating leverage, but were in line with our expectations for credit costs. All-in our full year earnings per share rose 12% bolstered by almost $2 billion of share repurchases.","We accomplished a great deal in 2016 against our key focused areas, including as you can see on Slide 4, accelerating the pace of loan growth to nearly 7%. Above the 4% to 6% expectation we set a year ago. In total, we increased loans by nearly $5 billion, our largest organic increase in loan balances in 15 years. Our card business was the largest driver of that growth. Reflecting on some cards specific accomplishments, we launched credit score card, which provide both current and prospective customers free easy access to their FICO score. And we introduced the Discover it Secured Credit Card, targeted customers who are looking to establish or rebuild their credit history.","Our credit cards continue to resonate well with prime revolvers, as we have [ph] a post-recession high number of new accounts for the year, which was the biggest driver of the loan growth. We achieved this growth while maintaining our disciplined approach to underwriting and as the result the credit quality remains strong. Our total company net charge-off rate excluding acquired loans was 2.24% in 2016, 12 basis points above 2015, still very low relative to historical experience and among the lowest in the industry.","Moving to our other direct banking products on Page 5, personal loans set a record with originations of $4 billion, an increase of 31% over the prior year. Growth in originations was largely fueled by product enhancements and strong execution.","Product enhancements in 2016 included a higher maximum loan amount and improved mobile responsive Web site and application and security [ph] functionality. Which allows customers to review [ph] their interest rate and estimate monthly payments without impacting their credit score. Student loans also set a record with 1.4 billion in originations, an increase of 9%. We expanded our student loan awareness efforts via marketing and our field sales force, as well as redesign of the application experience, resulting and a higher conversion rate and more satisfied customers.","In payments, the discover network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business and network partners. I am pleased that all PULSE Network Volume is stabilizing as shown on Page 6, after trending down for the last couple of years, due primarily to the competitive response related to the implementation of the Durbin Amendment in 2012. I believe PULSE is now poised for modest growth in 2017.","Internationally, we established a new partner shift with Elo, the largest resilient card network to allow Elo card holders to use their cards across our global network. Diners Club returned to growth are in FX adjusted or real basis a couple of years ago, but I\u2019m happy to see volumes grew as well on a nominal basis in 2016. As several of the new partners we\u2019ve signed over the last few years are now growing nicely.","Moving to Page 7, we\u2019ve returned more than 2.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases last year, which represents 99% of our net income. As a result, we reduce out saving shares of common stock by 8%. This combined with net income growth of 4% drove our EPS to be 12% higher. You can also see in the chart on the right how our return on equity has remained above 20% for the last four years, much higher than other large banks. As we look back on 2016, we feel good about all we\u2019ve been able to accomplish.","Now I\u2019ll spend a couple of minutes discussing our key focus areas for 2017 before I turn it over to Mark to walk through the fourth quarter results. First, we will be focused on sustaining profitable growth. In card we will continue to enhance our products by introducing innovative features and benefits and prudently adjusting reward offerings to drive greater customer engagement. Underlying all of our initiatives is our commitment to disciplined credit management and great customer service, which has historically served us well.","I think it\u2019s fair to say that a number of competitors are pursuing growth for the sake of growth, which is generating some transactor sales share shift, but resulting in lower revenues for them. By contrast, you saw our loans and revenue grow at similar rates in the fourth quarter. Our approach and execution have shown discipline and that is our continued commitment to shareholders. Building on our momentum in both lending and deposit products, we bore [ph] increased marketing to improve consumer awareness and consideration across products, as well as continue our efforts to increased product differentiation.","To do this, we will also invest in technology to enhance our products and processes. So that we can offer consumers what they want most and make it simple for existing customers to add additional products. In payments, we have a unique set of assets, which we believe presents many long-term opportunities. Near term we are focused on getting the most from our proprietary network for our card issuing business, including increased acceptance and brand differentiation. Third party volumes stabilized at the end of the year and we continue to seek opportunities to defend and grow our PIN debit business and penetrate the signature debit market. Additionally, we will continue to pursue new ways to partner, to better leverage our network and drive volume growth.","In 2017, we will remain focused on enhancing our AML\/BSA compliance functions. Continuing to invest in compliance and risk management strengthens our operations and supports our leadership position in customer service. In closing, I want to thank our employees for serving our customers so well and producing strong financial results in 2016. I\u2019m excited about the momentum we have going into 2017.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark to cover fourth quarter results and provide some guidance for the year.","Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin my remarks on Slide 8 of our presentation. For the fourth quarter we reported net income of $563 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.40. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter with EPS up 23% year-over-year and return on equity of 20%.","Turning to Slide 9, card and personal loans finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, accelerating total loan growth to almost 7% over the prior year. Card balances were driven by increased sales, which were up 3%, a higher revolve rate on merchandise sales and higher promotional balances.","Personal loans grew 18% over the prior year due to successful marketing initiatives and the product enhancements that David mentioned earlier. Student loans grew 2% as run-off in the acquired portfolios partially offset growth in the organic book. Looking solely at the organic student loan portfolio, it increased 13%, with strong performance during this year\u2019s peak season.","Moving to our payment service segment, PULSE volume and network partners were relatively flat year-over-year while Diners Club volume increased 8%, driven by continued strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.","Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased $160 million or 9% over the prior year driven by a combination of loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income decreased $7 million to $466 million. Net discount in interchange revenue was down 3% driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. The rewards rate was up six basis points from the prior quarter and about eight basis points from the prior year.","The increase over last year is driven by higher promotional rewards as well as a continuing [technical difficulty] Discover it, from our prior flagship cash back products. The increase in promotional rewards is primarily due to better customer engagement with the rotating 5% category which was broader than last year as it included department stores, Amazon and warehouse clubs.","The Cashback Match program, which helped drive strong new account growth this quarter, also contributed to the increase in promotional rewards. In payment services, revenue was flat year-over-year. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 7% for the quarter.","Turning to Slide 11. Total loan yield of 11.88% was 39 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 42 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in card yield was due to a greater percentage of card receivables being revolving in nature, higher rates in the portfolio, the impact of the December 2015 prime rate increase and a few basis points from last month's rate increased, the benefits of which will be more fully reflected in the first quarter.","On the funding side we grew average direct consumer deposits by $5 billion to make up 47% of our total funding. Our funding costs increased 10 basis points, driven by changes in funding mix as well as higher market rates. Overall net interest margin expanded 32 basis points from the prior call to 10.07%. ","Turning to Slide 12, operating expenses were down $36 million over the prior year. But I would remind you that last year's results had $37 million in expense related to the AML look back project. Marketing expenses were down $20 million, due to lower deposit marketing, as well as a shift in the timing of credit card campaigns related to last year. Professional fees fell $18 million, primarily due to the completion of look back related anti-money laundering remediation activities earlier this year. Partially offsetting these expense reductions is a 90 million year-over-year increase in employee compensation, resulting from higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as the impact of higher average salaries.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 13, provision for loan losses was higher by $94 million compared to the prior year, due to higher charge-offs and a larger reserve build, both primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth. This quarter we increased reserves to $143 million, while last year we had a slightly smaller build of a $126 million. I would reiterate that loan growth is the driver here, on balance the credit back drop continues to remain benign with a modest level of normalization continuing.","Looking at card, the net charge-off rate of 2.47% increased by 29 basis points year-over-year, and 30 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 2.04% increased 32 basis points year-over-year and was up 17 basis points sequentially.","Turning to private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 12 basis points from the prior year due to seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate increased 40 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again, excluding our acquired loans, are up 31 basis points compared to the prior year and 35 basis points sequentially. The increase in delinquencies is primarily driven by a greater portion of the student loan portfolio entering repayment and the seasoning of loan growth.","Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 42 basis points from the prior year and 7 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 23 basis points from the prior year and 14 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were driven by the seasoning of loan growth, and a higher mix of customers who drive strong risk adjusted returns that has slightly higher losses. Across all three major asset classes card, student and personal loans credit performance continues to be generally in line with our expectations.","Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 14. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased in for Basel III declined 60 basis point sequentially. The ratio decreased from the prior year due to the capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter we repurchased 2% of our common stock.","Moving to 2017 guidance on Slide 15, first we've increased our loan growth target range for the next year to 5.5% to 7.5% above our long term target range of 4% to 6%, based on opportunities that we see to continue to drive disciplined profitable loan growth. In order to support that higher growth target we expect operating expenses to rise to approximately $3.8 billion next year.","We've been saying for several quarters now that we would invest some of our NIM upside back into the business to the extent we could find profitable opportunities to do so, and we believe we have opportunities to do just that in 2017. Another driver of the loan growth is higher sales, there we expect to continue with focused innovations around our rewards program to drive engagement and growth in our target segments. As a result, we expect the rewards rate to come in between 126 and 128 basis points for full year 2017.","Moving to our outlook for net interest margin, we expect it to increase slightly versus full year 2016's net interest margin. The prime rate increase from last month is not fully reflected in fourth quarter results due to timing. And that alone will result in NIM expansion in 2017. Further rate increases would also result in NIM expansion due to the asset sensitive position that we built into the balance sheet. And we are currently expecting a couple of more rate increases this year based on the market implied forecast.","Somewhat offsetting the benefit provided by the rate environment will be the level of card promotional activity and modestly higher charge offs of accrued interest. Finally, we expect the total net charge off rate this year to be modestly higher than the 2.16% net charge off rate we delivered in 2016 due largely to the seasoning of a growing portfolio. Let me reiterate the overall consumer credit environment continues to feel benign.","So to summarize we'll remain disciplined in our approach to loan growth, focusing on our core prime customers, while also identifying and targeting new customer populations when we believe there are opportunities for incremental growth with good risk adjusted returns. It is the pursuit of these opportunities that is driving the higher operating expenses I discussed on the prior slide. Payments volume is stabilizing and we expect it to return to single digit growth. We have a strong capital position that enables us to both continue to invest in the business to drive growth as well as deliver a strong payout ratio in total yield. And finally our business model continues to generate very strong returns on equity.","Before I pass the call back to the operator there's one more piece of information I'd like to share with you. For the past four years Bill Franklin has done a great job at the helm of our Investor Relations function, but now it's time for him to take on new responsibilities. Effective February 1st, Bill will be assuming the role as our Assistant Treasurer, responsible for funding and rating agency relationships. Stepping into Bill's shoes will be Tim Schmidt who's done a great job serving in that Assistant Treasurer role that Bill will be assuming. Tim is well known among debt investors and I'm looking forward to introducing him to the equity community as the conference and road show season kicks off.","That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to the operator, Chantal, to open the line for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Ryan Nash","I was wondering if you could give us a little more clarity on the expense guidance, Mark you made some reference to a potential for higher marketing. In your remarks, I know David had made some comments about investing in some technology. Could you just kind of contextualize how much of the spending you\u2019re doing is to drive new growth versus core infrastructure build? And how should we think about the ongoing core growth rate. Is this an elevated year, just because of the fact where you said you\u2019re going to be reinvesting in the NIM and we should see expense growth essentially comeback down?","David Nelms","Ryan, I would say that absolutely the driver of the expense growth this year is the investments in continuing to drive stronger growth rates across the portfolio. If you think about it on a core basis, we really pull out the look back on a prior year and compare it norm-to-norm. I would say core expense growth is somewhere in the order of 2.5% plus or minus.","So it feels very well control from my perspective. The remainder of that expense growth is discretionary investment that is directly related to driving stronger production where we found opportunities to do just that. A big chunk of it is very aggressive marketing, we can always adjust that, if our returns don\u2019t come in as we expected them to on those investment dollars or if the environment were to turn on us. But we see great opportunities right now, building off of the strength in the fourth quarter and we feel really good about making that investment.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then just on your comment regarding the 5.5% to 7.5% leverage. You talked about new opportunities for customers with good risk adjustment. Could you maybe expand on that front, are you guys dipping down below the historical levels of which -- of where you played in the card business and how should we think about the longer term impact on charge offs related to that?","David Nelms","No, I would say Ryan, I think about these things as really incremental where we\u2019re seeing great opportunities. So for example, if you think about a secured card for example. That's somewhere where you're going to have a lot of these customers no FICO or very low FICO, but because you\u2019re holding collateral, the risk adjustments return on that doesn\u2019t look radically different than our traditional portfolio. So that\u2019s just one example.","We always look for opportunities where we can expand the box a little bit, but I would say this really reflects more a deepening of the existing strategy that it does expanding the box and really going significantly down market in any way.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And congrats to Bill on the new role.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you, congrats Bill. I guess my question is around the NIM outlook assumptions. Mark could you just talk about how much of this last rate benefit you\u2019re actually incorporating into this guidance of slightly higher and then the subsequent rating [ph] prices that may occur in the future?","Mark Graf","Sure. So last year, if you think about and we had a very similar situation, where we had it December rate increase. And in Q1 that resulted in about 10 basis points of an improvement in NIM. We actually saw 20 basis points of Q1 improvement last year about 50% of that was due to portfolio mix, the other 50% of it was due to the actual rate move. I think it will be rational to assume that that same 10 basis points plus or minus flowing through from the rate move we saw in December is not out of the realm of rational -- wouldn\u2019t be out of the realm for a rational person to assume, is kind of the way I think about it.","As we move on through the year, I think that kind of a cadence would hold, based on the current curve and the current expectations for promotional activity in the portfolio and the current expectations for interest charge offs. Right, so if you think about it the factors that are really going to influence it going forward are going to be, what happens market reach? What happens to the mix in the portfolio, both with transactors as well as with promotional balances? And then obviously charge offs have accrued interest flow through NIM, so that\u2019s a piece of that.","And then the other piece that probably kicks in at some point Sanjay and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough to tell you exactly what it happens, but at some point in time deposit data [ph] will come back into existence. You know these first few rate moves, we haven\u2019t seen, we've seen essentially deposit data [ph] of essentially zero. At some point in time that will creep in a little bit, but I feel really good about the NIM positioning through the year ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And maybe just one follow-up to a question I was asked previously. I mean cap ones talked about how the competitive intensity, domestic card lending is probably the highest it\u2019s been, yet you guys are accelerating your growth expectation. Can you just talk about why are being, why you're are so successful?","David Nelms","Well, I think if you look at our fourth quarter results, we fairly matched the increase in loan growth with increase in revenue growth. And I think that that is as I mentioned in my comments pretty different than what we're seeing in some other places, it\u2019s really easy to give away your product in terms of rewards to transactors that doesn\u2019t produce revenue or the dipping down credit [ph] that just gets eaten up in charge-offs.","But that\u2019s not our focus, our focus is on getting more our products into the hands of our prime revolvers and getting more usage in our portfolio. And so I mentioned that the greater number of new accounts last year was a big part of the increase in growth rate and that\u2019s everything from the new features, the advertising, the digital marketing. The new products like the secured card or expansion in student cards. And so as I think about this coming year, I think it will be more of the same. We are putting in more money, for more marketing, for more new accounts as an example.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","On the expense front, I know just you had indicated that the higher expense expectation is driven by the higher revenue growth opportunities. So on that, can you just give us your thoughts around where you think the efficiency ratio could go over time and how you may be looking at it for 2017. I know we're coming off a level of about 40% for '16. I mean do you think it remains around there, do you think you could actually see some improvement? Thanks.","Mark Graf","Yeah, I think you\u2019ll see some improvement as you head into 2017, my current though process is we wouldn\u2019t get all the way to the 38% target given the level of investment we're talking about driving this year, but I do think you get to a 39% handle next year, based on where I see the crystal ball right now. Don\u2019t take that as guidance, throughout the year that will change and our expectations there and everything else. But I think it\u2019s a reasonable expectation to have as we sit here at this point in time and we\u2019ll obviously keep you posted as we go through the year.","The other think I\u2019d really reinforce to support that is that, a big chunk of this increase in expenses is directly related to aggressive marketing dollars and if we don\u2019t see the returns on that investment that we expect, or if the environment turns on us, we won\u2019t hesitate to pull that back and that would obviously have a positive effect on the near term efficiency ratio.","John Pancari","Okay great and related to that, the increase in the rewards cost that you see through '17, I mean does that imply any abatement in the level of marketing spend, is that -- are you\u2019re going to lean on the accelerator there as well? Thanks.","David Nelms","Well I would say that, if you look at this past year, we had a similar order of magnitude increase in rewards cost and that is part of what produced the higher growth rate that we achieved this past year. So I think what we're kind of anticipating is some continuation of that trend. Some of it is just going to tend to happened as we get more of our customers converting in to Discover it, which has a higher average earn rate then our previous flagship product. And part of it is the continuation of our very successful promotional double match program and the 5% program that we're continuing to aggressively market and it's still a very good headline rate in a very good value to consumers who take full advantage for that.","Mark Graf","And even the rewards isn\u2019t an expense, it shows up as a counter revenue. We kind view that and the expense side as flip side to the same coin. They're both really about driving customer awareness, customer engagement, so we kind view marketing and rewards investments as inner changeable to integrate [ph].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Ho","Just want to talk about were the growth may be coming from a vintage stand point. I know you've done a lot of new customer acquisition with Discover it, it's been very successful for you. Just want to understand the mix of growth as it relates to that and kind of implications on some of the seasoning of that growth in your guidance for credit for 2017? Thanks. ","Mark Graf","Yes, David if you think back a few years ago, when we were talking at conferences and on conference calls, we were talking about roughly 50% of loan growth coming from new accounts and roughly 50% coming of the legacy back book. Defining new accounts is on the books three years or less for this purpose.","I would say today that mix looks more like, let's call it 75:25, 70:30, something in that range, skewing for the new accounts. So new accounts are a greater portion of the loan growth at this point in time and that does have some effect on the provisioning guidance. That said, I view it as thinking with an intermediate and a longer term mindset, a very positive thing, because in a lend-centric business model the way you compound the value of the business is to actually grow loans.","And I think the seasoning of loan growth that comes from new accounts is just a natural function of the business, the attraction of new customers into the franchise and natural funds for the business so. And I think I tried a really emphasize -- I think I really tried to emphasize at the end of it in my comments, that what we see is growth driven provisioning. As we look ahead growth driven credit drivers as we look ahead in the coming year. And not something that reflects any type of [indiscernible] in that credit environment.","David Ho","That\u2019s helpful, and then switching gears a little bit, back to the 5% rewards categories. It's been very successful, you guys started that category really and others have copied, but do you think the value prop could get diluted a bit by some of those categories like Amazon and department stores essentially having some of the private label players and co-brand players provide kind of ongoing rich rewards in those categories and some of those customers are rotating out of your 5% into those ongoing categories that they provide.","David Nelms","Well certainly we continue to evolve how exactly, what's in the various categories, how we market it and we're going to continue to keep this program fresh, it's changed a lot from when we originally launched it a number of years ago with the 5% program. And I guess I would say that it feels to me like notwithstanding a few examples like you mentioned more of the competitors seem to be moving to just the flat 1.5% than anything else.","So you know there's a few outliers, a few 5% there's you know, in one or two cases there is the 2%, but mostly it seems like it\u2019s the 1.5% and our 5% program works well there, and I think the proof is in the results. If you -- certainly the competition got a lot tougher last quarter and yet we accelerated growth and so we're going to continue to have that kind of focus to you know thrive in this competitive environment which I think is here to stay.","Mark Graf","And we very focused on an overall value proposition as opposed to competing on the basis of headline and rate, right. So it's also about ease of redemption, dollar threshold to redeem, we removed all those things. So it's not just about the what's the headliner and it's a thing, you actually use it, right. Then we also have merchant funded rewards as a result to having our own network, that kind of sit in there where we drive some incremental value that's funded by the merchants, [indiscernible] our P&L. So we feel the bias is fully going to be upwards, hence our guidance that we gave. But we feel really good about our ability to compete in that space without chasing headline or rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities, your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Two quick questions please Mark, and I know historically you guys have pointed to about half your growth coming from new accounts and half your growth coming from incremental lending from existing accounts. So I'm wondering with the investment and growth in new accounts that you've seen over the past recent periods, if that ratio has changed at all?","Mark Graf","Yes, it's running right now somewhere 75-25, 70-30 somewhere in that range. I don\u2019t have the exact number at my fingertips, but it's in that general range and as we continue to invest in and drive growth we would expect it to continue to remix slightly toward the new account side of the equation as well.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great, and then just one question to follow up on NIM, how should we think about the sustainable NIM with respect to the current forecasted Fed funds, et cetera. I know that in the past you've pointed to a 9-ish, on a 9% handle, has that moved sustainably higher in your view?","David Nelms","I would say the nature of the business model we did not move our long term targets on any of our longer term stuff in our call today, including that margin guidance. The real reason there is because I don\u2019t think, we can lose sight of the fact, we are at cyclical business and as we go through cycles, we will see NIM look different than it does today. That notwithstanding I would say absent a cycle, triggering it would be a long path from here to that 9% longer term guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Brendler","A question on the NIM guidance again. I noticed what looks a bit, but the cash advance volume was up significantly quarter-to-quarter. Just want to know how much of the reinvestment and marketing is going to be on seasonally rate market in the card business. And then also, I guess, I would think that personal loan portfolio doesn\u2019t really get the benefit of higher risks [ph]. And with the buildup [ph] there is that also a drag on the NIM going forward? Thanks.","Mark Graf","I would say, you are correct in the assumption that you had some higher promo rates in the -- prime promo in the mix in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s really more balanced transferred than cash advance, is what you saw coming in there. Than I would say we pulled back significantly on our balance transfer programs early in last year, it\u2019s part of what pullback our growth rates, because we weren\u2019t finding the right time engagement out of these programs.","I think we\u2019ve cracked the code or at least we believe we\u2019ve cracked the code at this point in time to be able to come back into market with a more robust balance transfer offering, but I would say balance transfers are far from the lynch pin associated with the growth strategy we\u2019ve laid out, they're a component of it. But really focusing on merchandise sales, building balances the old fashion way of customers engaging with the card and using products remains the core piece of the puzzle.","As a results to NIM, I would say the current level of promotional activity, that is contained in our plan and then we are moving forward with I would say is more robust than what we\u2019ve had years past, but that\u2019s fully contemplated in the NIM guidance that we gave in the earlier thoughts on this call that I provided in response to an earlier question about the trajectory. So I continue to feel very good about the way are our NIM is positioned, to be able to support both our growth initiatives, as well as create further value to our shareholder.","Chris Brendler","And the personal loan book? Any impact there was meaningful enough?","Mark Graf","I think you faded again Chris.","Chris Brendler","I just wanted to -- cards are mostly -- I would assume that personal loans are not variable rates. So you don\u2019t get [indiscernible] as a NIM. You\u2019re also growing that portfolio; it looks like pretty aggressively. Is that a rate based strategy or is there an easy in competitive environment, that caused the spike in growth, it sounds like there were some strategic changes and some breakthrough maybe that help as well. But it sounds like [Multiple Speakers] relative to guidance, so that\u2019s going to continue in \u201917?","Mark Graf","Yes. We do intend to continue growing the personal loan book as well, I think that\u2019s fair. It is a fixed rate book, but it is a very short duration book. It's somewhere two-three year kind of horizon if you will and we intend to -- well we don\u2019t match fund, loan-by-loan, we do think about our businesses holistically as we fund the balance sheet and I would encourage you to think of us as really kind of match funding. That personal loan book is the way we think about it.","So and given the short duration and the correct turn in that book it really doesn\u2019t have a deleterious effect on NIM to any significant degree. So I would say that again is contemplated in the guidance that we\u2019ve got out there. In terms of where the growth is coming from, no it\u2019s not rate driven gain. I would say it's coming from some product enhancements that David alluded to in his earlier comments and I would say, it\u2019s also coming from the fact that we have increased the maximum loan size we're willing to do there modestly, the maximum loan size we are willing to do there modestly at the $35,000 that\u2019s a modest driver as well. But it\u2019s really more the features and benefits and some of the product enhancement that\u2019s been the driver there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","The 10% year-over-year decline that we saw this year in your marketing and business development expenses that certainly support that you guys have indeed been more judicious with your investment spending relative to some other who've been stepping on the gas on marketing spend and perhaps not been getting as much return on that spend. But now as we look ahead at 2017 and think about now this increase that you guys are talking about in marketing investments that you have planned.","How do you ensure that you\u2019re getting an acceptable level of bang-for-your-buck on your spending? Maybe are there any principles underlying your investment spending that you could parse out for us. And I\u2019ll ask my second question because it\u2019s related, maybe if you could share any data points on how the cost per account acquired at Discover is trending versus the rest of the industry that would be great.","David Nelms","Well, on the first part of the question, Mark I'll let you do the second part. We are very judicious in terms of looking at what the expected marginal return is for every effort we do and whether it\u2019s segments that we're targeting in direct marketing or decisions that we're making in promotional rate duration or rewards investments, where we evaluate those and we do a lot of test and control, we back test to see how things are working and we decide whether to modify or extend things or curtail them.","So I think that the -- the thing that I\u2019m noticing, and I\u2019m sure other people do, somewhat the same. I think what someone of the mistake that I think sometimes people make is more transactors than expected, the interest income doesn\u2019t come through as expected and you've still got the expenses in terms of marketing or rewards cost. And I -- what I -- speaking from a lot of experience I think that\u2019s somewhat what I\u2019m observing elsewhere, where they\u2019re driving volume but not revenue.","Mark Graf","And with respect to CPAs, what I would say is we\u2019ve seen very, very modest increases in CPAs maybe 1.5%, 2% over the course of the last 12 months let's call it. We are very focused on CPA, we've deemphasized some of the aggregator channels, because we saw some real run there shall we say.","So I think in that basis, if you think about a card account when you\u2019re booking it and the long term value that card account, think of it like a NPV [ph] stream and that CPA that you\u2019re booking upfront, the value that -- the net present value of that card account is highly dependent upon what you paid to acquire it. So we are laser focused on CPAs and actively finding ways to drive growth in fashions that doesn\u2019t cause us to make crazy terminal value assumptions to make the NPV [ph] on these card account acquisitions work.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s excellent. Can you give the color on how that\u2019s trending versus the rest of the industry, because in particular given the comments that you guys made maybe there are some cases where the customer account could be elevated, but that retention of the customers isn\u2019t there and so any color relative to the industry, that you can give?","Mark Graf","So I would say, we don\u2019t disclose our CPAs, so I have to be really careful in terms of how I answer it. What I would say is looking at Argus [ph] and certain other data providers, who try and triangulate on us and estimate, I would say, if you exclude sub-prime, where the CPAs are very low, because these are very active credit secrets, right? So exclude sub-prime for second, focus on prime borrowers. The data that I've seen out there anecdotally would say other CPA's are considerably higher than our, but that is anecdotal and I would not encourage you to relay on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark DeVries","I was just hoping you could provide a little more color on what you mean by modestly higher in terms of total net charge-offs, should we expect something along the lines with the 30 bips year-over-year increases on the first quarter?","Mark Graf","So I gave a lot of thought to how to answer this question, because we figured it was coming. I guess what I would say Mark is, your bunny seems to have a pretty good nose. The way I was going to describe it was to say, well last year we describe we expected a slightly higher increase and it ended up being 15 basis points year-over-year. And the way I was proposing to answer this question was to say well modestly higher, probably means slightly higher than slightly higher.","So I would say, you're probably in the right relevant range. Somewhere in that neck of the woods is, based on everything we see right now, the right way to be thinking about it. And may be just the tad higher than that. But on balance again, its driven by the seasoning of the growth and not by a deterioration in the fundamental environment for credit that we see out there. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch ","I guess David, in most of the industry is actually growing spending volume several percentage points; 2, 3 percentage points faster than balances and you've actually got the opposite. So could you talk a little bit about actually how you're achieving that? Is that likely to continue over the next couple of years, how do you sort of think about that? And then I got a follow up.","David Nelms","We look at -- you would understand a lot more in the industry if you could really see what's going on with transactors versus revolvers by issuers, because if you could look our sales growth in our revolving base, the sales growth is actually very similar to the loan growth in our revolving base. So what's happening is, there is some people out there with very rich rewards that are attracting transactors and that\u2019s why, you're seeing it not cost us revenue and not build revenue, where that generally were proportional to the sales growth that they're achieving. So it's a remixing and it's a purposeful strategy on our part to focus on profitable business.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just a follow up, and when you look at those 5% categories. I think there are some people particularly, our side of the world here, who think of that as an area in which card holders tend to gains that or would focus their spending in those categories. So you're saying that you don\u2019t actually see that? That isn\u2019t like a source of, kind of excessive transactor activity?","David Nelms","I would say that, we have had a 5% program for a number of years and have good experiences with it. I think we would find it problematic to give 5% on everything without restrictions because the economics just would not work.","And so we have been -- we have used it to help engage our customers to give rewards in rotating categories that has helped to encourage our customers to use their Discover card across many categories versus just being concentrated in one or versus just gaining it as you're saying. But I think that -- look I mean we started -- we were the first rewards card there was back 30 years ago and so I'd say we have the most experience of anyone in the industry, we've seen people introduce things then have to pull them.","You know the original 5% program was actually, if you go back to the General Motors program which isn't around anymore and so you've seen some things that worked for a while in terms of volume, but didn't work from a profitability perspective and then they were curtailed. You haven't seen that from us, you've seen us be able to maintain a viable program even with the higher rewards cost that we've been talking about last year, we grew earnings a lot and so we\u2019re not -- we're balancing a great value for consumers and profitability.","The final thing I would say is you need to be careful, as Mark mentioned earlier, not to get hung up with just rewards. It is more than just the rewards, it's great service, it's other features, it's how you work with credit and make sure you're going to people that don't get over extended, there is a bunch of pieces here and rewards is an important, but just one piece of the puzzle.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks very much and congrats Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Vendetti with Citigroup, your line is open.","Don Vendetti","Yes, Mark, I was wondering if you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about capital return this year going into CCAR. I think you had made some comments about the debt rating agencies or debt markets being a binding constraint or the new binding constraint. It seems like investors are a little cautiously optimistic that if you get higher payout ratios, can you just talk a little bit about that?","Mark Graf","Yes, I think you know, last year again we had one of the highest total payouts and I think the highest effective yield amongst the CCAR participants, so we feel very good about the fact that we've been prudent stewards and are driving responsible loan growth and also trying to return excess capital that we don't need as effectively as we can, we have taken up our payout request to the CCAR process every year we've participated in it so far. I think it would be reasonable for one to expect we would not want to break that trend. So I think you should look for us to get more aggressive again this year.","We take with great happiness some comments that Governor Tarullo has made over the course of the last several quarters, where he's really talked about differentiating between the GSFVs [ph] and the -- what I'd call the mid-tier CCAR participant in terms of the expectations there and some thoughts around the qualitative process.","So I feel really good about what we've done in the past and I think you know we would look to get progressively more aggressive this year as well consistent with prior years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hesh with Jefferies, your line is open.","John Hesh","Evening, thanks very much guys and congratulations Bill. Question, is the ending payout of rewards 127 is pretty consistent with the overall guide for this year. So I\u2019m wondering number one, do you think at least in terms of incremental changes, the worse is behind you with respect to rewards expansion [ph] or is there some season and I'll admit, we need to think about with respect to the guide?","Mark Graf","There is definitely a seasonal element associated with it. I would say, a big piece of it is what is going on with our 5% rotating categories and what we choose to include in this category. So we choose to include warehouse clubs for example in our fourth quarter program that haven\u2019t historically been in there in the fourth quarter, in the past. So we will make decisions around engaging, the customer to drive the kind of behaviors that build the loan volume that kind of drives the profitability in the long run. So that piece of the puzzle definitely flows through, so you will see variability based on that.","The other big drivers really are going to be, obviously, the cash back mash program that we\u2019ve got running on new accounts is a piece that I would say that would be really more consistent -- be more consistent with the growth in new accounts, really just as we have every month another vintage that laps one year in the process and another vintage that's larger than the one that's leaving coming on, because thus far every year the vintage of new accounts has been larger than the ones that preceded it. And then the last driver is really going to be our legacy more card product, when we launched Discover it, all the new account acquisition since that point in time have come on it. So you also have a natural migration in the portfolio. A greater portion being it cards as opposed to more cards and they have a slightly more lucrative reward proposition associated with them.","So those were really the drivers. I'd echo David\u2019s comment, the increase in a full year basis this year is about right in line with the increase on a full year basis last year, significantly below the headline earn rates that you're seeing out of others and we like that, we\u2019re choosing to compete on our terms.","John Hesh","Okay. And then second question. Mark, I think you\u2019ve referred to kind of long-term loss rates in the 3% to 4% range in the credit card portfolio. And we\u2019re talking about moving -- it seems like you're moving towards 2.3% to 2.5% or some modest increase from last, this year. Do you think long-term rates, loss rates have changed because of certain factors in the business or it's just going to take a long time to get to the long-term range based on a benign credit environment?","Mark Graf","Well, I think that we specifically didn\u2019t update our long-term guidance and I think this has been a struggle for a while, because there were definitely some factors the changed after the card act, after the consolidation, after a number of structural changes in the industry. And we kind of gradually took down that long-term expectation.","Frankly, until we see a couple of cycles, we\u2019re not going to really know, and so we\u2019re hesitant to say what well the next cycle brings. But we are seeing this normalization that we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. It is slow and we continue to characterize it as a benign credit environment. And I think as long as unemployment rates stay very low and housing prices improve and the economy does well, you\u2019re going to continue to see below whatever that new peak is.","There will be another turn and when it turns, then we\u2019ll see what loss is go to in the industry, I don\u2019t think it will be the previous weeks at all, but you almost have to see it to -- for anyone to really know how it\u2019s going to behave.","John Hesh","Okay. I appreciate your perspective. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Grasek with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Betsy Grasek","Hey, couple of follow-ups. One is on you touch about the payout ratios, capital distribution. Could you remind us of what the capital ratios that you think that you could operate at if you didn\u2019t have the CCAR telling you what you needed to do. I thought it was in the 10% range, but maybe remind us of that and is that something as a goal you think over hit over the medium term. And the second question was just around mix between dividend and buyback and does your SKU change at all given how the stocks performed recently?","David Nelms","Sure, so I will say with respected to target capital ratios, historically you are correct in that the binding constraint has been CCAR and that was on the order of a 11% Tier 1 comment [ph]. I would say an economic capital analysis would show you, we need something more on the order of nine -- let's call it 9.5% Tier 1 comment. I think the ultimate binding constraint probably lies somewhere between those two experience, Betsy. And I don\u2019t have a sniper rifle estimate for you today. But I do think it is really rating agency and debt investor driven.","In terms of where that settles out. I think somewhere ultimately with some kind of a 10-ish doesn\u2019t feel altogether, maybe somewhere around 10, doesn\u2019t feel altogether wrong. But it\u2019s premature for us to really kind of revise guidance or kind of put that out there, but I kind of say that\u2019s the way they generally think about it. And obviously, we\u2019ll be working with rating agencies as our crack investor relations executive moves over to tackle that challenge, try and move their perspective on us as well over time.","The other piece of the puzzle I would say with respect to the mix between buybacks and dividends I would say we run a pretty rigid analysis of our buyback program on monthly and on a quarterly basis really building on an efficient frontier and making sure the returns in those buybacks look solid. I think given where we are right now we continue to feel good about a healthy buyback program. That said, we have said we do want to be a dividend achiever over time. So I think you would expect to see us to the extent the economics allow for it, we would look to consistently increase that dividend on an annual cadence, again to the extent the economics allow for it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.","Bob Napoli","Thank you, good evening and congratulations Bill. On the regulatory cost, I was wondering if you could give us some feel for what -- how much of regulatory cost have been decreased from pre-recession levels and how much they could decline if you were to remove from regulatory costs, those costs that you view as probably not being beneficial -- incrementally beneficial to the regulatory side or to Discover?","David Nelms","I would -- I think we're not prepared to give any kind of specific guidance on this. I would just say, I would characterize it as I feel like a lot of the build has occurred whether it's [indiscernible] specifically or regulatory CCAR, whatever. It feels like this year is going to be a little more analyzation of some of those expenses as we continue to ramp up very quickly this past year.","But I would caution on thinking that it is going to go back to anything close to what it was pre-down turn, at least for us and I think for anyone. And frankly, I believe that some of it is going to be a big payoff for us. Because if we can have better quality controls to put in projects right the first time, to have things work more perfectly for customers every single time, to have better, more scientific understanding of our capital and what's important and what are the different scenarios.","It's a lot -- we've become much more sophisticated then that we used to be and I think there are -- we focus on the cost and yes, you have to do it because you have to do it. But I think that, what we need to do is pursue efficiencies, but also pursue the -- even more importantly pursue the benefits that come from better controlled process. In much the same way, it's almost like, think about six sigmas [ph] in manufacturing. There is benefit that can come from this and we need to focus on that. ","Bob Napoli","Okay thank you, and just on your student lending business. Obviously, any thoughts on your discussions with your contacts in Washington DC on the potential dramatic expansion of the TAM available to you in that market or the potential for that to happen. I mean you've seen obviously the student loans stocks go through the roof and continue to do so, and some of your competitors and you guys would obviously be a beneficiary if those stock moves are indicative of the opportunity to come?","Mark Graf","So to be clear you're talking about the student loan business, the addressable market?","Bob Napoli","That\u2019s right.","Mark Graf","Well I would say that, if there is more room, I mean the private student loan market has become pretty small and I think that\u2019s one reason that number of people exited from it and why there is only a couple of people left in it. And I think to the extent that, that there was a greater role for private lending. I think we would be very well positioned and I think the fact that, I think it\u2019s the round 6% or something of the total market and new loans are private and the other 94% or so are federal. And so it wouldn't take much in the way of federal backing of, to have a dramatically percent increase on the private origination side.","And it is a very specialized business, from a credit prospective it's unique, from an operational prospective it's unique, because its distributed through schools with tight controls for it being used for educational expenses. There is a lot of regulations specific to it. And so I think it would be hard -- I think that we would feel really well positioned to take advantage of any possible increase in that market. Which I wouldn\u2019t expect this year but may be in subsequent years.","I guess the final thing I would say is we've been investing a lot in the infrastructure, we\u2019re converting to a new system a little later this year in that business, which I think would be very scalable and flexible to be able to take advantage of whatever opportunities may come in future years.","Bob Napoli","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up, this wasn\u2019t clear to me. Do you think rewards competition; do you see signs of it peaking or do you think it\u2019s another -- there is another step-up from there? I mean obviously Sapphire cut their rewards pretty dramatically on the origination, on the new account side?","David Nelms","I am seeing, for every sign of someone cutting back, I\u2019m seeing something else that goes the other direction. I would just say some of these programs, whether you\u2019re paying out a flat 2%, which uses all the interchange or you\u2019re paying out a flat 5%, which uses over double what your income coming in is. Some of these programs just don\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense in the long-term to me.","So I think the economics are going to causes this to be a peak maybe we're around peak now. I just, I feel like it\u2019s already gone kind of further than I would think that the economics really support, for some of these programs. But I think it\u2019s going to be a while before people cut back and part of it, as rates go up and cost of float for transactors become non-zero and as people see that what the actual mix coming in, in transactors versus revolvers and what\u2019s canalization of their own portfolios versus really new, people will than start to adjust and probably cut back some other programs to more reasonable levels.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities. Your line is open. ","David Scharf","Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in. If I heard correctly, it sounded like your NIM guidance is factoring in the expectation of more rate hikes later in the year. I\u2019m just wondering switching to the regulatory side and as we think about your loss rate forecast. Are you building in any expectations of using regulatory -- using in the collections front and how should we think about some of the developments there?","Mark Graf","The simply answer to that question is, no. We\u2019re not building in any expectations there at all. And I think we tend to be a pretty conservative straight shooting bunch. And at the end of the day, I wouldn\u2019t know how to create those expectations that I would feel comfortable laying into a loss forecast. And I think as we get more clarity on some of the proposals that are out there in terms of regulatory reform and everything else, we\u2019ll obviously be reviewing them and looking at them and trying to process where they all outcome together. But I think we need decisively more clarity on where all those things end up before we can rely on them, let's put it that way.","David Scharf","Got it. And along those lines from a strict operational standpoint, one of the likely areas of change we seem to be hearing more or more about is with the new SEC nominee, is that the PCPA [ph] may reverse its ban on auto-dialing, predictive dialers, any automated technology for reaching cell phones. I know some of the debt buyers and collection agencies tell us that that represents a much greater C-change the collection productivity than anything the CFPB [ph] has been weighing on them. Since all of -- you don\u2019t sell any charge-offs, so since you\u2019re operating, I assume all of your collection activities in-house. If you were to -- if the SEC were to allow the use of auto-dialers and other automated technology for reaching cell phones, is that something that can be implemented rather quickly or is that more along the lines of, let\u2019s say a year loan project?","David Nelms","No. I think that could be implemented fairly quickly and easily. It would -- in fact we\u2019ve had to spend a lot of money and go to a lot of trouble to restrict the normal operation of these things. And so it\u2019s a lot easier to tale that out. And I would say that one of the things we\u2019ve been doing is moving very heavily to digital collections and so that\u2019s less impacted by some of this.","But it is definitely hard as so many people are using their cell phones as their primary phone. They don\u2019t have landlines anymore and the fact that we are required to have consent and then the fact that we've had to turn off our auto-dialers has introduced inefficiencies, which is driving up our expenses and it\u2019s also frankly caused some of our customers to not be able to get into payment programs that we may offer or the assistance we can provide to them, help them get back on their feet.","So I think it would be a great thing for consumers, if we were able to reach them to help them stay current or get current, and it would be a great think for our operating cost and our collection results. So that would be a positive.","David Scharf","Got it. Thanks very much.","Bill Franklin","All right. That concludes our call. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us. And I\u2019ve enjoyed working with all of you. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to call the Investor Relations Department. Have a good night.

My name is Bakiba and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin. Bill Franklin, you may begin.","William Franklin","Thank you Bakiba. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin as always with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the second quarter 2014 earnings materials which are posted on our website and have been furnished to the SEC we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussions.","Our call this afternoon will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated.","So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David Nelms","Good afternoon everyone and thanking for joining us today. After the market closed we reported second quarter net income of $644 million or $1.35 per diluted share, up 13% over the prior year. This was driven primarily by profitable loan growth and share repurchases. We also continued to deliver strong performance with return on equity of 23%.","Our direct banking business continues to deliver solid results and slide four of the earning presentation shows Discover\u2019s total loan growth of 7% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in card, personal loans as well as student loans. Card receivables growth of 6% this quarter continues to outpace our peers. We are achieving increased wallet share with existing customers and adding loans from new accounts as well. Our Discover card sales growth also accelerated to 6%.","The overall value proposition of Discover continues to resonate with customers as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit new account growth year-over-year. Additionally, we added some new designs for the card and we rolled out a new cash back reward card primarily to appeal to students. Speaking of students, during the second quarter we enhanced our student loan products by introducing a 1% cash reward for students who achieved good grades. Additionally, in the quarter we announced new lower rates for students applying for loans. We launched an in-school repayment product and we began testing the consolidation student loan product, all of which are showing positive results to-date.","Shifting gears, Discover was recently named the winner of three Call Center Excellence Awards by the International Quality and Productivity Center for demonstrating superior thinking, creativity and execution across the full spectrum of call center functions. I think this service excellence is one of the reasons why we have some of the lowest customer attrition in the industry. And to further enhance the customer experience we implemented our new core banking platform over Memorial Day weekend which supports all of our deposit products. The flexibility and the operational efficiencies that we expected to provide are fundamental to our vision to being the leading [direct] bank.","Moving to our payment segment, volume increased by 3%. During the quarter, two of our newer emerging payment partners went live with transactions. However, I\u2019ll remind you that it will take some period of time for partners to achieve scale. As we have previously discussed, Pulse continues to deal with pressures on volume and margins due to competitive challenges in the debit industry. Despite two consecutive quarters of positive growth we learned that we would likely lose significant volume from a large debit issuer beginning in 2015. While the prospect of losing some business down the road is disappointing, this loss is not material relative to the profitability of the total company.","With that said we are very pleased with the branding and superior returns that our network helps drive for our card business and we do remain focused on improving third party volume over the long term. Lastly, as we previously discussed in the second quarter we entered into a consent order with the FDIC related to our AML and BSA compliance programs. The order does not include any civil money penalties but provides for program enhancements.","In addition, the Federal Reserve has recently notified us that it also intends to enter in to Supervisory Action with the company regarding our enterprise-wide AML and BSA compliance programs. We are committed to resolving these issues with the regulators in a timely manner.","Before I turn the call over to Mark to walk through the details of our second quarter results let me say it that I am proud of our record rate EPS, card loan sales growth and our ability to continue to drive solid revenue growth with expense discipline. Mark?","Mark Graf","Thanks David. I\u2019ll begin my comment today by going through revenue detail on slide five of our presentation. Net interest income increased $159 million or 11% over the prior year due to continued loan growth as well as higher net interest margins. Total non-interest income decreased $28 million to $583 million primarily due to lower direct mortgage-related income and lower protection product revenue. Given our suspension in protection product sales revenue related to these products continues to decline, albeit at a slower pace than initially expected.","These items were partially offset by higher net discount and interchange revenue which increased by $19 million, or 6% year-over-year driven by higher Discover IT Card sales volume. Our reward rates for the quarter was 91 basis points which is higher than last year due to greater standard and promotional rewards, but down from last quarter which included a decrease in the expected forfeiture rate.","Payment services revenue for the quarter was flat year-over-year. Overall, we grew total company revenues by 6% for the quarter.","Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.42% was up 18 basis points over the prior year driven by higher card and private student loan yields. The year-over-year increase in card yield primarily reflects a higher portion of balances coming from revolving customers as well as lower interest charge-offs. The year-over-year increase in private student loan yield is the result of better than expected performance in certain acquired pools of loans.","As we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, under PCI accounting favorability is recognized over the life of the underlying loans via an increasing yield and that\u2019s what happening here. Overall higher total loan yield combined with lower funding costs resulted in the 40 basis point increase in the net interest margin over the prior year to 9.84%.","Turning to slide seven, total operating expense decreased by $23 million or 3% over the prior year, mainly due to the decline in other expense, which was somewhat offset by an increase in headcount and professional fees. The decline in other expense was caused by the absence of $40 million in Diner\u2019s Club charges which we incurred last year. For the quarter our total company efficiency ratio was below 37%, more than 1% lower than our long-term target, due in part to the timing of certain expenses throughout the year.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide eight, provision for loan losses was higher by $120 million compared to the prior year due to a $23 million reserve build this quarter compared to a $78 million reserve release during the second quarter of 2013. The reserve build mainly reflects our continued card loan growth. Sequentially the credit card net charge-off rate increased by one basis point to 0.33% and the 30 plus day delinquency rate decreased by nine basis points to 1.63%.","The private student loan net charge-off rate excluding purchase loans was down one basis points sequentially to 1.3% and the 30 plus day delinquency rate decreased by 13 basis points to 1.66%. Overall the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in-line with our expectations.","Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was down 12 basis points sequentially to 1.95% and the over 30 day delinquency rate was down two basis points to 66 basis points. Overall we remain pleased with our strong credit results. One last item I would call out in the income statement is that during the quarter we had a favorable resolution to some outstanding tax matters. And as a result our 36.6% effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated.","Next I will touch on our capital position on slide nine, our Tier 1 common ratio increased sequentially by 30 basis points to 15.2% due to solid earnings. During the quarter we repurchased $177 million of common shares. One of our top priorities is to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. To that end we still plan to repurchase a total of $1.6 billion of common shares for the four quarter period ending March 31, 2015, the same amount as our CCAR capital action submitted to the Fed.","Also on slide nine is our outlook for 2014, which I would simply say remains relatively unchanged from the guidance we gave back in February at our financial community briefing.","So to summarize, during the second quarter we continue to build on our momentum established at the beginning of the year. Discover drove better than industry loan growth, net interest margin continues to be above our long-term target, the credit environment remains benign and we are effectively controlling our expenses.","That concludes our formal remarks today. So I will turn the call back to our operator, Bakiba to begin the Q&A session. Bakiba?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question is coming from the Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays","Yeah, thanks. Question David, to what do you attribute the 6% card loan growth above the high end of your guidance? Is that, you\u2019re actually seeing signs of acceleration in spend across the industry or is it better than expected traction from the marketing of Discovery card? And then could you actually see it potentially remaining above that rate for the period, or is that a level growth that you at some level would think might outstrip kind of your desire to grow here?","David Nelms","Well, to answer your second question we are not prepared to revise our 2% to 5% long-term target. I mean I am certainly pleased that we actually were a bit above that target this quarter. And I mean you\u2019ve just seen our various competitors announce and I\u2019d say generally I certainly didn\u2019t see that much signs of acceleration across the industry. So I think we continue to gain market share. So I would say that you mentioned the success of Discover IT, that is certainly contributing. But some of the other things that are contributing are lower charge-offs, less attrition, some wallet share build with existing customers as they respond to many programs and higher levels of service, as well as I mentioned growing \u2013 putting on more new accounts, and we are getting loans on the new accounts.","So I think we are kind of hitting on all cylinders and it\u2019s showing up in loan growth. And we also saw our sales growth accelerate to 6% this quarter which is the best in a number of quarters.","Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays","Okay, great. And just a follow up on the guidance around reward expense margin give you are still at some of the 100 basis points for the year. I think the first half of the year is only been about 95 bps. Should we assume that there is going to be greater promotional activity in the back half of the year, that\u2019s going to bring you closer to 105 for the back half of the year or should we consider this conservative guidance there?","Mark Graf","Yeah. I would not interpret it as conservative guidance. I would say I feel really good about that guidance. The area of 1% is the right way to think about it. If anything Mark for the year it may trend up a basis points or two higher than that. So I would say it remains good guidance.","David Nelms","But to answer your seasonal question you\u2019ve seen as in year ago, this was a fairly light quarter and then we tended to pick up more moving in to the holidays. And we\u2019d expect to do the same this year.","","Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Sanjay Sakhrani. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Thank you. I guess you guys built reserves this quarter, and I was just wondering, as we look out, should we just expect that you guys will continue to build reserves? And maybe just on a related note when we think about the seasoning process from the growth that you\u2019ve booked over the course of last 1.5 years, I mean kind of where are we with that process? I mean when do we start seeing that actually be somewhat of a headwind in the face of kind of stabilization in credit? Thanks.","","David Nelms","Sanjay I will try and answer this and do them justice here. I would say from a reserving perspective, reserve trajectories still feel like they are being driven by growth. The credit environment, the backdrop itself still feels relatively benign. We don\u2019t see any fundamental churns out there at all. So quarter-over-quarter there might be some variability in that. I think as we said before the gap is pretty prescriptive in terms of how you actually set the reserves. So on a 1.6 billion we may [bill them] 21 and release 20 the next quarter is the way I think about it. We are just sitting flat bumping along the bottom with those kind of relative numbers.","In terms of seasoning and where things are going to come out, what I would say is we\u2019ve been generating real strong loan growth now for over three years. And in light of that if you think about the way our card loan seasons you typically tend to see peak charge-offs somewhere between month 18 and month 30. So we are already well into the seasoning process on the first two years, on those vintages of growth, which I think really speaks to the quality of the loans we are attracting, really underscores that we are operating first of all in a benign credit environment but then really with respect to us, I think it really underscores the fact we focus on a prime bar and the quality of that portfolio that we are building.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, right. I am sorry, one just quick follow-up. Has that the profile of the currency you book changed over the course of the time, I mean have you guys tried to broaden it out a little bit more?","David Nelms","I\u2019d say overall the quality is quite consistent.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks very much. Just a follow-up on the growth. How should we think about the sequential growth, David just given the trend that you\u2019ve mentioned which is sort of above standard growth for three years in a row. It\u2019s starting to lead to dis-inflating sequentially growth rates. So how should we think about that dynamic?","David Nelms","Well, I\u2019m not sure I follow exactly your sequential question. I guess see if you\u2026","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Sorry, in credit card the sequential growth was about 3.5% versus the 6% year-on-year growth right?","David Nelms","Yeah, well obviously the card business is seasonal. So I personally think the better way to do it is to look at it year-over-year which removes that seasonality and we have been operating near that the high-end of the 2% to 5% target for a while now and I guess this is the first quarter that we have actually broken through that and are above that. I wouldn\u2019t promise that we are going to remain above it but I certainly would suggest that we are going to be at least at the high-end here for a while because I don\u2019t see any of the positive trends that we are achieving, reserving in the next quarter or two.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. And Mark if I can just ask one quick follow-up question do you happen to know the dollar amount of the tax benefit in the period?","Mark Graf","I don\u2019t have it at my fingertips. We can follow-up and get that to you.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yeah, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that our next question is going to come from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup","David you had made some comments about the loan growth. As we look at some of your competitors, I mean it looks like there is a fairly consistent I guess you could call it an uptick in loan growth but it sounds like maybe you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re not really seeing that or is it more you just want to be cautious because it\u2019s a small uplift, I mean are you seeing any increased demand for credit from customers or is it \u2013 and we understand that you\u2019re definitely gaining market share, just trying you know parse it out a little bit more.","David Nelms","Well, I am not exactly sure what you are looking at but from our biggest competitors what I\u2019m seeing is that American express is the only large competitor that\u2019s growing close to our levels and the other largest issuers are sort of plus or minus 2% kind of ranges. So I am not seeing an overall industry pick-up to sort of our levels of growth. So it looks \u2013 the industry as a whole looks pretty flat. I mean maybe the industry has moved from minus 1% to plus 1% or something but it\u2019s still darn near flat and so I am very pleased with our 6% growth with a flat industry.","Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup","Got it. And then into July, the spend has that held relatively steady?","David Nelms","It has, the last two months of the quarter and then continuing into this month are pretty consistent with that 6% overall quarter year-over-year. So feeling good about seeing a little higher growth sustaining for now.","Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that our next question is going to come from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, good afternoon guys. Mark when I think about the trajectory of the net interest margin, just thinking back to last year, I think there was an expectation of decline in the first-half and then improvement in back half of the year. So while you\u2019re starting base obviously a lot higher at this point just given the seasonal tailwinds that you sometimes see in 3Q, should we expect to see the margin begin to expand again from its current levels?","Mark Graf","Yeah, right. I would say, I would expect flattish is the right way to think about it from where we sit right now for the remainder of the year. I think there are some puts and takes in there. I think from a loan yield standpoint I think flattish is the way to think about that one. I think we have a little bit less funding cost tail wind, if you will in terms of the maturities that are rolling off and little less pick-up on some of this going forward. But I would say we actually would have some margin expansion this quarter just to be transparent with our investor base.","I think we had three basis points of sequential contraction that\u2019s because we chose to take some of the goodness we\u2019re seeing right now and use that to position ourselves to perform well when the environment turns and you have a rising rate situation is well. So we consciously did some of that and I would except you might see us do a little bit more of that as the year goes on. So I would stick to the flattish NIM guidance as you look to the year.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And is that driving higher sensitivity to rates, when rates do eventually raise?","Mark Graf","Over time, yes it will.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then Mark just have one unrelated question, on credit you know when I look at the recovery numbers it looks like we are seeing no signs of slowing. I guess relative to your initial guidance from last year are you seeing any changes on recoveries, obviously they are coming in better if they do continue to come better is it safe to say that we could actually see credit improving over the next couple of quarters.","Mark Graf","Yeah, I would think about recoveries in two different buckets Ryan. The first bucket is what I\u2019ll call the recoveries on the pool of charge-offs from the recession, right. And as we have said before we have continued to realize that recoveries off that bucket for a much longer period of time then you would following a normal downturn. Usually by the time you\u2019re 24 months past a charge-off your recoveries have really peaked and they tail off pretty quickly thereafter. And we\u2019re five years past that point in time and recoveries are still coming off that book and I would say they\u2019re coming at a \u2013 they\u2019re attriting at a much lower rate than we would have guessed as you pointed out.","So overtime clearly that\u2019s a finite book, it will attrite, right. So I would over time it\u2019s happening slower than we expected but that attrition will take place. Then you have to look at the new charge-offs that are flowing into the pipe, if you will to refill that bucket and I think it\u2019s a really good thing that we don\u2019t have many of them today. So the fact that we are just not charging-off a lot gives you limited potential for recoveries against a much smaller book of charged-off accounts. So the recovery rate itself when you pass it up a new charge-offs is very good as it\u2019s ever been, the recovery rate on that static pool from the crisis will attrite overtime.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, thanks for taking my questions.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from David Ho of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A quick question on expenses, you reiterated the guidance for the year for $3.3 billion of expenses. If I take the first-half run-rate it seems to imply that the second-half will be up about 6% year-over-year. Is that just kind of the timing of marketing and a little more build another expenses and comp? And how much has the mortgage business been right sized, have cost come out of that business as you\u2019ve seen kind of a tick down in revenues there?","Mark Graf","Yeah, I would say $3.3 billion still feels like a good number on the full year. There is some definitely some seasonality in the expense base, there is no question about that and there is some back end load. I would say with respect to the mortgage company specifically I feel like we have taken the right actions there at this point in time to position that business. Well it\u2019s still burning a little bit of money but not a real measureable amount to be honest, at least not anything that shows up at the top of the company in a meaningful way and we are continuing to work on positioning the longer term strategy with respect to that business within Discover but I feel like we have taken the action that needed to take there.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks. And just following-up on Ryan\u2019s question about asset sensitivity increasing, can you remind us what percentage of the books is variable rate loans and of that how much do you expect to be able to re-price or realize the rate changes in a high rate environment?","David Nelms","Yeah, I think there is bunch of moving pieces in there David. What I would say is I think an immediate parallel shock of 100 basis points to rates produces something on the order of $130 million roughly was our last quarterly disclosure. We\u2019ll obviously update in our new Q as well. The vast majority of the loan book is floating. The card book floats at this point in time. Some of the student loans effects and the personal loans as well. So I don\u2019t have the exact rate down at my fingertips but the vast majority of the book is a floating rate book.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right. And you think that would probably rise with the deposits being a little more sticky and the assets being re-priced?","David Nelms","Yeah. I think the one thing we have talked about and I think we just need to continue being transparent about is if you want to continue driving sales growth at some point in time there probably is a cap on some of your floating loans some of the card, right if you are going to charge 40% for cards you are not going to get a lot of field usage but we\u2019re far, far away from when we think that begins to kick in.","David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right. Thank you for taking my question.","David Nelms","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Bill Carcache from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead your line is open.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thank you. Good evening. I had a follow up question on expenses, in particular your revenue growth outpaced your operating expenses by over 9% this quarter. I know you guys have an operating efficiency ratio target but I was hoping that you could discuss how you guys are thinking about positive operating leverage as we look at the business beyond this year and into next, is there any kind of a commitment to growing revenues faster than expenses at this point in the cycle or is it really all about the efficiency ratio and expenses overtime will go up or down with revenues?","Mark Graf","The way I would think about it is to really look at the fact that we\u2019ve been investing pretty heavily over the course of the last couple of years, take advantage of the goodness in the environment. So part of some of the negative operating leverage you\u2019ve seen over the course of last couple of years has really been driven by that fact. I can assure you that David is laser focused on positive operating leverage and making sure that revenue growth outpaces expense growth over the long run. I think there is quarters where we will, there is quarters where we won\u2019t by virtue of what\u2019s taking place in that given quarter.","So I would say we will anchor to that efficiency ratio but we are always striving for positive operating leverage in the business model.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","So then just mathematically to the extent that overtime revenues are growing faster than expenses and there could be overtime some potential for that efficiency ratio target to move lower?","David Nelms","Yeah, I might comment that we expect some positive operating leverage but probably more modest than what you just cited and I think that one of the things Mark just talked about taking expenses down in for instance home loans and that sort of a one-time event that\u2019s impacting us benefiting us if you will at this time but on the flip side we\u2019ve got higher regulatory related cost and so I think the way to think about it is we\u2019ve established 38% efficiency margin and we expect to roughly maintain that.","It could possibly go the other way at some point because if we see great marketing opportunities we might choose to go the other way. So we are not promising positive operating margin or operating leverage whatever but if we get off that track it will be for a good reason and for a limited period of time.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Understood and thank you. If I may on a separate note you guys haven\u2019t had any inverse receivable for the trust in the long time and you\u2019ve talked about this in the past but I think in looking at it I don\u2019t believe that any of your originations from 2009 to 2014 are in there so balance has been gradually decreasing. I\u2019m just hoping maybe you could briefly touch on how you are thinking about the trust and how it fits in the packing order of funding preferences here? Thanks.","Mark Graf","Yeah, it\u2019s great cost effective funding for us to issue a card ABS. What I would say is we have a significant excess of receivables in the trust overall we need for the planned issuances at this point in time and that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t seen it contribute any new assets for the trust in extended period of time. So when we get into \u2013 should we get into a situation where we, we would be running up against capacities, we\u2019d obviously be willing to consider putting more receivables in.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Great. Thank you.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Moshe Orenbuch out of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. I was intrigued David by statement you just made about if you found kind of great marketing opportunities here, you are at a point where you weren\u2019t materially increasing marketing expending you are outgrowing, you are outgrowing the industry, your sales volume growth is accelerating and your cost not certainly well within the range of what you said out. I guess to turn that question around is I mean what, what could you be doing to make it even better, is there anything that could be done here and kind of maybe just if you could talk on just how you assess the credit, the kind of competitive state in your market?","Mark Graf","Well I think we have a disciplined approach to thinking about marginal cost and marginal benefit and we look at that across all of our businesses and across of our programs. And so we think that we\u2019re at a pretty optimal point here and, and so at the margin, we think we have diminished, you know payback from incremental investments and, and that we\u2019ve actually been able to focus as much on a fixed efficiency and effectiveness to outgrow the industry, not doing flips in the industry. And I think what you spend in marketing maybe it\u2019s important but what your product is, the service the back seat that rewards program how good you are at direct marketing and of course we focus all of our efforts on direct, we don\u2019t have channel comp liquid branches and all that. Those things are just as important. So we\u2019re constantly evaluating incremental opportunities and killing things that aren\u2019t payback and adding things to do.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just a follow up if you I mean if you were to do something where it would fall short, would it fall short on terms of the cost to produce it or the credit or the spending performance where you think that would be?","David Nelms","You know it\u2019s typically in the cost per new account or cost per incremental marketing effort relative to the loan balances and spending and credit performance that you get.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good. Thanks very much David.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Chris Donat out of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead your line is open.","Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Had one follow up on the word spending just the seasonality what the second quarter this year being lowest so far and as I look back in last three years second quarter has been the lowest quarter as percent of card sales volume. Is that solely a function of the, the quarterly cash back bonus program or is there something else going on in that seasonality?","Mark Graf","It\u2019s primarily related to 5% and other promotional programs. And, and...","Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Got it.","Mark Graf","And the, single factor is what categories are we promoting and we tend to you saw last year we promoted online thing, and big categories like online and department stores therein times and people are doing their holiday shopping and such and then will typically do things like gas programs during the summer and so on but that still tends to a smaller overall category.","Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay, and then just a follow-up on a comment that Mark had made, sort of tacking on in answer to question there, additional spending that you due would be for a limited period of time, like I said think about the run rate you are on for this year at 3.2 so things are looking at just to spend on to get to their $3.3 billion of annual spending or operating expenses. That\u2019s on the variable side right it\u2019s marketing now if you are looking a higher, a whole bunch of new people or anything that would recur immediately in 2015 right?","Mark Graf","Yeah. I think you should rightly assume the vast majority of it, the vast majority of it is variable, that\u2019s the right way to think about it.","Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Got it. Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Bob Napoli. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon. A question on capital, I know you said you are going to buyback the same amount of stock but I was curious why you didn\u2019t buyback you know as much as you look at your capital level, a way to use that capital that can be and I guess the Fed is more comfortable with is some M&A and I just don\u2019t know I mean you guys have been as you\u2019ve mentioned time and \u2013 rewarded investors with discipline and are there opportunities to use that capital in a strategic manner that would add additional growth, long term growth opportunities that you\u2019re comfortable with and are you looking hard, I guess?","Mark Graf","Why don\u2019t I start the answer that one and then I\u2019ll pass it over to David for more specifics. First of all why we ended up buying a little bit less this quarter I would say Bob we haven\u2019t got into the habit of talking about when we\u2019re in the market, when we\u2019re out of the market, why or how much. So I prefer not to get selective on that. I\u2019d rather just say we\u2019re going to \u2013 our plan is to take out the $1.6 billion over the course of the four quarter rolling period.","I would say with respect to our approach and our appetite for M&A I would just remind you before I pass things to David, our capital prioritization stack, it\u2019s first and foremost organic growth. It\u2019s secondly returning it to shareholders which as you rightly point out under the current CCAR process is somewhat constrained these days.","Third, it would be financially attractive portfolio acquisitions. They\u2019ve got to be financially attractive because by definition they are tied to their portfolios, so I would say that would be a piece of the puzzle. And then fourth on that prioritization list would be M&A because you introduce the key man retention risk, the diligence risk the integration risk all those other different pieces of puzzle that the others don\u2019t bring forth. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re pretty disciplined around the way we look at M&A, in terms of what we might be willing to consider David I\u2019ll pass that to you for\u2026","David Nelms","Well I would just reinforce that we\u2019re primarily an organic growth story and the reason for that is there is a. I think a limited set of opportunities that would directly fit with our direct banking and payments partner strategy.","Secondly, we have achieved a very strong returns in our business and therefore the hurdles as we think about where to put our incremental shareholder\u2019s capital, we tended to find more opportunities to actually grow organically and build shareholder value in that way.","And thirdly, we do \u2013 while we\u2019ve done some M&A overtime we do approach it with a fair bit of skepticism and there is a lot of cases where it has \u2013 M&A has detracted from shareholder value versus building that hand. So we\u2019re going to be very cautious in approaching that. I guess the final thing I\u2019d say is that I do think that the \u2013 we\u2019re playing a long term game here and I think that it\u2019s likely that as regulators and institutions get more comfortable with the new approach and the new levels of capital and the processes in place that some of this sort of constraints may loosen up overtime and so it\u2019s important not to have money burn holes in our pockets because we may be able to return more of it overtime.","Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Great. And just a quick follow up I guess on the credit card business. Have you\u2019ve been adjusting credit lines. One of your competitors has moved to credit line increases and I think we\u2019ve seen some of that in the Fed data. Given the strong credit, is that a way to get growth, have you been doing, adjusting credit lines or anything else on the credit side?","David Nelms","Our line increased strategy hasn\u2019t changed material over the last couple of years.","Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Brian Foran. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hi. Good afternoon guys. I guess on loan yields I kind of asked the same question last quarter and you gave a pretty good decent detailed answer on kind of the broad industry dynamics. But I mean I guess when I look at it I mean you\u2019ve got a banking industry where loan yields are 4% and falling fast. You\u2019ve got you guys where loan yields are 11.4% and not falling at all. I mean is there anything you are seeing on the horizon that would lead to increased competition for those loan yields, it\u2019s just you\u2019re in a remarkably good spot where you\u2019re actually able to grow revenue as you\u2019ve grown loan balances, so obviously the risk is that changes?","David Nelms","Well, I think that it\u2019s more a factor of the fact that we focus on direct banking and on more profitable products. And so I think that if you compare our card yield to other card yields we still look attractive for one reason. We don\u2019t charge off as much interest as competitors with higher loan losses but it\u2019s a lot closer. And as we have expanded into other businesses student loans are \u2013 is a lower yields than other unsecured loan types but it\u2019s still above secured loan types such as mortgages. Personal loan also tends to be below card but still it\u2019s a lot closer to card than other banking products.","So one of the direct banking strategy has a lot of benefits picking and choosing which products you offer and which you don\u2019t is one of those and we have been judicious in that. I guess the final thing I\u2019d say is where else we have been disciplined. We\u2019re disciplined on our use of promotional rates. We\u2019re disciplined on focusing on revolvers and if you have lot of transactors in your book you tend to suppress the yield because you have zero earning assets in there and we\u2019ve been judicious on credit because writing [enough] interest also deducts from that yield.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","As an unrelated follow-up there is a lot changes going on in private label card and can you just remind us how you think about that business long-term as something that potential part of the roster, so to speak?","David Nelms","I think we\u2019ve said overtime that, that could fit the strategy if we ever found an appropriate entry path but the entry paths are very limited and we have not seen any to-date. So I would think about that as opportunistic. Could it happen someday, yes but it may never happen and it\u2019s not a critical product in the way that direct check-in or even some of our mortgage products are to thinking about being a leader in direct banking. It\u2019s more of a nice to have if an opportunity ever happens, but private label has had a rebound of late but still if you look at the long term it\u2019s not necessarily growing relative to general purpose cards and it\u2019s a more limited market sized in general purpose cards and so I think there is only room for a more limited set of competitors to offer that kind of product.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Craig Maurer out of CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Craig Maurer \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Yeah, good evening. Thanks. At the Investor Day, you had talked about looking to significantly enhance your portfolio of spend centric products to try to leverage your network and I was just wondering where you stand in that thought process? Thanks.","David Nelms","I actually don\u2019t remember that comment. I think we certainly have talked about continuing to enhance and differentiate our core card products and I feel very good about Discover It which is our flagship product, the free FICA scores have been very well received by consumers and not widely copied by competitors. In fact I think we\u2019re still the only one to offer it on the statements. We\u2019ve added some security features that are somewhat unique in the industry as an example. We\u2019ve put in the ability for consumers to turn their card on or off with a flick of a button online if for instance they misplaced their card which I am not familiar with other competitors having that. We\u2019ve continue to enhance the rewards program as well.","So we\u2019ve, I think what you heard at the Investor Day was us talking about our focus on good credit quality revolvers and that one of the things that differentiates us is it seems like a number of our competitors are really chasing transactors that look good in today\u2019s rate environment but is not typically driving revenue and that\u2019s one of the reasons you\u2019ve seen in our revenue go up and other card companies go down in revenue because the transactors simply don\u2019t produce as much revenue.","Craig Maurer \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from David Hochstim out of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Yeah, thanks. I wondered, David can you give us a sense of the mix of the contributors for loan growth, you mentioned new customers and existing customers and have you done anything with, is there any change in teaser rates and promotional rates this quarter?","David Nelms","I would say our loan growth continues to be quite balanced. We are getting loan growth from new customers. We are also retaining customers and getting higher level of activation and engagement out of existing customers. So we have not done anything dramatically differentially in teaser rates. One way you can see that if you haven\u2019t seen a big change in yield. And so pricing has held up even as growth has held up and even accelerated a bit. So we are constantly testing, adjusting by retaining a very disciplined and balanced loan growth and we have not \u2013 in our opinion the quick change your credit or change your pricing could drive a spurt of growth but is not \u2013 is easier to execute but the executing a differentiated strategy with all of our customer service, onshore, inside that company better service levels that drive better retention of balances is the way to get both good credit results, good yield and loan growth overtime which ultimately leads to profits.","David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay. And then Mark is there, are any tax benefits coming in the second-half and what\u2019s good estimate for the effective tax rate in the second-half?","Mark Graf","I would use 37.5% as a good estimate for the effective tax rate in the second-half. We always have as any large company does open matters before various taxing authorities and so the possibility always exists but I am not banking on any, how about that.","David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Jason Arnold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good evening guys. I was just curious if you could comment a little further on the competitive side. Are you seeing any competitors doing anything for more aggressive rather or ordinary versus prior periods at all?","David Nelms","I would say that different players are coming in and out in terms of aggressiveness. The general trend in recent years is \u2013 there has been huge shift towards everyone focusing on rewards and in particular cash reward but that\u2019s partly because it\u2019s working, consumers love it. They\u2019ve seen competitors see our success and want to get some of that if you will. But that\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not a new trend. What we have seen is this year you know there\u2019s one or two competitors that have picked-up their marketing intensity and there is one or two players that have actually reduced their marketing intensity on cash kind of rewards. It is expensive to offer, it is what we focus on and we focusing on delivering great value at affordable cost of the company which allows us to sustain it over the long-term.","And I think one of the things I\u2019m really proud of is how well our top-line advertising is working. Our consumer testing shows that we are getting some of the best results in years and our marketing campaigns are more effective for a given level of spend then our competitors so our commercials and sponsorships like the NHL are working harder for us and that is really helping.","Jason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great. Good to hear that. And just one another unrelated item I know we are still somewhat early on but can you give us an update on the cash back checking product and how things are going there?","David Nelms","Sure I mentioned you know we launched cash back checking last year in a limited cross-sell and what we told everyone at the Investor Day is that we really wanted to get our core banking system in place before we started to really scale that. I mention that we put that in successfully during Memorial Day so we really feel good that it\u2019s going in well and so we are just about a point that it will start ramping up but will be ramping up in a cross-sell manner.","We \u2013 there is a new system has allowed us some new capabilities to make it easier to offer to most of our current base and obviously with a large customer base that represents about a quarter of U.S. household that will be the place that cross sell will be the most cost effective to expand it from this point. We have not yet made a decision as to when we are going to launch beyond our current customer base. It\u2019s entirely possible that the rest of this year we are going to focus on and expand cross sell and it maybe next year before we go broad market but stay tuned for that.","Jason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Terrific, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And that our next question is going to come from Vincent Caintic out of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Vincent Caintic \u2013 Macquarie","Hi, good evening. On the gross interchange rate, I\u2019m calculating a 200 basis points rate for this quarter which is higher than it\u2019s been at least since 2011 and despite the lower rewards expenses. I was wondering if there is any one-time or kind of second quarter items there that we shouldn\u2019t think about as a run-rate or this is a kind of good jump start for the rest of the year.","David Nelms","Yes, I would say there is a couple of different things taking place there. First of all as we did a re-class of certain merchant fees in the first quarter so a part of is being is reflective of that re-class that was done. The second piece of the puzzle I would say is just the spend mix over the course of the quarter and the spending tilted more toward merchants with higher discount rates this quarter and a way for merchants who have lower discount rates. So, I would say that tends to move back and forth quarter year-over-year. It feels like MDR is in a decent range at this point in time.","Vincent Caintic \u2013 Macquarie","Got it, it makes sense. And follow-up actually on the lowering yield questions that were asked previously and I will take it through another track. You mentioned with the card loan yield to start the lower interest charge-offs were a meaningful benefit to that. So, if you kind of a normalize with the credit being taken out of the equation, do yield point towards a downward structure or how should we think about that? Thanks.","David Nelms","Yes, all right. I was just going to say if you take credit out of the equation yield feels pretty stable. Just look at the ALM positioning we have had for the company we positioned ourselves to absorb the initial phases of rate shocks to our funding cost base. We continue as I mentioned in my commentary in the margin we continue to push out our funding, extending maturities fixing rates positioning ourselves for that so the funding cost component a yield feels pretty good. The actual card yield itself feels pretty good the actual asset yield themselves feel pretty good the stated yield on the product. So it\u2019s really just the interest charge-offs that are the other piece of variability. I would say if you exclude them, feel very stable.","Mark Graf","And remember that\u2019s stable in the shorter-term, we still think over the longer-term we would expect credit to normalize somewhat and then that would push the yields down closer to the levels that we have talked about in the past.","David Nelms","But that would come through the charge-off line as opposed to the stated yield in the asset or the funding.","Vincent Caintic \u2013 Macquarie","Got it, thanks very much guys.","David Nelms","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And that our next question is going to come from Sameer Gokhale out of Janney Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital","Hi, thanks. You know a couple of questions I guess my first one was, you mentioned one of the competitor who is growing faster than the market or at a decent clip and of course you are growing a pretty good clip in the card business and it looks like most of the larger card issuers really aren\u2019t seeing that much growth on the year-over-year basis. There is a one company Wells Fargo which is actually growing faster than even you are and of course they have a much smaller loan portfolio.","So what I am curious in getting your thoughts on is they\u2019re growing faster than the industry, faster than you are smaller portfolio but I was wondering how we should think about the competitive landscape as they continue to grow. They seem to be taking more share away from your competitors but at some point I have to believe there is a trickle-down effect to the extend your competitors are forced to spend more marketing to defend share then you have to spend more. So how should we think about that? Are you in such a different target market that really doesn\u2019t affect you? Just your thoughts will be helpful?","David Nelms","Yes, I think that we\u2019ve typically referred to the big six because that includes us because there has been such a big gap between the six of us and the next one. We have increasingly started tracking Wells Fargo to a much greater degree. They are growing faster by rate from a smaller base. And I would expect that to continue. And I think over time we may get to a point where we talk about the big seven as opposed to the big six.","That being said, it\u2019s branch-driven. I think it\u2019s probably a wider credit box than we have, they are not national. So we are not bumping up against them in national Internet and direct mail campaigns to as much degree. We are not bumping in with them with national advertising the way we are with really most of the big six. But still they will, as they take share of the total market they will become more of a player. So I expect that it\u2019s likely to may be impact the other branch banks more because they are following that strategy. But it will also have some competitive impact on us.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital","Okay. That\u2019s a very complete and helpful answer. Thank you. And then the other question I had was you answered the question about industry competition and growth in several different ways. And I was wondering if you think that loan growth for the card industry will ever get to 5% plus level? I mean clearly you are there. But you haven\u2019t raised your target range. But it seems like unless there is a significant pick up in personal incomes or something that makes consumers more optimistic about borrowing more and lenders more willing to lend, I just can\u2019t see that dynamic ever changing with industry growth overall exceeding 5%. So I mean is that consistent with your view or do you feel that at some point we really could see the industry growth overall accelerate? And what would drive that?","David Nelms","Well, I think we could see some acceleration from the really non growth today that we are seeing. I continue to believe that it will accelerate to be roughly in line with GDP. And so low double-digits, may be not 5%. Even a couple of percent growth would be a meaningful change from where this industry has been. And I think what\u2019s driving that is, I think the de-leveraging is largely complete with consumers and competitive changes in the market place.","And then I would expect credit card to grow more with the economy with incomes, with retail sales. And I don\u2019t see \u2013 if you look at the times when the industry grew really fast historically it was when balance transfer was introduced or when credit was standard for reduced. And I don\u2019t see either of those trends happening to have a fundamental change going forward.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital","Okay. Then it sounds like we\u2019re on the same page. So appreciate your perspective. Thank you.","Operator","Great. Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time.","David Nelms","All right. Thank you everyone. As a reminder the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any additional questions. Have a good night.","Mark Graf","Thank you all.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Craig Streem","Thank you, Erika. Welcome everyone to this afternoon. We will begin as usual on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations Web site, investorrelations.discover.com.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear on today's earnings press release and the presentation. Our call today will include formal remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, covering 2019 full year and fourth quarter highlights. And then John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And when John completes his comments, there will be plenty of time for a Q&A session. And please limit yourself, if you don't mind, to one question and one follow up so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Hochschild","Thanks, Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing the highlights and key performance metrics for the full year. Then turn the call over to John to review fourth quarter results as well as our guidance elements for 2020.","2019 was another very good year for Discover with net income of $3 billion after tax or $9.8 per share, and a healthy return on equity of 26%. These results reflect our business model that brings together the positive attributes of high return consumer lending and direct banking with the benefits and long-term potential of owning our own global network. Our robust returns allowed us flexibility to return excess capital to our shareholders, while continuing to make important investments in the Discover brands' advanced technology and expanding our acceptance globally. These investments have further strengthened our competitive position in 2019, and set us up for continued strong returns in 2020 and beyond.","Looking at some of the specifics. Total loans grew 6%, in line with our expectations. And credit performance was also on target, as we benefited from the continued strength of the U.S. consumer and ongoing advances in our risk management and servicing capability. We achieved a robust net interest margin of 10.41%, and operating expenses remained in our targeted range. The economists are forecasting continued growth in the economic environment in 2020. However, given the unprecedented duration of the economic expansion, we will manage credit with that in mind.","We continue to invest in our global payments business in 2019, focusing on expanding acceptance by adding network partners and relationships with acquirers in key markets like the UK, New Zealand, France and Spain. Our payment services segment generated 24% increase in pretax income, primarily driven by strong volume gains from our PULSE business. The team at PULSE had a great year, adding volume from acquirers and both existing and new issuers.","Turning Slide 4, we had solid loan growth in all our products, with total loans and card loans both up 6%. In our card business, the majority of this growth was in higher yielding merchandise balances as opposed to promotional activity, reflecting strong card member engagement. We continue to introduce features and service enhancements that are relevant to customers and prospects, including for example, leveraging merchant partnerships to provide even greater value to our partners.","We also had a good year in our student lending business, with organic receivables up 9%. Loan growth is benefiting from increased awareness of the Discover brand, enhancements through acquisition models and improvements in the conversion process. We continue to benefit from our strong position as the second largest provider for private student loans.","Our personal loan portfolio grew 3% in 2019, a touch above our expectations. Our investments in analytics and modeling have had a significant impact on our personal loan credit performance, enabling us to increase originations, while maintaining an acceptable level of credit risk.","Turning to Slide 5, credit performed very well in 2019 and was in line with our expectations. The seasoning of loans from recent vintages was the primary driver as the impact of normalization in the consumer credit industry continues to abate. As I said earlier, we feel good about the underlying economic and credit trends as we enter 2020, and we'll have more to say about overall credit environment when we discuss fourth quarter performance and 2020 guidance later in the call.","Before I turn the call over to John, I want to wrap up by saying how excited I am about our prospects for continuing to create value for Discover's customers, team members and shareholders. We finished 2019 on very solid footing, generating outstanding returns by combining solid loan growth and effective credit risk management. I'll now ask John to discuss our financial results in more detail.","John Greene","Thank you, Roger and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on Slide 6, looking at key elements of the income statement. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 5% this quarter, driven primarily by 6% increase in average loans. Provisions for loan losses increased 5%, mainly driven by loan growth and to a lesser extent by ongoing supply-driven normalization in the consumer credit industry. Operating expenses were up 7% due to higher compensation expense and continued investments to support growth in collections, digital platforms and advanced analytics.","Moving to Slide 7. Roger already covered the key loan metrics. But I wanted to emphasize that the majority of the growth in card receivables came from standardized merchandise balances, with a smaller contribution from promotional balances. We expect merchandise balances will continue to be a primary driver of card growth in 2020. Just under 70% of the increase in receivables was from new accounts with the remainder from existing cardholders. Looking at student loans, total receivables were up 3% from the prior year with the organic student loan portfolio increasing 9% year-over-year.","Turning to Slide 8. Volume on the Discover network rose 5% from the prior year, in line with growth in the Discover card spending. Within our payment services segment, PULSE volume increased 6% over the prior year, driven by strong performance in key product.","Moving to Slide 9. Net interest income of $2.4 billion increased $122 million or 5% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher loan balances, a higher revolve rate, lower promotional balances and a favorable funding mix as we continue to grow lower cost direct-to-consumer deposits. This was partially offset by the impact of a lower average prime rate in the quarter, an unfavorable funding rate reflecting maturities of lower coupon brokered and direct-to-consumer deposits and higher interest charge-offs.","Total noninterest income was $520 million for the quarter, up $15 million or 3% year-over-year. The primary drivers of the increase were higher loan fees and an increase in transaction processing revenue. Net discounts and interchange revenue was up $281 million or 1%.","Turning to Slide 10. Our net interest margin was 10.29% for the fourth quarter, consistent with our expectations. This was down 6 basis points year-over-year and 14 basis points sequentially. Relative to the prior year quarter, the decrease in NIM was due principally to three factors; first the unfavorable funding rate I just mentioned; second, the impact of a lower prime rate; and third, higher interest charge-offs. These were partially offset by a higher revolve rate, BT fees and a favorable promotional balance mix. Relative to the third quarter NIM decreased 14 basis points due to the impact of lower prime rate and an unfavorable funding rate, partially offset by a higher revolve rate and BT fees.","Total loan yield decreased 7 basis points from a year ago to 12.52%, primarily driven by 12 basis point decrease in card yield reflecting prime rate decreases and higher interest charge-offs. This was partially offset by a higher revolve rate, BT fees and lower promotional balances.","On the liability side of the balance sheet, average consumer deposits grew $3 billion in the quarter and now make up 55% of total funding. Consumer deposit rates decreased 13 basis points from the third quarter as we actively managed our funding costs lower. Although market observers expect a stable Fed funds rate this year, we'll remain vigilant for opportunities to prudently manage our deposit and other funding costs.","Turning to Slide 11. Operating expenses increased $74 million or 7% from the prior year. Employee compensation was $33 million higher, reflecting staff increases in technology, as well as higher average salaries and benefit costs. Professional fees were $24 million higher, mainly driven by third party recovery fees. Cost to support investments in analytics also contributed to higher professional fees. The $20 million increase in information processing was driven by our continued investment in advanced analytics and infrastructure cost.","Turning to credit on Slide 12. The takeaway here is that overall credit performance remains stable and well within our risk and return expectations. Total net charge offs increased 11 basis points from the prior year with the primary driver continuing to be the seasoning of loan growth and to a lesser extent, the supply driven normalization in consumer credit.","Credit Card net charge offs increased 18 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points from the prior quarter. The credit card 30-plus delinquency rate was 19 basis points higher year-over-year and 12 basis points sequentially. This was another solid credit performance in our card business, reflecting our disciplined underwriting and line management.","We saw a modest uptick in student loan charge offs as portfolio seasoned. Student loan credit performance continues to be aided by efficiency gains in collections, including expanded outreach to co-signers. In personal loans, charge offs rose in the quarter consistent with typical seasonal pattern. The 30 plus delinquency rate was down 23 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points compared to the third quarter. We continue to see credit improve as a result of our prior credit tightening and improved fraud detection.","Before leaving the subject of credit, I wanted to preview an additional disclosure and trouble debt restructuring you'll see in our 10-K. To provide greater clarity on the growth in our TDR receivables, we will now report that balance of receivables to have successfully completed programs. At December 31st, we had total credit card TDRs of $3.4 billion, up $1.1 billion from the prior year. But in fact, over half of the $1.1 billion increase was from customers who had successfully completed a program. In account number terms, this equates to above an 80% success rate. This demonstrates that our modification programs are an important aspect of helping customers through temporary hardship and also benefit Discover by reducing overall credit costs and enhancing revenue.","Let's turn now to Slide 13. Our common equity tier one ratio decreased 20 basis points sequentially, reflecting loan growth and capital returns, partially offset by strong earnings. Our payout ratio, which includes buybacks, was 77% over the last 12 months. And as we noted earlier, average consumer deposits now make up 55% of total funding.","Slide 14 provides a summary of 2019 business performance compared to our guidance for the year, and against 2018 performance. You'll see green check-marks against each of the metrics, and I want to congratulate the team for its solid execution against all of our key financial objectives for 2019.","The following slide provides a summary of our outlook and guidance for 2020. First, we share the consensus view that the macroeconomic environment will remain stable. We do not see any indicators that point to a recession next in 12 months. We expect the U.S. consumer to remain healthy and unemployment remaining near the current levels. We also note that household debt service levels are at a 40 year low, an indication that consumers remained financially resilient. Based on these factors, we've assumed no Fed rate changes in our 2020 business plan. This backdrop sets us up for another year of profitable growth and strong returns.","Now turning to the specific guidance elements. First, we expect loan growth to be in the range of 5% to 7%. Next, we expect operating expenses to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, as we continue to invest for future growth with incremental spending on our brand to increase awareness and considerations. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 3.3% to 3.5% percent this year, reflecting a stable credit environment and the seasoning of our growing portfolio.","Our target CET1 ratio continues to be 10.5%, which remains an achievable target under CECL due to the phase-in for regulatory capital purposes and our capital generative business model. I'm sure you've noted our list of guidance for 2020 is a bit shorter. In fact, we've taken a fresh look and decided to no longer provide specific guidance on rewards rate for NIM.","The rewards rate can vary quarter-to-quarter depending on the 5% category. The annual rate has been increasing by around 2 to 3 basis points due to the ongoing shift from the more card to the card, and we expect this trend to continue. In terms of NIM, the single largest driver of changes in net interest margin has been Fed actions. Given this, we've elected not to provide specific guidance but we'll comment on the other drivers, such as deposit beta and spending patterns as part of our quarterly earnings calls.","So with that, I'll move onto the topic of CECL. On the last earnings call, I indicated that day-one adjustment would be towards the north end of the 55% to 65% range we'd guided to. We now expect our adjustment to be approximately $2.5 billion or 75% above the year end incurred basis.","In terms of the day-two impact, the reserve change will depend upon the mix of the business, economic outlook, overall credit performance at the point in time in which quarterly estimates are determined. Additionally, the seasonality of our business will impact quarterly reserve changes and could introduce some volatility from one quarter to the next. As you've seen, our business model is capable of generating high returns, which should enable us to largely offset the capital implications of CECL overtime.","Wrapping up on Slide 16. In 2019, we generated 6% total loan growth and delivered a robust 26% return on equity. We had a very strong year in our consumer deposits business with growth of 22%. Credit remained in line with our expectation and return targets, and we executed on our capital plan by allocating capital to loan growth and share buybacks. In conclusion, 2019 was a strong year and we're very pleased with our performance and positioning for 2020.","That concludes our formal remarks. So I will turn the call back to her operator Erika to open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","So John, thanks for the updated day-one outlook on CECL where you said 75% increase. I guess first, what is driving that higher from the initial guidance? And then second on last quarter's call, you mentioned the day-two impact on the reserve builds to be higher than day-one since you\u2019re adding new accounts that don't have any incurred loss. The message is slightly different from what we've heard from others. So I just wanted to get sense, one, how should we think about -- does the fact that you're growing faster and adding more accounts factoring to that faster day-two impact, or is there something else that's impacting it? Thanks, and I have a follow up.","John Greene","So let me start with day one impact. I think as I said one the last call, my take was team did a fantastic job in terms of modeling and preparing for CECL implementation, and that view still hold very, very strongly. The initial guidance, 55% to 65%, included a number of factors. And as we came through the fourth quarter, we took a look at the modeling, the performance of the portfolio and specifically recovery assumptions. And we ended up revising a recovery assumption that had to do with overall recoveries taking a look at most recent history, which was certainly stellar performance and we moved it back to the middle point of the observable history on recovery. So that was the primary driver of change in day-one.","In terms of day-two, I said on my first call third quarter that day-two would be higher. And certainly in the third quarter was higher as we modeled, and that increase had to do with the amount of volume, we put on the books related to our student loan products, which in terms of day-two impact has a significantly higher impact than day-one would under incurred basis.","Now, that actually points to some of the volatility that we're seeing in CECL. So as we take a look at all our product and the relative mix throughout the year, I would say a good proxy for day-two would be that range around 75%. So it's slight nuance on the initial message that I provided. But I would also caution that that's a preliminary number and we're working through it. And there's a bunch of dynamics that impact CECL, including the macroeconomic outlook, portfolio performance, mix of products that we're putting on the book in any one quarter and obviously, the delinquency and the rates that we're observing, so a lot to consider there. But I hope I've provided enough specificity to be helpful as you think about how to model this business.","Ryan Nash","And then I guess a follow up for the both of you. So if I look at the expense guide and that was about 7.5% to 12% expense growth, which is ahead of I guess expectations and where you are running. So first, John, can you be size what are some of the incremental investments? And Roger, are there any one off investments in here that you feel you need to make for this year? Or are we entering into a new phase of elevated investing? And then second, how should we think about seeing the paybacks from these investments?","John Greene","Ryan, I'll start and then Roger I'm sure will have a follow up. So I'm going to start with by editorializing a little bit here. So if you look at the efficiency ratio that this company has generated overtime, it's among the lowest in the industry. And then if you also look at the returns in terms of return on equity, we are among the highest in the industry. And one could use those two data points to make a simple argument that perhaps we've under invested over time, given how much -- given the returns that we're generating.","So as we put the plan together for 2020, we looked at where it was appropriate to invest, where we thought we'd generate the best long term returns for our shareholders. And there was there was two items specifically. So investments in brand around awareness and consideration and that's a meaningful number to be around $100 million, believe or not. And then also continued investment in our infrastructure to add functionality and ensure it's appropriate from a scale and resiliency standpoint going forward.","Roger Hochschild","And maybe just to build on what John said in terms of the payback. Some will be more immediate, so drive our car continued strong loan growth but others, we expect multiyear returns. And as you think more broadly about our expenses, I'd say it's sort of a dual story of efficiency but then also investments. And so the vast majority of the expense lines are close to flat year-over-year, as John and I look across the P&L. We're looking for our efficiencies in terms of our marketing expenses, so our CPAs that we're targeting across the different products. But we are investing significantly around building the brand and also building brand awareness of some of our non-card products, as well as some investments in technology that we think will be very helpful in driving growth in the future.","John Greene","And then just one follow up comment. So this company has a rich tradition of effectively managing costs and certainly my background, I've had my share of cost management and analytics to ensure we are going to get a payback on these investments. So as Rodger said, some of these are longer-term, some of these are shorter-term. We will continue to monitor and ensure that for every dollar we're spending, we're getting appropriate paybacks for our shareholders.","Operator","We will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess I wanted to dig in again on day-two impact related to CECL. So I was wondering, John, if you could give us a little bit more to help us sort of triangulate on how we should think about the provision for 2020?","John Greene","So I've guided around that 75% figure as a sort of poster and anchor as you think about day-two. It's early, as I mentioned in my last comment, Sunjay. So I would say for the year, that's a decent way to think about it, it might be a little higher, might be a little lower. And in terms of quarter-over-quarter, you know the third quarter we originate a lot of student loans and that day-two will certainly exceed the 75% number that I just mentioned. So mix will be an important factor of it. But beyond that, you know I don't know if I'd be doing any one of service by being more specific.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And then on the other guidance data point around loan growth and not getting a whole lot on NIM and rewards rate. I was wondering if we think about loan growth and what revenue growth might do in relation to loan growth. Is it fair to assume that it should be fairly commensurate, i.e. there's not significant factor that would lead to a different direction than what loan growth would suggest, or am I thinking about it incorrectly?","John Greene","No, I think you're definitely in the right direction. So there's a couple of things that I just want to point out. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we assume no Fed rate changes in our planning assumptions. So if that changes, that certainly as it has historically and been a problem from a forecasting standpoint, that would impact NIM. We're also -- I alluded to this in the prepared remarks, in terms of our focus around deposits and increasing the level of overall funding from direct-to-consumer deposits, which are cheaper funding service.","I also mentioned that I think there is some over time we will continue to work to see what we can do in terms of the cost of deposits, making sure that we're originated the deposits at an appropriate level that fund the balance sheet towards our longer-term target, but also being very mindful of the cost of funding. So if things went well, there could be a basis point or two on the deposit side. That's your call whether you want to put that into your model. And then in terms of pricing action, the company has been pretty stable, but we will continue to look for opportunities on the pricing side.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Pancari from Evercore.","John Pancari","I just have a question on the TDRs, and know you will be giving us more disclosure in the K. But I wondered if you could give us of the $85 million loan loss reserves build that you recorded for the quarter. How much of that was related to TDRs? And then separately, do you have what the delinquency ratio was for the TDRs for the quarter?","John Greene","So for the quarter, we previously said this and it remains consistent that from a TDR standpoint only 5% are more than 90 days delinquent so that's remain consistent, so performance there, no major change. In terms of reserve provisioning, we\u2019re probably not going to break that down on this call. I don't know that it would be super helpful and if I did, it would take the balance of the call, that's kind of walk through the nuances of it. So we will pass on that one if you don\u2019t mind. Sorry, I can't be more specific, John.","John Pancari","No, I get it, that\u2019s fine. I guess one more on the TDR topic. Just given the increase that you cited, up $1.1 billion year-over-year that's about just under 50% increase and then TDRs were up 9% linked quarter it looks like. What are you seeing differently in your -- the makeup of your card base that you, that Discover is seeing a much larger increase in the usage of TDRs versus a lot of your peer institutions. I know you can't really talk too much about what the peers are seeing. But the increase in TDRs has certainly outpaced that of other lenders in the space.","John Greene","So let me start off by saying that we have some really solid analytics around our TDRs. And we test populations and once those tests come back and show that indeed cash flows are improving, we'll open it up to certain population. And then we will observe that and then we will adjust accordingly based on any differences we see between test populations and when the TDR specific program is in process. So I'm not really going to talk about what other folks are doing.","There also is an approach that we take where we think that, and we've seen real differences in terms of outcomes for our customer base, in terms of helping them work through some difficulty and they end up, some 80% of them end up sticking with us, have their credit lines open backup and continue to be very, very satisfied customers.","So what around the edges, we're going to take a look at smaller account and see if the effort to make a TDR is worthwhile based on our beliefs in terms of what's going to happen in those particular populations. But these are good programs. The financial impact is taken as soon as we TDR, they remain in the delinquency buckets that they are in unless they have made three successful payments.","So what you're seeing flow through the financials is exactly what you would hope in terms of overall good credit performance and a solid book and TDRs is an approach to work with customers and help cash flow.","Roger Hochschild","And maybe just to build on that. There has been a lot of noise around this, and so that's part of why we decided to add the disclosures to help provide you more information and kind of give us more insight into the way we see it. You know a better way to classify it might be, not just TDRs but customers who have ever been in a TDR. And so the growth, really some of them, will have returned to prime will be getting line increases et cetera and are well into the book. It just happens to be the way we account for these is once a TDR always a TDR. So that's why we think these new disclosures that you see in the K will be very helpful.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","My question is what are the implications of the 10.5% CET1 target for the end of 2020, which I believe is kind of what you guys have indicated, you think you should operate longer term on the payout ratio as we look beyond 2020 and sort of to factor in the continued phase in of the CECL impacts along with continued loan growth?","John Greene","So I'll take this and maybe Roger will have a comment if that's appropriate. So when the team set up the original target for CET1, they did that with the idea that indeed CECL would be implemented and would impact the overall capital plan for the year 2019 through the first half of 2020. So we are going through our beginning our CCAR work and we're going to make the submission, and we'll get some feedback likely in June. And we'll use that coupled with our overall plan around capital allocation that we'll review with the board to make a determination of what the future dividend payout ratio and buyback programs will look like. I would say this.","So as we look at CECL for 2020 and our capital generative business models, we can likely absorb over the short term based in the phase in and long term the impact CECL. Now there's questions regarding our regulators and how CECL will impact the consumer finance industry especially given its pro-cyclical nature and the fact that products with longer lives, such as student loans and certain home equity products and even to a lesser extent personal loans. In a tough economic environment, certain lenders might not look like the profile of that that will impact the availability of credit. I will say this, we like our products under Cecil and under the current FAS5 methodology. So it's based on the cash flow, CECL is not impacting the cash flows. And we like the return profiles that we've generated historically and will in the future.","Roger Hochschild","And to build on that from our discussions with regulators, I wouldn't interpret the phase-in as just delaying the pain. The Fed has indicated to us that it's designed to give them time to see how CECL is impacting different financial institutions, and that actually they feel like the amounts of loss of absorption in the system currently, i. e. pre-CECL, which is capital plus provision, is appropriate. So we'll see how that comes out. But again, I wouldn't just necessarily view it as something that's going to phase-in and that's that.","Mark DeVries","So Roger, does that imply that there is some room for the Fed to potentially say now that you've got greater loss absorption capacity kind of post-CECL that maybe the 10.5% isn't the right level that maybe you could go a bit lower?","Roger Hochschild","I would not predict what the Fed is going to do. I can just say what I've heard directly from them, which is they feel like pre-CECL the lost absorption is right for the system as a whole and that the phase-in is not just spread it out overtime, that actually gives them time to figure out what they want to do. So I'd say, all we have to stay tuned.","John Greene","And the other kind of party that will help form this will be the rating agencies. And you know we spend some time with the rating agencies in December, and the view there is at least my take, my personal takeaway is that they're going take a look at equity and reserves as in the aggregate. So I don't see any major implications at least in the short-term there.","Operator","We will take our next question from Eric Wasserstorm from UBS.","Eric Wasserstorm","I have a question just about credit. You know I heard your commentary about broad-based stability, but also we're seeing a few other trends too, such as you know higher interest charge-offs and investment in collections, higher late fees. There is a TDR experience that you cited, the interest rate seems high but there is plenty to add just to growth in TDRs is also very large. So I'm just trying to put all of those pieces together to understand kind of how to really think about the credit experience over the near-term horizon.","John Greene","Yes, I wouldn't worry about straining a bunch of things together. I think we've talked about the TDRs and are adding more disclosures so that hopefully that will help you see them the way we do. In terms of investing in collections, I think that's something that makes a ton of sense just about any time but certainly late cycle. But that's something we've talked about, I think pretty consistently for multiple years there. So if you are trying to spring those data points into a bigger story, I'm not sure that's something I would agree with.","Eric Wasserstorm","And maybe just transitioning topics for a moment in terms of the investment expense that you've highlighted. Is this an expense that you are thinking about over a specific horizon, or should we just think about the overall efficiency ratio of Discover as just being a little bit different going forward than maybe what the recent historical experience has been?","John Greene","I think we've provided guidance for what to expect for 2020. My guess is going beyond that, we'll continue to invest in growth. But I'm also optimistic about our ability to find efficiencies as well, especially leveraging some of those investments on the technology side around robotic process automation, around advanced analytics. So we're not prepared to really give guidance beyond 2020. But you can rest assured we'll be looking to see what we can find on the efficiencies side to help fund investment in growth.","Operator","We will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. ","Moshe Orenbuch","Sort of following and I appreciate Roger that you're not interested in giving guidance beyond that. But if you put together the comments that you do expect to pay back from those investments and obviously the efficiency ratio, given you're likely to see revenue growth in between 5% and 6% at most there is going to deteriorate in 2020. I mean should we take from that the inference that at some point it should be improving, or can you discuss that a little bit?","Roger Hochschild","Actually, it sound like you're asking for long-term guidance. No, again, as I said earlier, we're not giving guidance beyond next year. But I did want to make it clear that you shouldn't necessarily take that as a run rate number. And we do believe, to the point John made, as efficient as our model is compared to the rest of the financial services industry, we believe there's further efficiencies to be gained by deploying some of these advances in technology. So we're not also saying that you can just continue to print the number for 2020.","Moshe Orenbuch","And maybe just to take that idea, because I\u2019m not a huge fan of the ideas that well, because it's lower than others, we should want it necessarily to be higher for some period of timing. You talked about the high level of returns, but it's not like we're seeing degradation in that, it's not like that it was running down. So maybe talk a little bit about what are the things you saw that you know made this the right time to take that stand on expenses?","Roger Hochschild","I think it\u2019s a very good point, Moshe. We don't manage the business to an efficiency ratio. We manage our expenses to be as efficient as possible. But then also look to invest and drive growth, but some of those too really is the entire expense base and drive the calculation of efficiency ratio. But to the extent we see opportunities to make investments to drive accelerated growth and we feel good about the payback, as John talked about, we will do that and communicate that as appropriate. But I think your points are good one, you don\u2019t honestly just manage the business to an efficiency ratio.","Moshe Orenbuch","No, I don\u2019t think so and I guess I look forward to having a future discussion about seeing some of those gains coming in on the revenue side.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Mihir for Jason. I just had a -- maybe we could start with just CECL, just want to make sure we understand you. And given I think you mentioned CECL has a differential impact on some of your products, particularly on day-two and then as we go into the quarters. Does that change the way you think about those products and also just relatedly in terms of just the disclosures you will be providing. Are you going to provide disclosure for the next several quarters so we can compare results on a more apples-to-apples basis?","A - John Greene","So in terms of how we think about our products, we think about them from a cash flow standpoint and risk and return -- on a risk and return basis. And we continue to like all our products, whether we are on an incurred basis or under this new regime CECL, so no change in the thinking there. Now in terms of disclosure, what we've said previously, we continue to be in the same spot that we will provide disclosures that will create transparency between CECL incurred for the next four quarters.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just real quick, if I can go back to just the OpEx. I guess, clearly it's the topic on this call, but maybe we could get -- if you could give us a little bit of more color on just kinds of investments you're making and just maybe, just help us understand. Your loan growth next year is 5.5 to 7 is a little, I guess, in the range similar to this year, and it sounds like that some of these investments have a little bit longer payback period, but if it also supporting that 5 to 7 loan growth this year. And do you need to make those investments to achieve that growth, I guess on that\u2026","John Greene","So here's how we think about it. So there is the investment in brands to drive awareness and considerations. We haven't actually baked it in but we think that over time will lower our acquisition cost, our per unit acquisition cost as people find greater awareness of Discover, the product offerings, the customer experience and frankly, a fair value exchange, so that is one aspect but that is overtime and to be determined.","The other piece around technology investments, we're going to be very judicious about those and with those to make sure that we are deploying functionality that help make a difference to either our growth trajectory or expense profile. So overtime, I would expect that indeed we'll see efficiency gains, either top line or through the expense base. And some of them, as Roger said, longer term some are shorter term, but there's a thorough process to make sure we're getting the banks the buck.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","When we think about the sort of normal factors that cause hardship, loss of job, death, unemployment or illness and divorce. Is there anything that idiosyncratic that you're seeing that's changing in the portfolio, or is there a policy shift that's driving this?","John Greene","No, there's no change in terms of, I'll say customer behaviour. What you're seeing here is frankly, the benefit of frankly some from solid analytics by our collections team in terms of when a customer is experiencing difficulty and helping that customer managed through it. The only process change we've made is it used to be someone has to call in and talk to a rep. For large balances, that continues to be the case. For certain customers who meet certain criterias, they can do it online on their mobile app. And we've tested those populations versus the call in populations and actually the mobile app populations are performing as well or better than when someone talks to a rep.","So what you're really seeing here in the growth is a couple of factors; one is that I think there's a difference in reporting versus some competitors; two is, we have done an analytical exercise to make sure we understand paybacks and where to make a difference to cash flows positively and we've will opened those up. So it's a combination of those factors. And we're going to keep doing it as long as they're cash flow positive.","Rick Shane","And to the extent if you construct it from an NPV perspective, does the transition to CECL and for lifetime reserve make it easier, because there is less accounting sort of penalty to doing this?","John Greene","In terms of the P&L impact right when you take a TDR, you basically take the net present value of the cash flows and compare it to your balance, and that's the P&L impact. CECL, you basically do the same thing on life of loan losses. So yes, the relative kind of detriment to the P&L if you are growing TDRs is smaller under CECL. But you know that's not how we make decisions here.","Operator","We will take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","John, couple of follow ups on the day-two or conceptual accounting, can you clarify what you mean by the 75% not on day-one but on day-two. Are you talking about incremental division on just the loan growth? And then also can you talk once your allowance rate sort of is set, will it remain relatively stable through the year if there's no change in sort of mix or economic outlook?","John Greene","So in terms of 75% on day-two, it would be relative to what they would on incurred basis. So an incremental 75% versus incurred. Now loan growth will create incrementality versus an incurred basis, just the nature of taking a lifetime loss upfront in a provisioning standpoint.","And the team did a really good job in terms of modeling. And you know we feel like we're appropriately reserved. And from a day-one standpoint and going forward, if we're seeing better recoveries through a cycle or are better performance from a overall portfolio standpoint, then we'll adjust. And correspondingly, if we're challenged somewhere we will adjust the other way.","Don Fandetti","But conceptually, what do you think about sort of the reasons all else equal that the allowance rate remain relatively stable throughout year despite mix or economic change and we talking about sort of CECL being an incremental couple percent GAAP EPS impact, all else equal?","John Greene","So I'm not sure I\u2019m totally clear on the question. But I will try to answer and if I miss, we can come back. So in terms of -- if we're seeing a change in the economy or outlook of the economy, or a change in the performance of our portfolio, or a change in mix, all those will have an impact on the CECL reserves.","Don Fandetti","No I get that, but I\u2019m saying if those were not to change with the allowance rate, all else equal, kind of stay the same throughout the year.","John Greene","So it would build for loan growth at that rate. But in terms of relative difference to incurred, it'd be fairly consistent.","Operator","We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","So Roger, just wanted to swing back to the investment spend. I think during some of the comments, you were mentioning that with the investment spend, you are expecting to be able to enhance the brand awareness, if you use of words in particular or especially in non-card product. I'm wondering if your messaging does that you think that you're under-representing either the personal loans or in the student loans, or if there is products that you're looking to get into? Maybe you could touch base on what implications for that is. And if the payback for the investment should come in the form more in loan growth and NII, or should there be any fees associated with it as well? I just like to understand how to think about that.","Roger Hochschild","So the investment in brand there two parts, right. Part of it is just increasing considering on the card side. You've some more ground building awareness that we offer products other than just cash back, so we put add money behind miles as well. But we do, as we look at consumers out there, there is a gap in terms of both top of tunnel, people who consider Discover and have us top of mind. So that\u2019s why as we think about our marketing mix, we're going to heavy up a bit on top of funnel brand type advertising.","There also is an opportunity for our non-core products, in particular some of the deposit products. We've made great strides in terms of the product themselves, went out with no fees across any of our deposit products. But there still are huge amounts of consumers that don't understand, for example, we've even in the student loan business, let alone we are the second largest originator of private students loans and the same holds true with understand that Discover offers the savings account and checking account. So it\u2019s a mix of both of those. Building and enhancing consideration on the card side and building awareness for our non-card products.","Betsy Graseck","And then this investment spend should kick off in 1Q, like if I take this $100 million and just divide by four and throw that through the model linearly, or is this going to be back end loaded in a 4Q environment. How should I think about the pace of that spend throughout the year?","Roger Hochschild","We tend not to comment on the seasonality of the spend.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Roger and John, I had a high level of question on the guidance for you. I think everyone would agree with your earlier point that you guys have a rich history of generating high returns and industry leading operating efficiency. But within that, there's also been a commitment to positive operating leverage that we're not seeing in this year's guidance with your revenue growth and expense guidance suggesting that you're explicitly guiding to negative operating leverage. And so when we think about what's changed, it seems like in the past what we've seen from Discover is a commitment to managing expenses for the revenue environment and achieving positive operating leverage by finding cost improvement opportunities in one area, to the extent that you need to make investments in another, as opposed to the approach that you guys seem to be taking now, which is more along the lines of making the investments upfront with the expectation that you'll get the efficiency improvements later. So is that an accurate way of thinking about? I was just hoping you could comment on that and to share any high level thoughts, and that's my only question. Thanks.","Roger Hochschild","So first I'd say it's -- John is new, but you've got the same team that's been here for decades, making the investment. And I think you've seen a lot of discipline from us over the years, whether it's on the credit side or the expense side. It isn't necessarily a trade off where we sort of manage to an expense budget and then sort of if we can generate more efficiencies and that frees up more money for growth, we try and be disciplined and consistent.","So our investments in growth are really more driven by the opportunities we see to put our shareholders' money to work to drive good organic growth, with strong return profiles for that. And I mentioned that we expect our unit costs on the investments and the acquisition to be coming down next year. But we do feel like there's an opportunity to put some money to work with a bit of a longer payback on the brand side, in particular sort of top of funnel brand advertising dropping that awareness and consideration and on technology, that reflect some specific decisions we're making for 2020, I would not read into it any change in discipline, or philosophy from the team here at Discover.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","I guess kind of follow up on, just on the revenue growth, the loan growth and revenue growth. Is there the potential through some of the deposit products, are they consumer banking products, the growth of AREVA pay B2B that you could get revenue growth higher than loan growth over time. Is that a goal and is there a potential to do that? And it seems you've made a lot of investments in the network and in B2B payments over the last several years?","Roger Hochschild","Yes, B2B payments have benefited probably so far more in terms of volume than profitability. The margins can be very thin, but we've been clear that we would love to see more of our earnings come from the payments segments, and are very focused on driving that. That can be a multiyear initiative. So I wouldn't necessarily expect something transformational in 2020, but we have a unique collection of payments assets. If you look at PULSE, Diners Club and sort of the fact that we built the third largest global network in terms of acceptance, so the team is very focused on monetizing that. But again, you're talking about a B2B sales cycle and so that will take some time.","Bob Napoli","Maybe a follow-up on the competitive environment, and with the entrance of the Apple Card, which mean maybe is going, there have to be your demographic, the growth of [neobanks] probably going after the deposit space. In your target segments, several of them -- some of those companies getting super high valuations as private companies. What are your thoughts on the Apple Card, on the [neobanks], and some of your investment in brand in response to the competitive environment?","Roger Hochschild","So our investments in brand are much more driven by our traditional competitors. And as we're seen those super-high private company valuations appear to come and go. As I think about competition, competition in the card space is always intense. It tends to be rational but you have some large sophisticated players, it's a high-return business. It's challenging but always intensively competitive. So I would view that Apple Card as you can't underestimate anything that Apple does. It's is a new competitor and one I told before formidable, but I don't think it's transforming the overall competitive environment in the cards space.","On the deposit side, it's a different decision in terms of who you take a loan from, from who you give your money. And so brand and trust remain key elements of that. I think as you saw from the very strong direct-to-consumer deposit growth we posted, we feel like we have the product set and ability to compete, we really just need to build awareness. And a lot of the focus is on moving deposits from some of the traditional branch based players as opposed to us really going head-to-head with some of these emerging online players.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Hecht from Jefferies.","John Hecht","Actually most my questions have been asked but a couple of follow ups there. Number one is that you mentioned some unfavorable funding triggers in the quarter and I'm wondering are you able to unwind or are those kind of permanent aspects of the funding going forward?","John Greene","So actually what that was is if you go back about a year-and-a-half ago, we had some really cheap CDs on the books, and then there was Fed rate actions and more expensive deposits came on the books. And over time if there is no Fed action, you will see favorability come through into the P&L on that. And if you look at...","John Hecht","And what duration should we expect that and where you'll get that favorable outcome on the deposit costs?","John Greene","So, it's throughout this year and into next year.","John Hecht","And then follow up question would be, you've taken deposit as a percentage of funding up a couple of hundred basis points in 2019 period. How should we think about funding mix over the course of 2020?","John Hecht","So we enjoyed great growth there, I think it's testament to both the team and the products and Discover, in general. We have a longer-term target of 70% direct to consumer deposits thereabouts, and I would say next three to five years on that. So one way to do it would be to draw a line and plot it accordingly.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Scharf with JMP.","David Scharf","Once again pretty much all my questions have been answered except that I do want to just follow up when I hope is not a repetitive topic. On the investment spend, it seemed like collections was highlighted a couple of times, and I think backward looking in the fourth quarter, I have written down that you had more third-party professional fees. And then going forward, it was more of a broader investment late cycle. Just curious, I mean should we be thinking about sort of under capacity with in-house collectors. Is that why you defaulted to more third parties, or are you finding any challenges with recovery rates internally? Can you give us a little color besides just the cyclical factors?","Roger Hochschild","Ss just to be clear, in terms of collections which we define as prior charge off, 100% of that in house. And so that\u2019s with our own US-based employee, it is very scalable. A lot of our investments have been in the area of analytics, as well as if you think about collections is marketing. We have seen great impact from building out digital collections. There are a lot of people who may not want to talk about the situation therein, but like seeing an office they have online.","And so I think collections is an area where you can achieve competitive advantage. So it's been something that -- there hasn't been a change in our investment strategy there, it's been a multiyear journey and we expect to continue. On the recovery side, we do work with third parties. And so to the extent recoveries are more successful, because of the commission structures we will pay more in recovery fees but that usually means there is a net benefit.","John Greene","And just adding onto that. So the recoveries are up year-over-year about 28%. So what you're seeing is that that's I think a factor of portfolio but probably more reflective of where we are in the economic cycle and the fact that the consumer strength is probably quite frankly increasing and as wealth distribution is also improving mildly. So not a bad story there on the professional fees whatsoever.","Roger Hochschild","And just one thing I will point out, on the recovery side, we do not sell any of our charge-off paper, and haven't for well over 10 years. So you know you do enjoy a stream from those recoveries as opposed to people who would just sell and take the NPV.","David Scharf","And as far as -- just a quick follow-up, I assume embedded in your net charge-off range you provided for 2020 is a consistent recovery rate as a percentage of gross charge off rate is there any modification or conservatism built out? ","John Greene","So overall charge-offs, I mean we gave the range that's a net , and I think we're pretty comfortable with that as guidance.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank.","Meng Jiao","I just have one quick question, I guess on the deposits. It looks like I guess the brokered deposits were pretty down here. Is that the -- I guess the runway going forward is that we should see more, I guess, run off in the broker deposits range, as well as continued expansion in the direct to consumer?","Roger Hochschild","In general, that's the plan. We're going to keep that open as the channel. But in terms of our funding stack, that should continue to decrease as an overall percentage of the funding stack as the DTC increases.","Meng Jiao","And then I guess the second question is in terms of M&A, I know you guys are focused on B2B partnerships and noting that less interest in a bank deal. Has that changed materially from -- in prior quarters, or is that still the same message going forward?","Roger Hochschild","I think we feel good about the businesses we're in and our ability to grow that organically. And I think if you look on the banking side, I don't see any gaps in our model that we would need to fill.","Operator","We'll take our next question is from Bill Ryan with Compass Point.","Bill Ryan","Question on student lending, if you could maybe give us some idea of what your origination volume was in 2019 versus 2018 dollars and\/or percent and maybe what your outlook is for 2020? And maybe a little bit of color what you're seeing in terms of pricing your market share and borrower profile.","John Greene","So in terms of growth, we said organically we had 9% organic growth in student loans, not on originations but loan balance and we provided overall guidance on loan growth, which is inclusive of student loans. So we're not going to get into kind of origination levels, we just don't think that's probably the most helpful information.","Bill Ryan","And any color on pricing or where do you think your market share is and things like that?","Roger Hochschild","I think we feel good about the season of originations we've had. So again, they're a little harder to get market share data, but we certainly thought we held our position as the second largest originator, even in an environment where there were some new entrants. And in terms of kind of who we target and credit, we remain very disciplined.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer.","Dominick Gabriele","When you talk about the investment spend, how much of the investment spend, or are other plans to use this period of time to significantly invest in the global network in particular? And how much is the focus there given what you've talked about on investment spend? Thanks.","Roger Hochschild","Yes, I think we highlighted the two areas where we want to call out a significant increase. One was around the brand and advertising, the one the other one was on technology. We did not highlight a significant change in spending. And again, as we look at building our global acceptance, some of it is working with acquirers, some of those are very cost-effective. We built through the network-to-network agreements and that will remain a core part of the strategy.","Operator","And there are no further questions. At this time, Mr. Streem, your closing remarks please.","Craig Streem","Thanks, Erika. Thank you everybody for your attention and for staying with us through this long call. But we wanted to make sure that we took care of everybody's questions and didn't cut anybody off. But if you have any follow-ups, please come back to me and we will take care of it. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Throughout those 10 years, we've made great progress towards realizing our vision to be the leading direct bank and payments partner. This vision guides the choices we make and the strategies we employ to achieve our ultimate goal of creating long-term shareholder value.","I mentioned some of our key focus areas and strategies for 2017 on our Q4 earnings call, and you can see them outlined on page 3 of our earnings presentation. We've organized our strategies around two key focus areas, achieving a strong rate of profitable, disciplined asset growth in the near-term, while investing in capabilities that will create a firm foundation for future growth. Growth is an underlying theme in both of these focus areas because profitable, sustainable asset growth is essential to create long-term shareholder value in our lend-centric business model.","We have recently returned to faster growth because we deliberately slowed loan growth for much of 2015 and part of 2016, when for instance we curtailed our use of aggregator sites as the cost to acquire new card accounts in that channel grow significantly. In response, we developed and implemented several initiatives to return to the higher and more profitable asset growth you see today. These initiatives have spurred new account originations that are responsible for most of our recent credit card receivables growth.","I would also note that we have established a long-term track record of managing our credit risk in a disciplined fashion. With our focus on consumer lending, asset quality has a large and direct impact on our bottom line. That's one reason why prudent risk management underlies all we do. In managing credit risk, we stay keenly attuned to changes in the credit cycle. While credit fundamentals remain favorable and the lending market has been expanding, we have been making more loans. We continue to focus on attracting prime borrowers and achieving strong risk-adjusted returns.","With that context, let's examine our recent progress in achieving the strategic objectives in these two key focus areas. As cited in the highlights on page 4, we made substantial progress in the first quarter.","In the focus area of profitable, disciplined growth, we produced strong loan growth momentum across all of our primary lending products. We achieved this asset growth without sacrificing revenue growth. As I noted earlier, we reported a 20% ROE, while growing revenue 5% from a year ago. We demonstrated growth in our payments business as well. Of note, PULSE volume returned to year-over-year growth in the first quarter and is well-positioned for further gains during the rest of 2017.","We also delivered on our second focus area by investing wisely for the future. For instance, we continued to invest in our Cashback Match program, which is approaching its second anniversary. This program has proven a worthy investment by generating sustained customer engagement beyond the promotion period. Customers acquired through this program recognize the benefits enjoyed by all Discover it cardholders including an award-winning, all domestic customer service, innovative security features, pre-FICO scores, no annual fee and a competitive rewards structure.","We also remained productively engaged with our deposit customers, many of whom have another Discover relationship as well. We achieved strong annual balance growth while holding deposit rates steady. Finally, to see future growth, we continue to enhance our operating capabilities and manage our risks prudently. Enhanced operating capabilities support features and benefits that serve our customers better, which in turn fosters growth through customer loyalty. I'm particularly pleased that the Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Engagement Index ranks Discover card first in our industry for the 21st consecutive year, a feat unmatched by any of the 740 brands measured in their respective categories.","With respect to risk management, we remain good stewards of our shareholder capital and submitted our most recent CCAR capital plan to our regulators on April 5. Given our strong earnings and capital position, we expect to remain among the industry leaders in total payout ratio and shareholder yield.","In summary, I'm pleased with the achievements to date in our 2017 focus areas and our profitable and disciplined approach to generate long-term value for our shareholders.","I'll now ask Mark to discuss our first quarter results in more detail.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 5. For the first three months of 2017, we reported net income of $564 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.43, up 6% from the prior year. David noted that we remain focused on profitable, disciplined growth and you can see evidence of that in the 20% return on equity we generated for the quarter.","Turning to slide 6, total loans increased 8% over the prior year, driven by 7% growth in credit card receivables which represented nearly 80% of total loans. The increase in card receivables was primarily driven by growth in standard merchandise revolving balances.","Loan growth remained favorable across our other primary lending products as well. Personal loans increased 20% from the prior year as we attracted strong customer engagement with our simplified application experience and check-your-rate feature. Student loan balances rose 3% in total, but our organic book increased 12% year-over-year. We continue to make investments in early-stage product awareness and marketing to promote student loan growth.","Moving to the results from our payments network, Proprietary volume rose 4% year-over-year, driven by 6% higher credit card sales volume. Increased card usage and higher gas prices both contributed to this growth. In our Payment Services segment, as David already noted, PULSE volume returned to year-over-year growth during the first quarter with an increase of 4%. Diners Club volume rose 10% from the prior year on growth across all regions. And finally, Network Partners volume increased 2% from net-to-net and B2B payments activities.","Turning to slide 7, net interest income increased $142 million or 8% from a year ago, driven by a combination of strong loan growth and a higher net interest margin. On a sequential basis, our net interest margin was flat. I'll explain this more thoroughly in a subsequent slide.","Total noninterest income decreased $27 million or 6% year-over-year. The primary driver was a 15% decline in net discount and interchange revenue as rewards cost increased 24% from a year ago. Our rewards rate rose 19 basis points from the prior year, but declined 1 basis point sequentially. Promotional rewards accounted for nearly all of the higher rewards rate, with higher spending in our 5% categories driving most of the increase. At 1.25%, our rewards rate remains roughly in line with our 2017 guidance of 1.26% to 1.28%. Loan fee income grew $9 million or 11% year-over-year. Late fees accounted for most of the gain.","Moving now to slide 8, our net interest margin rose 13 basis points from the prior year, but held stable from the prior quarter at 10.07%. Relative to the first quarter of 2016, a higher prime rate and higher shares of standard merchandise balance and revolving loans contributed favorably to margin, although the pace of growth in the revolve rate slowed from the prior year. These gains were offset in part by higher charge-offs and a more costly funding mix.","Shifting gears and looking at a comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016, a higher prime rate added to margin, but was offset primarily by a combination of receivables mix, higher charge-offs of accrued interest, and modestly higher liquidity balances. Total loan yield increased 25 basis points from a year ago to 11.94%, driven by a 23-basis point increase in card yield. The increase in card yield was primarily the result of prime rate increases and a shift in portfolio mix.","On the liability side of the balance sheet, growth in our direct-to-consumer or DTC deposits remains one of our primary objectives. Average balances of these deposits increased $4.8 billion or 15% year-over-year. At $36 billion, DTC deposits now fund nearly half our total loans. We intend to continue to increase this share over time as DTC deposits provide relatively low cost and stable funding, and are also viewed favorably by debt investors and rating agencies. With deposit betas below historic norms, DTC deposit growth will also help mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on our funding costs, which increased 12 basis points from the prior year, driven by higher market rates and funding mix.","Turning to slide 9, operating expenses were flat relative to the prior year. Bear in mind, last year's results incorporated $30 million of expenses related to our BSA\/AML Look-Back Project. We spent less on professional fees which declined $13 million in aggregate from a year ago. Employee compensation and benefits rose 5% from last year, mostly because of higher staffing levels, driven in part by regulatory and compliance activities as well as higher average salaries.","Total marketing expenses rose a modest $6 million or 4% from a year ago. Increased acquisition and brand spending in card was largely offset by lower expenses in other areas. Marketing investments to support our card business as well as ongoing investments in rewards have been drivers of our strong loan growth. In summary, our expenses remain well managed. After declining 190 basis points from the prior year, our operating efficiency ratio for the quarter was just below 38% and remains one of the lowest in the industry.","I'll now discuss credit results on slide 10. Excluding acquired loans, total net charge-offs rose 48 basis points from the prior year and 30 basis points sequentially, in line with commentary we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call and in public forums during the quarter. Credit cards drove most of the increase as net charge-offs rose 50 basis points year-over-year and 37 basis points from the prior quarter. Student loan net charge-offs, excluding acquired loans, declined 2 basis points year-over-year and 59 basis points quarter-over-quarter, reflecting seasonal trends. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 71 basis points from the prior year and 46 basis points sequentially as credit performance continues to normalize from historically low levels. Relative to the prior quarter, 30-day delinquency rates were relatively stable or declined across all of our primary lending products.","We increased provision for loan losses by $162 million compared to the prior year, including a $97 million reserve build. While we continue to see some normalization in the credit environment, the increase in our provision is primarily the result of the seasoning of loan growth, which has been driven both by new accounts and to a lesser extent, growth initiatives directed at legacy accounts. On balance, the macroeconomic fundamentals underlying consumer credit performance remain favorable relative to historic norms. The labor market remains strong, home prices continue to rise, bankruptcy filings remain relatively low, and while rising, consumer financial obligations remain low relative to disposable income.","While charge-off rates have risen, they remain quite low by historical standards and within the context of our 2017 guidance. Loan growth, both in recent vintages and to some degree in the well-seasoned portion of the portfolio, continues to be the primary driver of reserve additions with the remainder being driven by ongoing normalization.","Once again, these trends are in line with our expectations. As David noted, we will remain disciplined and vigilant in managing our credit risk as we take advantage of current loan growth opportunities.","On slide 11, you'll note that we continue to deploy excess capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 20 basis points sequentially, driven by the seasonal decline in risk-weighted assets. However, over the past year, it declined by 90 basis points, reflecting the impact of our strong loan growth and more than $2.4 billion of capital returned to our shareholders.","As depicted in the chart, our trailing 12-month payout ratio exceeded 100% in the quarter. David previously mentioned that we submitted our CCAR capital plan on April 5, and I would note that we will continue to deploy shareholders' capital in a prudent manner that is consistent with our priorities: organic growth, dividends and share repurchases, asset acquisitions and M&A, in that order.","To sum it all up on slide 12, we're very pleased with our operating results, anchored by revenue growth of 5%, a double-digit margin and healthy 20% ROE. In addition, expenses remain well managed as evidenced by a 38% efficiency ratio. Our balance sheet remains strong as total loans expanded 8% with significant contributions from all three of our primary lending products. We continue to fund these loans with an increasing share of consumer deposits while realizing the benefits of relatively low betas.","Credit fundamentals remain favorable relative to historic standards with provisions primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth. And finally, we continue to benefit from a strong capital position that enables us to simultaneously invest in profitable asset growth while delivering a high payout ratio and total yield to our shareholders.","That concludes today's formal remarks. So, now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Chantelle, to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good evening. Appreciate the comments on the NIM, but I was just trying to get a little more clarity. Mark, you've talked about historically at least seeing some benefit from rate rises. As we look towards future rate rises and one that happened later in the quarter, should we assume that that will benefit the aggregate NIM?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes. So, I think there were a couple of things that saw the aggregate NIM not get a benefit this most recent quarter, Sanjay, and maybe that's a good starting place that'll let me talk to the quarter ahead as well a little bit.","So, if you talk about just the benefit of the moving rate, we saw about 15 basis points of goodness to NIM. The takeaways from that really were about a 5-basis point negative based on asset mix, promotional balances, transactors reengaging in the portfolio, and we also had a higher percentage of student loans that drive great risk-adjusted returns, but they don't have the highest yields associated with them. So, in combination, that took about 5 basis points away.","Another 5 basis points came off due to the increased charge-offs of accrued interest. Then you saw about 3 basis points come off based purely on funding volume. We did overfund a little bit for the quarter. We were pre-funding for a potential portfolio acquisition we were looking at, that didn't come to fruition. So, we're lugging around a little bit of extra 10-year money that we'll grow into here. That was a piece of it.","And then there was about 2 basis points as well that was really just netting of a whole bunch of positives and negatives. So on balance, that's kind of how you ended up flat on a fourth quarter to first quarter basis. We'll still have some of the impact of that overfunding as we head into the second quarter a little bit, but on balance I feel really good about our margin guidance of slightly higher on a full year basis. And we do indeed remain positioned to be asset sensitive.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Mark, can you clarify what your card charge-off guidance is for 2017? I think you've been thinking 30 basis points to 35 basis points, and I could be wrong, but it looked like Q1 might have trended a little higher than what you were thinking and just can you talk a little bit about that?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes. I think what we've said is \u2013 we didn't clarify card. We gave total charge-off guidance, said it was on the order of 35 basis points year-over-year, something like that. And I think it's really being driven by two different things, Don. It's being driven both by a growth component and I'll call it a normalization component. The growth piece of the puzzle I would say every year since the crisis, we've had advantage of new accounts that's been larger than the one that preceded it and as you know well, new accounts season at loss rates they're above portfolio loss rates and that's part of the phenomena. We also have engaged in some growth stimulating activities over the last couple of years in the legacy back book. We have some seasoning of some new line availability there as well.","And then the normalization piece of the puzzle that I would say is really more just eight years or nine years post the crisis. Folks have had the ability to encounter life events or get over leverage or whatever the case might be. So, as we've been saying, card books don't operate with low 2% charge-off handles on a normalized basis. I think we're just seeing some degree of that normal normalization creep into the book, but it doesn't feel like a cyclical turn. All the macro factors continue to feel really strong and that normalization relatively modest.","In terms of the first quarter move there, I would say \u2013 I think it was pretty well in line with the guidance that we gave on our fourth quarter call. We said that it was going to look more and the first quarter would be lumpy and that we expected the increase in charge-offs to look a little bit more like the increase from third quarter into fourth quarter than what we were guiding for, for the full year. So as I sit here right now, I don't see any reason to revise the thoughts we provided around the charge-offs on a full year basis. That 35 or so basis points directionally is correct. It could be a smidge higher or a whisker lower, but in that general ballpark is the way to think about it.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And just to clarify, the potential portfolio acquisition, can you talk about which product that was in? Was it personal loans, cards and is that a source of potential loan growth going forward?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No. I'd prefer to stay silent on that one, Don. I guess the one thing I would say is given we funded it with 10-year money, it probably wasn't cards, but I'll leave it at that.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask one thing related to the net charge-offs. As we look at the data and look at your roll rates in card from 90-day delinquencies into net charge-offs, seems like that roll rate is increasing. And then when we look at the data from your securitization which I know is a well-seasoned piece of business, but it looks like recoveries are coming down a bit. We've talked in the past before about this, Mark, but we finally worked through some of the recoveries related to the financial crisis, but are we not yet picking up recoveries from some of your recent loan growth?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes. So I would say on the latter point, most of the charge-offs that were generated during the crisis have now passed the statute of limitations. So while we don't stop trying to collect at that point in time, the collection percentage does indeed decline. So I think, Chris, yes, you definitely are seeing and candidly that was the gift that kept on giving for an awful lot longer than it normally does, and to normally post a peak in charge-offs, you really have strong recoveries for 24 months to 36 months. This time we got them for bloody well close seven years. So, it was definitely the gift that kept on giving.","As far as the rolls are concerned, what I'd really point you to is if you look at the trends and delinquencies in the earlier stage buckets, all continue to be really favorable. And that's really more I think the indicator of what's coming at you to be looking at and thinking about in terms of how we came up with our thoughts on our guidance on a full year basis. But in terms of just general loss development, it feels again, as I said earlier, like our earlier guidance from the last quarter's call. For the full year, it still feels like it's in the relevant range.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then just kind of curious \u2013 just a question on marketing, when I look back a year ago, you had a pretty low number and there was some talk about the timing of it. I don't think $168 million should be a run rate for marketing but, I mean, we should expect typical seasonal increases in that number, right? It's not that you're not taking the foot off the accelerator on marketing, are you?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","No. I would say that we were growing a bit faster as you can see. We're very pleased with the results of the marketing dollars and I would guide you to look at the rewards line and we do kind of think about, especially when we're thinking about promotional amounts, about where we get the best investments in marketing dollars directly, or in Cashback Bonus which attracts more customers more cost-effectively. And you can see there, we have increased our investment, and we do expect to spend more in marketing this year than we did last year.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Got it. Thanks very much, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good evening, guys. Mark, maybe I can start off with expenses, so obviously they came in a lot lower than I think the Street had been looking for. David just referred to marketing expenses will obviously be up from this quarter and year-over-year. But do you still feel the $3.8 billion of expenses is the right number in terms of what you'll spend for 2017?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes, I mean, I guess, Ryan, as I sit here right now, still feel good about the $3.8 billion. We definitely have leverage over that number, and if we see other things working against us that we feel a need to pull at, we can pull at those. And we've said all along, you've heard my three-engine aircraft analogy or the market's heard my three-engine aircraft analogy many times, and we can pull back on those throttles accordingly.","There is a lag between spend and results, right? So, a lot of the growth you're seeing this quarter, yes, a lot of it's rewards, but a lot of it is also marketing dollars that were invested last year, that really kind of produced the loan growth you see on, on to this quarter. So I think there will be some seasonally adjusted marketing spend as we go through the year, but we will be very mindful on that expense line.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And maybe if I could ask one for David, many of us just got off another call where the outlook for loan growth is lower amid increasing consumer indebtedness, higher competition. So maybe just in both card and personal, can you just talk about the decision to accelerate growth where you're actually seeing good opportunities for growth, and do you think that you could actually sustain these type of growth rates in both card and personal?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Yes, well, if I start with card, we were growing two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, when the market was actually shrinking. And to some degree, it's a whole lot easier to grow when the market's growing than when it's purely share gain because the market is shrinking. So in some ways, the environment is better. Now it is clearly more competitive and you're seeing us, particularly in the rewards space, invest more in rewards in order to remain competitive, and that's paying off in these results.","I did mention to you that in my prepared remarks, that a year ago we were pulling back from some areas where we weren't as comfortable with the returns, specifically some of the aggregator sites that had become very popular with some of our competitors, and that cost us a bit of growth last year, it gives us a little bit better comp for this year's growth, so that's also a piece of it.","But, generally, we see great opportunities in the prime credit card market, and I'm not sure, the fact that we're not a subprime player, in my observation, is that market has gone through a lot more gyrations, and so people that are exposed to that may have bigger swings than we have. But in the prime space, we're pleased with the opportunities.","More broadly, in the other products, you can see personal loans continues to grow very nicely, and when there's more loans outstanding, there's more loans to consolidate, and that is heavily a consolidation product, and so we're seeing strong opportunities there. I would expect that as variable interest, variable priced interest rate credit cards reprice upwards, that opportunity may continue as we consolidate in. And of course, tuition continues to increase in schools, and so we continue to find good opportunities to grow in our private student loan program. So I would say, all in all, while it's more competitive than it was, there's more opportunities than there were.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","And I would just pile on to that quickly with just one little comment, and David noted that we did pull back on growth last year or the year before, when we saw that we weren't meeting our return thresholds. We wouldn't hesitate to do that again, just to be clear. I mean, right now we are getting good solid growth. If anything, we've tightened credit recently, and we're still getting this really good solid growth. I think that's a key point, and I would also point out that as long as that's the case and we can make rational assumptions and drive good credit, loan growth is the key to compounding shareholder value in that lend-centric business model. So we really feel good about the growth we're putting up right now.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, both, for the in-depth answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, thanks very much. Mark, just on the rewards cost, typically there's a decent amount of seasonality in that, and yet this first quarter comes in more or less in line with the full year guidance. So is this a change in the marketplace? Or is there something else occurring relative to the historical pattern?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No. I think a big piece of it, Eric, really is the cadence on the rewards stuff, unlike a lot of the seasonality in the industry, is really under our control, right? So we can choose what programs we want to run for the 5% program in any given quarter. It's really the management set rate for lack of a better term as opposed to cyclical or seasonal factors that affect it. So really it was a conscious decision more than anything else.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So does that suggest that at this moment your outlook is for more or less a sustained level of rewards expense?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes. I would speak specifically because there will be peaks and valleys. So I'd speak specifically to the full year guidance of 1.26% to 1.28%. Still feel good about that guidance as we sit here right now.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Afternoon. Thanks very much. Mark, you talked about how the rewards expense payout was consistent with guidance, but looking at historical patterns, it looks like your rewards in Q1 is seasonally a little lower than the other quarters, so I'm wondering is the seasonality changing? Or are we just keeping our eyes open to what might come of the rewards expense ratio?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No. Again, I would say it's really a management set rate. It's not really a seasonal rate, historically. Like last year, sometimes gas is in there, sometimes gas isn't. So I feel good about the full year guidance of 1.26% to 1.28%, and the first quarter was really again just conscious decisioning.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then all else equal on credit, with an even economic backdrop, unemployment and wage expansion and borrowing the rates where we are, would you think that 2017 represents kind of the normalization year? Or would you expect loss rates to accumulate into 2018 before they flatten out?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","It's David. I think that we're likely to see them continue to rise a bit, at least into 2018. I don't see anything dramatic as long as \u2013 as you point out, the economic environment is actually quite good. So with 4.5% unemployment and rising house prices, I think the normalization you're talking about is the driver as opposed to the beginning of a new cycle, but at some point, unemployment will start to rise and then that will start to impact as well.","So we're really going to have to see another cycle before we know what the new normal is, and I would say for us below 3% charge-off rates continues to be well under our long-term business model. But I would also say that we think the long-term new normal is way below what it historically was before all the structural changes that happened with CARD Act and the consolidation and so on in the industry.","So maybe a little bit of a long answer, but we're not providing guidance yet. But I would expect 2018 to be somewhat higher than 2017 as I sit here today.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Couple of follow-ups. Just one on the, what keeps you up at night kind of question. It sounds like things are going really well and you are still investing in growth and just want to understand, is there anything out there that keeps you up at night and slows down the growth at all?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","No. I sleep very well. Thank you. But I would say over my career, I mean credit is probably the single most important thing that I think we have to be diligent on. And that has served us well and will continue to be the thing that we probably focus on the most. And I'd say secondly, being diligent on pricing, rewards, sustainable rewards structures. One thing about credit cards is that \u2013 I mean our average credit card customer's been with us for 12 years, and so you really lock in a long-term relationship when you approve someone. And so it's important to take the long-term and not to get carried away by short-term fluctuations in the market.","And we took a little criticism a year ago when we slowed down and others were starting to speed up, and I think it's paying off with us as we continue to grow our EPS and others are struggling to do so and as we continue to have a 20% ROE. So I would say focusing on the basics. I mean some people might point to technology changing or the competitive set changing. But I think people, when I observe what's gotten people into trouble over time, it's when they lose track of the basics of credit extension and pricing.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on balance transfers, did I hear you correctly in saying that, that impacted NIM in part this quarter?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Promotional activity broadly did impact NIM a little bit this quarter, Betsy. So it was about 5 basis points was due to mix, was a detractor from NIM, and that was really three main components. It was partially \u2013 we saw transactors reemerge in the book to a larger degree than we expected. We did see some higher promotional activity with our double Cashback Match as well as some BTs. And then student loans picked up a little bit as a percentage of the overall book, and they're simply lower yielding. You make up for it on a loss rate, but it does have a modest negative effect on them.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And the improvement that you saw in spend year-on-year, that's a function \u2013 I mean that's also an output. Is that correct?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes. The spend is really a function, I mean it was standard merch balances that drove the increase in spend. So it was regular way utilization of the card that we feel really good about.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. The efficiency ratio continues to be very good. As we look out over the next few years, is there still operating leverage left in this business? Can you drive that efficiency ratio lower over time? And if so, what's a reasonable way to think about that over the next few years?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Bob, I think our business model's kind of established at that 38% efficiency ratio target that we came in just below this quarter. And when you combine that with that other thought process that I shared earlier about the key to compounding shareholder value in a lend-centric business model is continuing to drive the right kind of quality loan growth over time. I'd be concerned about peeling back on muscle. And it's one thing to cut fat, start thinking about cutting muscle, you have other effects on the business. So we will always look for opportunities to be more efficient. We will always look for opportunities to find ways to protect the customer experience while doing more with less. But ultimately, I wouldn't propose to revise that 38% longer-term guidance that's there.","That being said, that's kind of a separate question in one respect from the expense leverage because obviously, if credit does turn meaningfully against you, you have some giant geopolitical event, whatever the case might be. You clearly do have expense leverage in the model that you could act and react accordingly and appropriately.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the payments businesses, you did have some acceleration this quarter, and I think you lapped, got easier comps as well. Any thoughts on the ability to try to accelerate that business further? I still think it's well below where you'd like to see it on a longer-term basis. I mean the Diners Club had some pretty impressive acceleration.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, we do think there's opportunity to accelerate it past this. I'm really pleased that we returned to growth after a couple of difficult years mainly from the loss of one business from one very large customer. We don't have that kind of concentration anymore. And PULSE had a long-term \u2013 for many years after we bought PULSE, it outgrew the industry and the last couple of years have been very difficult as we lost some share and so we're taking all the steps we can to try to regain share. It's very tough when we got to deal with some of the things that a few competitors are doing, which are really hard to compete against without that level playing field, but I'm pleased that we're at least \u2013 that we're growing and looking to accelerate from here.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. The tax rate for this year, is it \u2013 the 35% tax rate in the first quarter, is that what you'd expect for the full year or...","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No. We had a couple of settlements, some open tax matters in a few states in the quarter, Bob. I think sort of that 36% to 37% range is the right way to think about the full year.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Mark, I want to revisit \u2013 it's been asked a few different ways, but as you recounted the litany of puts and takes in NIM this quarter, you among other things mentioned transactors were reemerging in the book and a bigger part of the asset mix. And I'm trying to get a sense for whether or not \u2013 in your mind, as you plan your rewards rates, I mean, is that a leading indicator or any kind of red flag that perhaps the rewards spend may be getting a little too high? I mean is the transactor mix, was it very modest on the margin or is it a sign that tells us from an ROE basis there's actually room to potentially trim back rewards at the end of the year?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","It's David. I'll take that one. If you look at the \u2013 our sales grew 6% and our loans grew 7% this time. And so I think if you have that concern, you'd see sales growing a whole lot faster than loans because you're getting transactors that aren't turning into loans which some of our competitors have been chasing. So, I feel very pleased that our sales have gotten up very close to loans and that's been our target for a couple of years and we're hoping to maintain it and it doesn't \u2013 it more gives me a signal that our programs are working and we're moving to a nice balance as opposed to needing to change something from here.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And switching to the credit side, notwithstanding the commentary on normalization, I'm wondering within the personal loan category, was that sequential rise in losses from Q4 to Q1? Was that in line with your expectations? I mean, it was steeper obviously than all the other categories and it's steeper than anything that took place seasonally a year ago. Is there anything behind that?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","No. It actually was in line with our expectations. I think there's two pieces of the puzzle there. Piece number one is just simply the level of overall loan growth we generated over the period of time proceeding and leading up to that that really kind of goes through the peak seasoning and drives that, that's a piece of it, number one.","The second piece of it is we did run a small test of some potential to set up a marketplace business for lack of a better way of putting it. So, we did originate some stuff that was a little bit lower than we normally would've played. It was a very small portfolio test and control. And that had an impact of adding a few basis points to what that reported rate was as well. It wasn't directionally the driver by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a small piece of it also. So, all consistent with our expectations and in line with our guidance for the full year as well.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. And just real quickly as a cleanup, on the reserve rate, is the level we saw at the end of the Q1 a good way to think about for most of the \u2013 balance of the year?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes. We always set reserves on a forward-looking basis, so I'm going to have to \u2013 I bluntly couldn't even tell you what my reserve rate was. But I can tell you roughly where it was, but I couldn't tell you exactly because we can't manage to it. So we're setting on a forward-looking basis. What I would say is, I \u2013 there's going to be that element of normalization that's taking place out there. It remains modest, but really it's going to be growth that are going to be the primary drivers of the growth in reserve and the provision expense as I look forward. And we're not losing any sleep that we can't manage the credit situation we're confronted with right now.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks so much, guys.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. Mark, I know you've been pretty clear on the big drivers for the upswing in charge-offs around both growth and normalization. Is there an element to which it's also being driven by a bit of a loosening in the credit box and maybe moving down FICO a little bit in your new growth, relative to what you've done, or have you really held the line on FICO scores and loss content?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","I think we've pretty well held the line. I mean, if anything, of the last quarter or two quarters, we've tightened credit, in terms of directionally where we've gone, as opposed to liberalizing it. So, feel pretty good about that. If you go back a few years, we've talked to market in the past about, we will look to expand the credit box a little bit from time to time. And if you go back a few years, we did a little bit of it. I think that's all performing in line with our expectations and we're getting paid for it in the NIM as well. So feel very good about that and if you think about it as the sundae, it wasn't the ice cream or the hot fudge, maybe it was the whipped cream or the cherry, is the way to think about it on the growth levels. So it was just marginal.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then \u2013 sorry. One of your competitors in the student lending space reported slower growth, loan growth, for the quarter than they expect for the year, and they attributed that to kind of the disproportionate share of for-profit schools and the disbursement season for the spring. Are you seeing any kind of uptick in your share of for-profit schools and if so, any kind of thoughts on implications for losses going forward?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, it wouldn't be us because we don't underwrite for not-for-profit schools...","Unknown Speaker","For-profit.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","For-profit schools, I'm sorry. And the first quarter is not a big quarter for disbursement, so it's hard to get a read, but we're seeing that we had expected somewhat higher growth this year in that business, more originations this year than last year, and so far we're seeing that.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. It's been asked and answered, but I wanted to come back quickly just to the rewards side of things. And maybe if you could just, David or Mark, talk a little bit about how you might use that, whether it's the rotating category or some other aspect, to kind of drive, and, David, you said you're generally happy with the characteristics. But are there any other ways that you can think about, kind of optimizing your performance in the coming year?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, because we have quarterly categories, we're able to be somewhat strategic and see what else is going on in the industry, what performance we've had in the past. And so, as has been talked about several times this time, we purposely went out with somewhat richer categories, the 5% programs, in this first quarter of the year, based on some of the things that we saw going on in the market, and you see the sales results in particular, show that those have been well received. And so, I think the 5% program is the one that we can change the most.","I think then, the second thing is, the Double is continuing to work very well. We had originally put that in as a test, it worked, we've continued, and right now we have no plans to back off on that, and it's allowing us to get strong costs per account, strong engagement, and not be as wedded to some of the aggregator sites as some of our competitors are.","And then the third piece is we continue to work very hard on the redemption side and growing the number of partners who help fund and provide additional value to cardholders, leveraging our network in a way that's hard for our competitors to follow.","Now, it's not quite Cashback Bonus, but I'll just mention that we're really pleased that we're doing a program right now with Walmart that you've seen launch last week, I think. And we think programs like that is still rewards essentially, and it's cause marketing. And we don't have results yet, but we're optimistic that, that kind of engagement with our customers, with our retailer partners will pay dividends.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So, please, use your card at Walmart and provide a free meal.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just a quick follow-up. You mentioned, David, the 12-year kind of average tenure, but part of the Discover, it was to attract a somewhat younger demographic. And can you talk a little bit about how that's going and what your success there has been because that's been kind of a hot (51:23)?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Yes. I'd say it's working well, and all of our marketing results and brand tests show that we do particularly well with Millennials compared to almost any other card brand. And so I would say we have a double-edged strategy. One is to grow, especially with the Millennials, but grow through new accounts. But the second is to retain our existing customers through better service, through lower charge-offs and through a strong rewards program. And it's that combination of not having a leaky bucket and then filling the bucket with new customers with a differentiated product with Discover it, specifically, that is working for us.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey with Wedbush. Your line is open.","Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my call. This is probably overly simplistic, but when we look at the quarterly trends and quarterly charge-offs, do you think that there was a sort of \"a jump\" in the second half of last year which will make the quarter-over-quarter comparisons easier as we go into the second half of the year? And I know you talked about it in the past, but is it fair to think of the March quarter as a bigger reserve build relative to the rest of the year?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","I'll let Mark answer the reserve question. But on the seasonality, I guess the way I would look at it is first quarter of last year was a pretty low quarter of charge-offs.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","It's the low point for delinquencies, early stage delinquency. Yes.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And so that essentially is what you're describing and is what you would expect in order to reach the roughly 35 basis points increase for the full year. We obviously would not reach that if we have kept up the same year-over-year, so we would expect the year-over-year to moderate from here. Mark, on the reserve.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes. On the reserve, we don't give provision guidance, so I'll steer clear of that one, Henry. But what I would say is we did give the charge-off guidance, and I think I can use that to answer your question. And really we did see a bigger bump in first quarter charge-off growth than we're guiding for in basis point terms for the full year. So clearly, that low point of delinquencies in the first quarter of last year is entering into our thought process.","Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And then just kind of an unrelated question, but right now you have three core products that are driving the equation plus the direct bank. Have you thought about adding a fifth or sixth product to the quiver? Or is it really, you're going to focus right where you are?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, first I would certainly include the deposit products. I mean that's $37 billion of deposits from our customers, so I would look at it more like four. And even within deposit products, there's CDs, very different than money markets, checking, et cetera. But I would say home equity is the product that we are in. It's very small. It's a very big market relative to many other markets.","I think we're coming into a particularly good part of the cycle in which home equity will be in higher demand as people look to use home equity as opposed to refinancing their very low-rate first mortgage. We're in the early days of that. We're still fine-tuning our infrastructure, our modeling and so on. So, it's not particularly significant today, but it is an area that we would like to grow further to create a, what I would call, a fifth product.","Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Insight into where the student loan market is likely to go relative to the federal programs, or...","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","We're not counting on any change today. I would hope that any changes that come in future years might be positive. To me, it is an unusual market and that 95% is provided by the federal government and only about 5% or 6% by private. And so, if the government backs off any piece of that market, such as graduate loans as an example, it's a market that we would hope could accelerate, and we would take the position to take advantage of it. And we are in the final stages of converting our system.","We've talked about that in previous calls, and I think having a state-of-the-art proprietary system that's very scalable, I think could position us well for possible acceleration in future years. I don't know if that would be 2018 or 2019, but it's a great market, it's by far the lowest charge-off market for any kind of installment loan that I'm familiar with, and you saw that was the one product that actually improved this quarter and was the lowest charge-offs of any quarter that we've had in the last two years.","Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question, guys. Maybe just a quick one on the longer-term credit outlook. I think at the last Investor Day, you provided a longer-term charge-off ratios target of 3.5% to 4.5%. Is that still a reasonable range to think about as we look ahead over the next couple of years?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes, I think the most recent guidance we gave was back in January of last year and we said 3% to 4% is what we kind of expected normalize to be, so a little bit inside of that. I'd pick up on David's earlier comment, there's a bit of Kentucky windage in that estimate. None of us have been here in a post-CARD Act world before, with our books kind of having gone through the crisis. And all the cleansing that took place from that, coupled with the discipline that's kind of brought in by CARD Act. So we think that's a pretty good guesstimate of what new normal looks like through the cycle, but as David noted earlier, we're kind of going to need to ride through a cycle to validate that definitively.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for that, Mark. And then just a quick follow-up on the direct bank, looks like you guys have had some good success with your deposit-gathering efforts, while the deposit betas remain surprisingly low, at least thus far into the tightening cycle. Can you maybe share your expectations for what you're expecting for the remainder of the year?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yes, I think we'll probably start to step into normalized betas over the next several rate increases, I think it's kind of really a stair-step function. The money supply that's in the market has just got a tremendous amount of deposits in the system more broadly, and I think as the Fed begins to shrink its balance sheet, that'll have a bearing and an impact on that. I think to the extent loan growth continues across the industry, I think there will be demand for those deposits. So I think you'll start to see some betas kick in, but I do think it plays out over time. So as opposed to going from a beta of essentially zero to normalized assumed betas, I think over the next two, three, four, I'm not smart enough to tell you exactly how many moves you kind of stair-step your way there.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet.

My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2019 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Craig Streem","Thank you very much, Erica. And welcome everyone to this afternoon's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear on today's earnings press release and presentation.","Our call today will include formal remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, covering third quarter highlights; and then it's my pleasure to welcome John Greene, our new Chief Financial Officer, who will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. After John completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Hochschild","Thanks, Craig and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. As you can readily see from our results, we continue to deliver very sound fundamental performance this quarter, leading to net income of $770 million after tax or $2.36 per share with a robust return on equity of 26%. We achieved our key objectives for loan growth, net interest margin and credit performance, setting us up to finish the year on a very solid footing. But at the same time, the strength and profitability of our business allow us to make ongoing investments which could further enhance our competitive position in each of our products and enable us to achieve continued strong results.","Looking at the key drivers, total loans were up 6% and credit performance remains strong across all of our products, reflecting our disciplined and underwriting new accounts and line management as well as the clear benefits of our continued investments in servicing and collection capabilities.","Card receivables grew 7% this quarter, reflecting a healthy mix of volume from both new and existing customers and origination activity skewed more to higher yielding merchandise balances versus promotional balances. This demonstrates a positive degree of customer engagement while providing a favorable contribution to the overall net interest margin.","Turning to our student loan business, growth remains strong this quarter and originations were in line with our expectations through the peak season. We're seeing an improvement in conversions driven by increasing awareness of the Discover brand in the student loan market and better customer experience at the front end.","We're excited about our competitive position in private student lending and we remain confident in our ability to grow loans and gain market share despite competitive pressure. In personal loans, growth was in line with our expectations as we remain disciplined on originating loans that meet our return objectives. Credit performance continues to stabilize, reflecting the positive outcome from recent credit tightening and implementation of enhanced risk mitigation strategies.","Overall, underlying credit trends continue to be favorable across our lending products with credit performance driven more by growth in receivables as compared to normalization of the back book. The U.S. consumer and the overall economy continue to look good with unemployment at a 50-year low and consumer sentiment at a high level as we enter the holiday season.","This was also another quarter of strong growth in consumer deposits which past the $50 billion mark and are now over half of our total funding. We've been able to maintain deposit pricing in the middle of the pack and have been pleased with our ability to continue to attract cost-effective funding in a falling rate environment. We recently introduced our no fee commitment across our deposit products and while still early, we believe this has resonated with customers and is contributing to our deposit growth.","Pretax income for our Payment Services segment increased 16%, primarily driven by strong volume growth from our PULSE business. The PULSE team continues to expand business with existing issuers and win new relationships through creative debit solutions that deliver meaningful value for partners.","Additionally, we can see to make progress against our strategy to enhance global acceptance by investing in partnerships with local acquirers and adding network-to-network partners. This quarter, we added two acquirer partners in France, [indiscernible] and Ark\u00e9a as we continue to focus on acceptance in Western Europe. In addition, we're expanding acceptance in Africa with our partnership with Verve, a Nigeria based payments network that will provide acceptance in a number of African countries for Discover and our net-to-net partners such as RuPay and BC Card.","To summarize the quarter, our performance once again demonstrates the strength of the Discover business model. Our commitment to providing an industry-leading experience to our customers and our disciplined approach to profitable growth and credit management continue to provide strong returns and long-term value to our shareholders.","The economic environment remains favorable and we do not see that changing in the near-term. That said, it is likely that we are in the later stages of the economic cycle and we are continuing to manage origination, servicing and operational effectiveness with that very much in mind.","Before I wrap up my section of our formal remarks, I want to acknowledge Mark Graf\u2019s retirement from Discover. Mark has been a valued colleague and leader since he joined the company in 2011 and will remain at Discover as an Executive Advisor until his retirement in early 2020. We wish Mark and his family the very best for the future.","And now I want to take a moment to formally introduce our new CFO, John Greene. John brings significant experience in financial services including over eight years at HSBC where he held the role of CFO of their largest business unit retail banking and wealth management. And he also brings over 12 years of experience at GE. John held public company CFO roles at Willis Group Holdings where he was instrumental in a turnaround of the company and subsequent merger with Towers Watson and most recently John was CFO at the Biogen spin-off Bioverativ.","John is joining Discover at an important time and brings very relevant capabilities and experience. I'm very excited about the impact I expect John to have here at Discover. And I'm sure you'll enjoy working with him.","I'll now ask John to discuss our financial results in more detail.","John Greene","Thank you, Roger. Before I begin, I wanted to say that I'm very excited to be part of the Discover team. My first month confirmed my initial view that I was joining a great organization. I'm looking forward to an exciting future with Discover as well as the opportunity to work with all of you.","Now onto the business at hand. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on Slide 4. Looking at the key elements of the income statement, revenue growth of 6% this quarter was driven by loan growth of 6%, consistent with our expectation and a very solid 8% growth in net interest income. The 8% increase in provision for loan losses was mainly driven by the seasoning of newer vintages and to a lesser extent by the continued supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry.","Operating expenses were up 9% year-over-year due to higher compensation expense and investments in supportive growth and new capabilities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5%, reflecting $12 million benefit from the favorable resolution of a certain tax matters. Net income and EPS were up 7% and 15% respectively.","Turning to Slide 5, loans increased 6% over the prior year, led by 7% growth in credit card receivables. Standard merchandise balances continued to be the primary driver of card receivable growth. While the contribution from promotional balances was minimal, reflecting our decision to reduce the level of growth from promotional activities over the past several quarters, roughly 60% of the increase in loan balance was from new accounts and about 40% from existing.","Turning to student loans. Total loan balances were up 4% from the prior year. The organic piece of our student loan portfolio increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting our strong competitive position. Personal loan growth was in line with our expectations increasing 1% from the prior year, reflecting the previously mentioned slowdown in originations as we work through the development and testing of new underwriting models.","Moving to payments volume. To the right on Slide 5, you can see the proprietary volume was up 6% year-over-year. In Payment Services, PULSE volume increased 5% over the prior year, driven by incremental volume from existing issuers, new issuers on the PULSE network and growth in our PINless products such as PULSE PAY Express and PULSE E-commerce. AribaPay drove the 30% increase in Network Partners volume while Diners Club volume was flat to the prior year.","Moving to revenue on Slide 6, net interest income of $2.4 billion was up 8% from the prior year, driven by three factors. First, higher loan balances. Second, higher revolve rate this quarter and third, somewhat lower promotional balances in this year's quarter. Total noninterest income was $498 million in the quarter, down $3 million or 1% from last year's quarter. The principle drivers of the decline were lower net discounts and interchange revenue, partially offset by higher loan fee income.","Drilling down a bit, net discounts and interchange revenue was $255 million in the quarter, down 9% as revenue from higher sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs. This was primarily due to adding PayPal to the 5% rewards category. Sales volume was up 4% from the prior year were 5% when normalizing for processing days, offsetting the decrease in net discounts and interchange revenue was an increase of $17 million or 17% in loan fee income. The increase was principally due to an increase in late fee occurrences as well as an adjustment in late fee pricing tiers.","As shown on Slide 7, our net interest margin was 10.43%, up 15 basis points year-over-year and down four basis points sequentially. Relative to the third quarter of last year, the increase in NIM was due to a favorable promotional balance mix and higher revolve rate. These were partially offset by higher brokered and direct-to-consumer deposit costs and by higher interest charge-offs. Compared to the second quarter, NIM decreased principally due to the roll-off of lower coupon brokered and direct-to-consumer deposits, along with the impact of prime rate decreases in July and September.","Partially offsetting this was a favorable funding mix, a higher revolve rate and lower interest charge-offs. Total loan yield increased 31 basis points from a year ago to 12.76% driven by increases in yields for all of our principle loan products, 29 basis points in card, 35 basis points in private student loans and 51 basis points in personal loans.","Card yield benefited from the impact of the 2018 prime rate increases, favorability in the revolve rate and a lower level of promotional balances which were partially offset by higher interest charge-offs and the impact of recent prime rate decreases. The year-over-year increase in student loan yield was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates as about 60% of the portfolio is floating rate.","The increase in personal loan yield was also driven by the impact of prime rate increases in the prior year as well as positive pricing actions. We expect to see a degree of yield compression from recent cuts in the Fed funds rate, which won't entirely be offset by lower funding costs. We have taken action by steadily reducing our asset sensitivity and consider our interest rate risk position to be essentially neutral at this point.","Looking ahead, we expect to maintain this interest rate risk position for the foreseeable future. Our outlook anticipates one more 25 basis points rate reduction in 2019. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average consumer deposits grew 19% from last year and now make up 53% of total funding. Consumer deposit rates decreased four basis points from the prior quarter and 28 basis points above the prior year.","Importantly, we've been able to achieve strong deposit growth while maintaining a disciplined pricing strategy. Since the Fed began raising rates in 2015, we realized a 51% cumulative deposit price beta for online savings. Of course, the Fed has recently cut its target rate by 50 basis points and we've responded by lowering our deposit rates where they realize beta of 50% on our savings accounts over the last few months. We will continue to manage deposit costs prudently taking into account competitors' behavior.","Turning to Slide 8, total operating expenses rose $92 million from the prior year. Employee compensation increased $31 million, driven by staff additions in technology and other areas to support business growth as well as higher average salaries and benefits. Increased investments in new account acquisitions across our deposits, student lending and card products drove marketing cost up 6% from the prior year. The 8% increase in information processing reflects our continued investment in infrastructure and analytic capabilities. Professional fees were $23 million higher with a little over half of that due to increased collection costs related to higher recoveries in the quarter.","Now I'll discuss our credit results on Slide 9, total net charge-offs were up eight basis points from the prior year. The increase continues to be primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth and supply driven credit normalization. Credit card net charge-offs were 18 basis points higher year-over-year and down 17 basis points from the prior quarter. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 16 basis points sequentially. Credit performance and the card business continues to be very solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to credit management in both new and existing accounts.","Private student loan credit performance also remains strong with net charge-offs down 37 basis points year-over-year and two basis points sequentially aided by efficiency gains in collection, including enhanced communication and outreach to co-signers. Personal loan net charge-offs decreased 10 basis points from the prior year and 34 basis points sequentially.","The significant improvement from the prior quarter reflects a degree of seasonality in originations and charge-offs that 30 plus delinquency rate was down eight basis points year-over-year and flat to the prior quarter, as credit performance continues to stabilize. Looking at capital on Slide 10, just a brief comment here. Common equity Tier 1 ratio remains sequentially flat at 11.4%, our capital payout ratio for the last 12 months including buybacks was 79%.","Now summarizing our results for the quarter on Slide 11, we generated 6% total loan growth and a 26% return on equity. Our consumer deposit business saw strong growth of 19% and now composes over half our total funding. With respect to credit while our charge-off rates have increased as loan growth seasons and credit conditions normalize, performance reflects positive trends across our lending products and remains consistent where their expectations and return targets.","We continue to execute on our capital plan with loan growth and capital return, helping to bring our capital ratios closer to targeted levels. Finally, we remain on track for a strong finish to 2019, achieving all aspects of our financial and operational guidance.","In conclusion, this was a great quarter with solid execution by the team. Now before I go to Q&A, I wanted to say again how excited I am to be part of the Discover team. I look forward to helping the business continue its history of strong execution as we grow this great franchise.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, Erica to open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thank you. Roger, I was hoping you could comment on significance of today's announcement around Click to Pay and what you think it could mean for the business?","Roger Hochschild","So in terms of the announcement on SRC, we are very excited as a member of EMVCo to be part of that. I think it's really fundamentally going to be great for consumers. It reflects the industry moving forward to significantly enhance the online checkout experience. I think it'll be a great step forward. So we're very excited to be part of it.","Mark DeVries","Okay. In terms of just what it can mean though in terms of volumes or defending market share, anything else you could share on that?","Roger Hochschild","I think it\u2019s probably too early to talk about share shift, but to the extent that we\u2019re working with other networks on a seamless integrated customer experience. We think that\u2019ll help our cardholders and be good for our business.","Mark DeVries","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good afternoon.","Roger Hochschild","Hey, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Two questions related, Roger just wanted to understand, you had a really strong quarter on the revenue side and the expense ratio came in nicely as well, but it looks like there was a little bit of investment spend going on the quarter. How should we think about that? Is there a kind of expense ratio you\u2019re looking to run between? Or was this just a quarter where you had an opportunity to invest a little bit more and so you opt the investment spend this quarter or should we expect this level of investment spend to continue from here?","Roger Hochschild","We don\u2019t necessarily target in an efficiency ratio to the point you are making, our investment spend, as we see opportunities to drive loan growth consistent with our conservative approach to credit, we will do so. And we think more in terms of overall returns. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best within financial services, but in terms of overall expense levels, those can vary based on the marketing investment.","Betsy Graseck","And then as we think about the NII and the NIM, I think John you were mentioning that you are largely neutral and you\u2019ve got one more rate cut baked into your outlook. But we should expect NIM comes down a little bit. So I\u2019m just trying to square that and maybe get a little bit of more understanding as to what you\u2019re expecting over the next couple of quarters from a NIM perspective.","John Greene","Certainly, happy to take that. So we ended the third quarter year-to-date results with a NIM rate at 10.45%. And then as we look at the fourth quarter, there\u2019s really three things that are going to impact it. So certainly the rate cuts that occurred throughout 2019 will be fully baked in. And then we\u2019ll have our funding rate, which actually ticked up mildly. And then of course in the fourth quarter, there\u2019s transactor and revolver mix shifts that ultimately will impact the rate.","So I know the company gave some guidance at 10, 10.3, and then it was subsequently revised upward by 5 basis points to 9 basis points. I would expect based on what we\u2019re seeing here looking at the fourth quarter to come in probably at the higher end of that and probably 1 basis point or 2 basis points higher than 10.39, so probably 10.4-ish.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Yes. Roger, so looks like the card business is hitting on a lot of cylinders, credits, pretty stable, competition stable, demand is decent from the consumer. I guess I wanted to just get your thoughts on whether or not you see any risks to that in the near-term. Obviously, we\u2019re all focusing on the back row, but for example, is your sense that the delinquency rate year-over-year is going to continue to be in this sort of zip code, and if you\u2019re seeing any type of movement within segments of higher end to mid prime?","Roger Hochschild","Yes. So we spend a lot of time looking for turns in the economy, looking at our portfolio kind of every way we can cut it whether it\u2019s a geographically, we look at the different vintage buckets, et cetera. And as I said on the call that the U.S. consumer is holding up well. I think part of it is reflected in terms of the fifth-year low in unemployment. But we remain disciplined and conservative and credit, because it feels late cycle and certainly is by any historic measure. But in terms of what you see in consumer behavior and the numbers we\u2019ve reported the consumer is holding up very well.","Don Fandetti","And then I guess if you look around at the other networks, there\u2019s a lot of talk about B2B. We\u2019re seeing a lot of bolt-on acquisitions for the payment companies. Where you in terms of your thought process on B2B, I know you have a small business card that\u2019s pretty modest. And then do you think you need to make any type of bolt-on acquisitions at this point are you in good shape?","Roger Hochschild","So in terms of B2B, we\u2019re always looking at opportunities, but I think we tend to think about it in terms of a mix of acquisitions but also partnerships. So we see a lot of B2B volume coming through our partnership with SAP and Ariba. We announced a new B2B space partnership this quarter. So it\u2019s an area we\u2019re focused on. Margins tend to be a little thinner on the B2B side compared to the B2C payments. But it\u2019s an area that we focused on for quite a while in the payments part of our business.","Don Fandetti","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. I guess I\u2019ve got a question on the private student loan credit quality, and the nice improvement in the reserve right there. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen some pretty significant improvement in the charge-off rate and the associated coverage with the reserve came down quite a bit. Is it just a reflection of the delinquency rate trajectory and you expect that to continue and sort of what\u2019s driving that improvement?","John Greene","Sanjay, this is John. I\u2019ll take that. So we\u2019re really pleased with the performance there. And first of all, the book is really solid. About 90% of the portfolio has co-signers. And in the first quarter of this year, the collection team began a outreach to co-signers when there was a early stage delinquency. And that\u2019s actually made a pretty substantial difference and collection effectiveness and overall delinquency levels.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. I guess question for Roger sort of similar to what Don was asking. I guess the ROEs have been really, really strong. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re surprised at how strong they are given where we are in the cycle. It seems like with such high returns you\u2019d have more competition, but there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot. So I\u2019m just curious how to reconcile. Is it something you guys are doing differently that\u2019s generating these returns? Or is it just at the competitive intensity is weaker because where this fought late into a cycle?","Roger Hochschild","Yes, I probably would challenge the view that there isn\u2019t much competition in the card space. If you look at the players who are in it and the investments they make, I think part of it is, it is a very challenging business. So you tend not to see too many new entrance, but it is very competitive. And I think there\u2019s a difference between the marginal return that competitors look to as they think about how to grow their book and the total return. But I think the credit card business has been one of the highest returning consumer asset classes for my 25 years in the business. And I think it reflects just sort of some of the challenges and operating it well and we have a very discipline model here at Discover.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. I wanted to welcome and congratulate John on his new position and just one quick clarification. The NIM guidance that you provided was that a fourth quarter guide or was that for the full year?","John Greene","That was fourth quarter. So when we come out with yearend results in January, we\u2019ll provide updated guidance for 2020.","Sanjay Sakhrani","All right, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","All right, thanks very much. So just to circle back on the credit discussion for a moment. Certainly the NCO trends seem very contained and the delinquency trends also seem to be very contained in terms of the rate of change. On the other hand, the late fees are creeping up. That\u2019s often a harbinger of a future credit deterioration. You guys have talked a little bit about what you\u2019re doing on mod. So I\u2019m just trying to put the whole picture together. Is the characterization that it\u2019s stable, but with a slow slope towards deterioration, or how should I think about it?","Roger Hochschild","Yes. I think I would probably highlight more of the stable side, part of what\u2019s driving up late fees is just overall growth in the portfolio. And certainly that\u2019s going to drive more delinquent accounts. But as you look at the overall delinquency rates and the trajectory those have been on, I think those reflect strong performance in a continued stable economic environment.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thank you for that. And if I may just follow-up just quickly on NIM as well, without pushing you to provide point guidance which is not my intent. But I think in the past, what you\u2019ve indicated is every incremental 25 basis points reduction is 1 to 2 points of annualized NIM reduction. And so as we just think through whether it\u2019s our own economist or the Blue Chip consensus in terms of the 2020 expectation. Is that still a good framework to consider on the basis of the fourth quarter endpoint.","John Greene","Eric, it is 1 to 2 basis points for every 25 basis points downward.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great, thanks very much.","Roger Hochschild","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good afternoon, guys. And John, congrats on joining Discover.","John Greene","Oh, thank you.","Ryan Nash","Roger, maybe I\u2019ll start with a similar question that some of the others have asked. So you\u2019ve been tightening credit for two years, yet you\u2019re still growing above the market. So one, do you think this could continue? And two, what do you think that you\u2019re doing different from the market now that\u2019s allowing you to continue to take share?","Roger Hochschild","I feel good about the credit decisions we\u2019ve made and there are a mix of what we do for new accounts, but also for the portfolio. A lot of it has to do with differentiation. And so we focused a lot on innovation. So if you think about going back to the FICO score on statements, the ability to freeze your card, Cashback Match continues to perform well for us. And then also focusing on a superior customer experience. We\u2019ve won the J.D. Power Award for five of the last six years. We have the best mobile app in the business.","So really that yes, relentless focus on every part of the customer experience. And then wrapping that with the Discover brand, which obviously having our own proprietary network helps us in terms of building that brand and providing differentiation. So yeah, I think the whole business model is focused on driving high quality loan growth.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Maybe one for John last quarter or the end the quarter before the company had outlined the upfront impact regarding CECL. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the day two impact. How to think about the impact for a company that\u2019s experiencing nice growth yet still seeing supply driven normalization in a very uncertain macro backdrop. Thanks.","John Greene","Yes, thank you. Good question. So let me start by saying that we\u2019re looking at CECL and the impact pretty extensively. We have now three quarters of simulations. We expect the overall reserve rate to be somewhere between 55 and 65 in the two most recent quarters that it\u2019s trending to the north end of that. We\u2019ll continue to monitor that and it will be impacted by the composition of the portfolio and certainly macro factors. So none of that is probably new to the folks on the call.","In terms of the volatility, it is \u2013 it does drive a level of volatility. And we are \u2013 frankly I\u2019m holding off on giving a quantification on the volatility until we that down the estimates and clearly have a view of what the portfolio will look like and also the macro economics. So it will be more volatile. And we\u2019ll provide disclosures. They provide a clear view on an apples to apple basis, so non-GAAP disclosures that will align to 2019 GAAP, so let there\u2019s comparability.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.","Roger Hochschild","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Yes, thanks for taking my questions and welcome aboard, John. Maybe a couple more questions on the credit side, maybe more hypothetical. We\u2019re \u2013 listen, we\u2019re obviously closing it on four years of everybody wondering whether we\u2019re in the eighth or ninth inning of this cycle and the data has suggested otherwise. But I\u2019m wondering two things, just hypothetically, whether this occurred in one quarter or six quarters from now.","If you had any indicators whether internally based on delinquency trends or even macro indicators, suggesting we\u2019re heading towards let\u2019s say a 5.5% to 6% unemployment environment, which is consistent with two recessions ago, going to ignore the great recession. Trying to get a sense, and I realize there are so many variables and inputs, but generally speaking from a strategic standpoint, should we be thinking about Discover is a business that is still targeting some level of loan growth in the midst of that kind of environment, sort of flat or year-over-year decline. I realize it\u2019s very hypothetical just trying to get a sense for how to think about at this stage of maturity how the business operates in that type of macro backdrop.","Roger Hochschild","Yes. I can\u2019t really sort of comment on exactly how much we grow at what unemployment level. I would say though that is, we look at the new accounts we book and the models that John and the finance team do. We use the through the cycle of loss rate as opposed to where we are at any given point in time. And we\u2019ve spent a lot of time analyzing accounts that we book through the last downturn. The vast majority of our new accounts we would have booked in December of 2007.","So even going into that time, even if we had known what was coming, the vast majority of accounts would have booked. There are certain segments that are sort of more in the near prime side that are more volatile. And so those tend to be where you cut back, you cut back on the number of line increases you do, and there are other actions on the portfolio. But again, most \u2013again, the vast majority of those new accounts, we use the through the cycle loss rate and book in a much more challenging credit environment than what we have next.","David Scharf","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a follow-up along those lines, once again, this is hypothetical, but maybe it\u2019s something you could quantify for us. If the loan book in aggregate starting today, I mean the back book today were to be flat over the next 12 months. Is there any sense you could give us in basis points of how much upward pressure on loss rates just the pure seasoning would exert if we no longer had any contributing denominator effect?","Roger Hochschild","That\u2019s something we really couldn\u2019t put together. I mean we don\u2019t run a scenarios of our loan book flat, because we\u2019re going to keep trying to grow it. But I really can\u2019t answer that.","David Scharf","Got it. Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Look the uptake on the rewards program that PayPal was very strong during the quarter. I\u2019m curious if you could help us understand tactically what the intent of that program is. Is it a demographic drive from millennials or is there something else we should be thinking about?","Roger Hochschild","Sure. So a lot of our programs do in fact target millennials. PayPal is a great business partner both on our issuing side as well as on the payment side. And with some merchants like PayPal, you do get a bit of a lock in, because once people change their default card, they are tends to be a tail of sales. So we\u2019re always looking for how to use our rewards dollars to cost effectively drive growth and provide value for our customers. I think it's one of the advantages we have from the structure of our rewards program. And so that was an investment we made and we're excited about what we're seeing in terms of cardholder pickup of that.","Rick Shane","Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for answering the question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a couple of follow-up questions. First a follow-up on Rick's PayPal 5% category question. Can you give any kind of early indication of the stickiness of those customers post promo, just trying to get a sense for the willingness of those customers to keep discover as their primary card after the promotion ends versus, how much gaming behavior you're seeing?","Roger Hochschild","I will comment specifically. I would say we've had a lot of experience running our 5% promo and know kind of by each different category of what type of tail we spend and that goes into the targeting. So, I'll go back to saying we're very excited about how it's performed and we think we're getting good value for our investment.","Bill Carcache","Okay. Thanks, Roger. And then another follow-up on Ryan's question about the day two impact of CECL, at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that the building of reserves on future growth under CECL would also increase by the 55% to 65% that you guys have guided to versus what it would have been under the incurred loss model?","Roger Hochschild","Yes. So great question. So no, to be specific on that. So the portfolio when we're putting up the 55% to 65% increase for day one reflects a maturity of the portfolio that already has some incurred losses reflected in it. So when you put up new loan accounts, what happens is you have to book the lifetime losses and therefore the impact is actually greater than the day one impact of 55% to 65% that we've talked about.","Bill Carcache","Okay. So it's like as a starting point in 55% to 65% day one impacted, the day two impact on the incremental building would actually be larger than that.","John Greene","It would for new loan account. And then obviously the macro factors would come into play there, that the type of assets we're putting on the books. So are they credit card or personal loans will impact. So there is a lot of factor. And as I said, I'm going to hold off on giving a specific number until we get it sorted out. We've got more work to do as an organization, but we're progressing well on it. And in the first quarter, we'll share that.","Bill Carcache","Got it. Thanks, John. Welcome to the team and I look forward to working with you.","John Greene","Thank you much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. And I'll also welcome you, John, look forward to working with you as well. First question is just on the direct deposits. The growth of direct deposits has been so strong and it is by far your lowest cost of funds. And I just \u2013 if you could have any thoughts around what percentage of your funding over the long-term could be through direct deposits because that's a nice tailwind obviously to your business, to your margins.","John Greene","Yes. So it is. So what we do is we concentrate on the overall funding stack and obviously it's really important to make sure we have the right level of liquidity and other funding sources in place. But with that said, as we mentioned on the prepared comments, 53% of this funding stack was from deposits. We'd like to grow that. And I think the previous guidance the business has given was in the medium term somewhere around 60%. And we'll look at that as a path forward and we may adjust upward if conditions wants.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. And follow-up call on Roger, on the competitive front. I mean you do have, one you have an Apple Card and just your thoughts around that. And then we've had some mega mergers in the payment space and they're looking for revenue synergies. And one area that one company feels like is low hanging fruit is would be related to the PULSE business. And so I just want to \u2013 if you could comment on the Apple and, and then the mega mergers and the ability of your to be able to continue to grow your payments business.","John Greene","Yes. In terms of the, the Apple Card, we've yet to see that have a noticeable impact on our volumes. So we're watching it carefully, but again no noticeable impact. In terms of the mega mergers on the payment side a, if we compete against Visa and MasterCard, so we're used to competing against very large companies and payments. A lot of it is \u2013 it's sort of a broader ecosystem where there are, in fact partnership opportunities with some of those companies as well. So, at present it's too early to understand this, the full impact on PULSE, but our goal is to be able to compete globally against anyone in the payments industry.","Bob Napoli","Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Chris Donat","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I had one on the professional fees and the increase in them. And does that represent some sort of change in how you're doing collections? Like are using rather than first party or in-house collections are using more third party collections or is it just something else going on there?","John Greene","Chris, thanks for the question. No. what actually you see there is a pretty substantial increase in overall recovery. So recoveries third quarter 2019 versus third quarter 2018 are up about 32%. So that drives obviously a bit of the \u2013 I'll call it commission for the third-party collectors.","Chris Donat","Okay. Got it. And then just one more on CECL. As you talk about the volatility's you get more experienced with the sort of the parallel run of CECL, does that affect how you might be thinking about capital in 2020 and beyond of maybe needing to have a little more pressure and recognizing that there's a phase in from a regulatory perspective for CECL? Or is that too soon to tell?","John Greene","Yes. So there will be a capital impact, right? The phase in is 25% over four year period. It doesn't change the underlying cash flows of the business. So we're going to continue to try to optimize the capital base and we're progressing excluding CECL towards a target level of 10.5% So we'll present a capital plan to the board and to the regulators and see what that looks like in 2020.","Chris Donat","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Thanks very much. Welcome, John. Most of my questions were asked, maybe going to dive a little bit into the consumer behavior. So for new customers that you're attracting at this point, are they more \u2013 are they reacting more to zero balance transfers, or what are the promotional factors are \u2013 you're having heavy reactions at this point?","John Greene","We always try and bring in cardholders that are not just balanced transfer active, but use their card as well. And so the cash back match continues to perform very well for us. But that probably is the other thing that's impacting new customers. But again, we focus on customer experience. We focus on line assignment, every component is important. But I'd probably highlight that cash back max is sort of the biggest thing we have for new cardholders.","John Hecht","Okay. And you mentioned the lines that the \u2013 any changes to utilization rates? Are those behaviors been pretty consistent as well?","John Greene","We haven't \u2013 I'll go back. We have not picked up signs of distress in our portfolio as we look.","John Hecht","So utilization rates just stable as expected?","John Greene","Yes.","John Hecht","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank.","Meng Jiao","Hi, good afternoon guys. Quick question on I guess a loan growth, just from simple back the envelope math, I mean loan growth and need to I guess, accelerate have been 4Q to reach that low end of that six to eight prior guidance range. I'm wondering if you guys could provide any color on it and do you still expect that to be true or, and where are you seeing the most strength there? Thanks.","John Greene","I won't comment on the guidance. I would say if you look at the quarter, we feel very good about our card loan growth. We feel good about how student loans perform in the peak season. And we had talked about really a lower growth rate for personal loans in terms of expectations for this year, as we tested our new credit models for some segments that had not performed as well as we wanted. We're excited about how those are doing as well. So again, we feel good about our ability to achieve loan growth. It'll of course depend on the holiday season. But so far consumers seem to be in a pretty good space.","Meng Jiao","Gotcha. Great. And then my second question is just on overall international acceptance, I think, mid quarter you mentioned that international acceptance was somewhere in the seventh inning. And I know in your prepared remarks you mentioned focusing more on Africa as well as Western Europe. I like to get any sort of updated thoughts you had there in terms of innings and how you see discover progressing internationally going forward?","John Greene","You know, the seventh inning is quite long. We may go to extra innings. So maybe that, that's not the best way to phrase it. It will be a continued investment and I think Africa just gives you an example of the breadth of our investments. We're also working with network partners everywhere from Eastern Europe to Asia to South America. A particular focus has been on Western Europe and working with acquirers there. So you heard us announce a number of partnerships, so we will continue to build out our global acceptance footprint.","Meng Jiao","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Hi, good evening.","John Greene","Hi, Brian.","Brian Foran","Maybe just on the deposit betas, the 50% so far was interesting and I think most of the traditional banks are struggling to get, 15% 20% beta so far. Is your feeling that that's a timing issue, i.e., it's easier for you and peers to lower the online deposit rates and reprice most of these most of the book quickly? Or are you more encouraged that, maybe the betas could just be higher on online deposits throughout a fed easing cycle?","John Greene","Yes, I mean, I think if you compare to a lot of the more traditional brand space things, they tend to have a lower beta. A lot of it has to do with their product mix. And so having more in checking or in savings accounts and are paying in the \u2013 sometimes in the single digit basis points, they pay through operating expenses as opposed to the rate. So, I think there's a natural symmetry between the betas you experienced on the way up and what you have on the way down. And so a lot of those banks captured the rate increases on the way up and didn't move their rates much at all, but unfortunate it doesn't give you much room to adjust when rates are coming back down.","Brian Foran","Got it. And then two small things on the, one on the loan fees, when you referenced the changes that drove it to 120 versus kind of around 105 before, does it all else equal stay around 120 or does it go back to 105 as we think about putting something in the model going forward.","John Greene","So that's a function of the late payments and also the pricing tiers that we put in place. So, I would expect a little, certainly a tick up based on history, but some of it will be tied obviously to late payments and in that, you'll be able to see the trends there.","Brian Foran","And then, I hate to ask for a clarification up the clarification of the NIM guidance, but I managed to get myself tripped up when you were kind of saying a basis point or two above deal, 10.39 high end that was for the full year, we should think about 10.40?","John Greene","Yes. Thanks for that clarification question. Yes, it would be for the full year.","Brian Foran","Okay. So 4Q 10.3% plus or minus is, is kind of the implied output of that?","John Greene","Yes. You solve the math and\u2026","Brian Foran","I wouldn't put a lot of trust in that, so I figured I'd ask. I appreciate it. Thank you.","John Greene","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Mahir [ph] on for Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. And firstly, congratulations John, on joining the team up. The first question, I think if I could go back where we started, I guess back to the quick to pay or the unified payment, button and I was just curious, will you be putting any promotional efforts around getting your cardholders to enroll their Discover cards or make them default in on that button?","John Greene","I think we're in the early stages of implementation, clearly we try and make sure that our cardholders are using Discover and I think this is where there may be an advantage for us in terms of our integrated network and card issuer model. We can enable it probably more seamlessly than, someone who uses a third-party issuer. You know, as an example, we were the first ones to be able to provision Apple Pay from within our app. So we'll look for opportunities where we can make the experience more seamless for Discover card holders.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks for that. And then just around \u2013 I just had a question around credit and just your net charge-off guidance. I think you've mentioned 3.2% to 3.4% for the year. And I was just doing the rough math here, looking at of how you perform the year-to-date, is there a potential for it to come in a little better than that or are you sticking with, or at least the very low end of that? Just because, I mean, it sounds like you're pretty favorable on credit and looking at year-to-date performance and Q3 performance, it need to be pretty meaningful quarter-over-quarter degradation to get, but the higher end of that, certainly.","John Greene","Yes. So thanks for that. So yes, the guidance was 3.2% to 3.4% and we're certainly performing at the lower end of that. At this point I'll probably just pause there and say that lower end of the guidance and if you choose to put something else in your model be comfortable with it.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom","Thanks. Good afternoon.","John Greene","Good afternoon.","Jon Arfstrom","Great. Just a quick one on deposit growth. Curious if you had to put your finger on what's driving it, would you say that new deposit account growth is tracking with overall deposit account growth or using something like higher average balances on existing accounts or is it both, if that makes sense?","John Greene","Yes. No, it's both. So we're attracting new customers, but we're also seeing some of our existing customers build their balances, whether it's adding another CD or just putting more money into the savings accounts. So it's a mix of both from new as well as existing customers.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. All right. Thank you.","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Streem, your closing comments, please?","Craig Streem","Thanks, Erica. Thank you all for your attention, for your questions. And you know where to find us for any follow-up. Thanks. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Bill Franklin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Sabrina. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is on the investor relations section of Discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the fourth quarter 2015 earnings material, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated.","So now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our key focus areas for 2016. Then, I will hand it over to Mark to review the fourth quarter in more detail and share some forward-looking guidance.","Starting on slide three of our earnings presentation, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $500 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.14, up 31%, due to some one-time charges in the prior year. We were able to drive a return on equity of 18% for the quarter, despite higher loan loss provisions and higher non-recurring expenses driven by the anti-money laundering look back.","Turning to slide four, Discover achieved total loan growth of 3.5% over the prior year. Card receivables grew 3% this quarter, lower than we would like, however, this was partly due to lower promotional balance growth compared to the prior period. Total sales for the quarter increased 3% from the prior year or roughly 5% excluding gas sales. Lower gas prices have continued to impact our sales and card loan growth more than we had anticipated, however, we believe it also somewhat helped credit results in 2015.","Moving to our next largest asset class, private student loans grew 3%. However, excluding our acquired portfolios, we achieved 16% growth year-over-year. Personal loans increased to $5.5 billion, up 10% from the prior year.","On the right-hand side of slide four, we lay out payments volume growth. Proprietary volume continued to increase in support of the card issuing business, however, our third party payment segment had lower volume compared to the prior year. A large part of the volume in this segment comes from PULSE, where we saw continued declines in the challenging post-Durbin environment. Performance was good in the other network businesses, although they represent a much smaller portion of the total payments volume. Network Partners volume increased significantly, driven by AribaPay volumes, while Diners volume decreased slightly as reported, but was up nicely on a constant dollar basis.","Now, I'm going to touch on our full year financial results, shown on slide five. In 2015, our earnings crossed the $5 per share mark for the first time. Revenue increased 3% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. Moving down this slide, provisioning grew roughly in line with the average loan growth. Expense growth was primarily driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs, particularly related to our AML consent order remediation. Due to the strength of our capital generation and buyback program, EPS increased 5% for the full year versus 2014.","Moving to slide six, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 to move the business forward. We continued to grow our balance sheet with total loans up 3.5% from the prior year. We introduced new features and benefits throughout the year to attract and retain customers. In card, we introduced the innovative Freeze It capability, which allows customers to suspend their credit card with a few clicks from their app in the event it's misplaced. I can personally attest to how well it works. And we offered a promotional 10% cash back bonus on in-store purchases using the Apple Pay, which drove adoption in our card base and also attracted some new card members to Discover.","At the same time, we continued to be disciplined in managing credit, as our total net charge-off rate excluding PCI loans declined 5 basis points. Our card loss rate remains among the lowest in the industry. We also achieved record originations in our non-card loans. We increased brand awareness for student loans through radio advertising and The Freshman Experience, a unique partnership with NBC News. In December, we launched FAFSA Assistant, a free tool to help families navigate government student aid filings and educate prospective students about their funding options, which should continue to increase Discover student loan awareness in 2016.","In personal loans, we launched several new digital initiatives to help drive growth. In payments, the competitive landscape in debit remains challenging. In 2015, we established new partnerships, including network-to-network agreements, new Diners Club licensees, and at the same time, we grew volume with existing payment partnerships like AribaPay.","Perhaps most importantly, the Discover Network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business, as evidenced by the fact that we are accepted at more than 37 million locations worldwide, roughly 20% more than a year ago. As we look back on 2015, we feel good about our accomplishments. We generated a 21% return on equity for the full year, and repurchased 6% of our stock.","Now, let's move to slide seven. For 2016, our vision is unchanged. We aspire to be the leading U.S. direct bank and payments partner. Our key focus areas for the year will help us move forward towards accomplishing our vision. In 2016, we are targeting faster loan growth, which you will see in the guidance that Mark goes through later in the call. We expect this growth to be balanced between new accounts and our existing portfolio. Discover it continues to perform well in the marketplace, helped by the double cash back bonus offer for new card members during the first year.","While we anticipate the majority of our new account growth will come from our flagship Discover it card, we expect to see additional growth from our Miles it card and the recently launched secured card. To support the growth of the Miles it card we introduced last year, we've recently aired our first television advertisement to increase awareness of the product and features. In addition, we announced the broad market launch of the Discover it secured card on Monday. This product will give customers who are new to credit access to the features and the benefits of a Discover it product, fully secured by a cash deposit. This is another opportunity for us to reach new customers and retain them, as they develop a strong credit history.","In the existing portfolio, we have a number of initiatives, some of which are already underway, to support loan growth, including a strategy to re-engage inactives when they receive their EMV card, appropriate credit line increases for eligible customers, and profitable balance transfers. Underlying all these initiatives is our commitment to a disciplined approach to credit management, which has served Discover well through previous credit cycles.","In addition, we will continue to build out our digital capabilities with enhanced customer features. By the end of the month, we will have completed the full rollout of our unique Pay with Cashback functionality, online and in our app. This will offer customers the ability to pay their monthly card bill using their cashback bonus seamlessly. We continue to innovate in the features and benefits that drive customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.","Moving down the slide, in 2016 we will be very focused on operating expense leverage. Historically we've had one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. While our 2015 ratio was elevated due to some one-time items, we are managing the business to trend back towards our long-term target. In 2016, we expect to invest in growth and to see increases in ongoing compliance costs while also finding ways to optimize the core expense base.","We have a unique set of payment assets which present many long-term opportunities for us. Near term, we are focused on getting the most from our proprietary network for our card issuing business, including increased acceptance and brand differentiation. While Payment Services has struggled with some third-party volume losses, we expect volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year and we continue to seek opportunities to bring more volume from third parties on to our network. We are looking broadly across this segment; domestically, internationally, in business to business, and in consumer payments. We have the ability to scale significantly and are committed to driving value.","In 2016, we will be particularly focused on closing out our AML look-back and continuing to enhance our compliance-related functions. Investing in compliance and risk management will enable us to meet increasing regulatory requirements while also strengthening our operations and supporting our leadership position in customer service. And lastly, we will optimize our capital deployment so we can consistently deliver strong returns to our shareholders while driving quality organic growth.","We have big goals for 2016, and are hard at work to achieve them. We're especially working to accelerate profitable loan growth.","Now, I will turn the call to Mark to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results and forward-looking guidance. Mark?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on slide eight of our presentation. Net interest income increased $60 million or 4% over the prior year due to loan growth. Total non-interest income was up $108 million. I would remind you that the prior year period included a one-time charge of $178 million related to the elimination of the rewards forfeiture reserve. Excluding this one-time item in the prior year, non-interest income declined $70 million.","The rewards rate was 118 basis points, up 8 basis points from the prior year on an adjusted basis, largely due to the double rewards program for new card members as well as our fourth quarter Apple Pay promotion.","Protection products revenue continues to decline, down $15 million year-over-year, given our suspension of sales in late 2012. Other revenue decreased $30 million, primarily due to the loss of mortgage origination revenue as we closed our direct mortgage operation this year.","Payment Services revenue was down $14 million, primarily due to lower transaction processing revenue at PULSE. This was largely the result of the previously disclosed loss of volume from a large debit issuer.","Turning to slide nine. Total loan yield of 11.49% was up 9 basis points over the prior year. This higher yield was offset by higher funding costs and a larger liquidity portfolio. Combined, these drove net interest margin on receivables down 1 basis point from the prior year to 9.75%. However, on a sequential basis, NIM expanded by 13 basis points, driven by higher card yield due to portfolio mix.","Personal loans were the only asset class where the yield declined from the prior year. Shorter terms year-over-year and a $5 million one-time adjustment to deferred loan origination cost drove the decline. As the origination cost adjustment was nonrecurring, we would expect that in the first quarter of 2016, personal loan yields will rebound to levels roughly in line with the third quarter of 2015.","Turning to slide 10, total operating expense was roughly flat, in part because both periods included some one-time items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized $48 million in charges in other expenses associated with two items. First, a $27 million impairment of goodwill related to the mortgage origination business, which we subsequently exited. And second, a $21 million mark to fair value related to Diners Club Italy being classified as held for sale, which we've now sold.","In the current period, we incurred $37 million in expense resulting from the anti-money laundering look-back project. Adjusting for these items, expenses were $12 million or 1% higher year-over-year.","Turning to provision for loan losses in credit on slide 11, provision for loan losses was higher by $27 million, due primarily to a higher reserve build compared to the prior year. As David mentioned earlier, provision growth on a full year basis was essentially in line with average loan growth. The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.18%, down 8 basis points year-over-year and up 14 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was relatively flat year-over-year at 1.72%, and up 7 basis points from the prior quarter. The private student loan net charge-off rate excluding purchase credit impaired loans decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 1.3%. The 30-plus day delinquency rate increased by 11 basis points over the prior year to 1.9% as the organic book continues to enter repayment.","Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 8 basis points year-over-year to 2.3%, due to the seasoning of newer vintages in line with expectations, and the over 30 day delinquency rate was up 10 basis points to 89 basis points. Across all of our portfolios, we remain pleased with our strong credit results.","Next, I'll touch on our capital position on slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.9%. The sequential decrease in our capital ratios was driven by a combination of seasonal loan growth and capital deployment. On that latter point, we repurchased $435 million of stock in the quarter. In total during 2015, we returned over $2 billion in capital to shareholders with a 94% payout ratio. To complete the repurchases we submitted as part of last year's CCAR capital actions, we plan to buy back over $800 million of shares in the first half of 2016.","Moving to long-term guidance on slide 13. The majority of these items have not changed since our last investor day. So I'll focus only on the two that have changed and are circled on the page. I would remind you that the items on this page represent expected averages through the cycle, and do not necessarily reflect our expectations for 2016. Going forward we'll be guiding to total loan growth as opposed to the component pieces. We expect long-term total loan growth of 4% to 6%. Consistent with this change, we've also updated the long-term guidance to reflect the total net charge-off rate excluding PCI loans, which we expect to be 3% to 4%.","Turning to slide 14, let's spend a minute on guidance that is specific to 2016. First, we expect total loan growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%, in line with our long-term target. Keep in mind that card represents roughly 80% of our portfolio. So achieving 4% to 6% total loan growth requires us to accelerate card growth from the recent trend.","On that last point, I want to remind you of a nuance in how we report our monthly loan data. We don't process payments for the card business on Saturdays. So when a month ends on a Saturday, our 8K reported receivables include Saturday's sales, but no payments from that day. This can create distortions in year-over-year comparisons. A good rule of thumb is to expect a positive bump of 50 basis points to 60 basis points to the year-over-year growth when the current month ends on a Saturday, and to expect a drag of 50 basis points to 60 basis points when the prior year month ends on a Saturday. Obviously, this is just a timing impact, but we are calling it out because both January and February ended on a Saturday last year. As a result, our relative year-over-year growth will be understated in our reporting for each of those months this year.","Moving to our outlook for net interest margin in 2016, we expect it to be what I would call relatively stable when compared to our full year 2015 NIM of 9.68%, perhaps with a bit of an upward bias. Further increases in rates would benefit us, based on the modest asset sensitivity we built into the balance sheet. But we may also see some offsets depending upon the level of card promotional activity and runoff in higher rate and default-priced balances.","With respect to rewards, we're planning to spend more on a full-year basis in 2016. Specifically, we expect the full year rate around 115 basis points or roughly 7 basis points higher than 2015. A good portion of the increase is the first year double rewards program, which has delivered a lower cost per account and brought on more engaged customers; well worth the investment.","Moving to non-interest, non-interchange revenue, as we've said throughout 2015, we expect this line item to be lower this year. The primary drivers are the exit of the direct mortgage origination product, which generated roughly $74 million in revenue in 2015; continued runoff in protection products revenue, which we estimate to be about $40 million lower in 2016; and lower Payment Services revenue, in part reflecting the sale of the Diners Club Italy franchise. Taking all of this into account, we expect non-interest, non-interchange revenue to decline approximately $125 million in 2016.","Moving to the total net charge-off rate ex-PCI loans, we expect it to be slightly higher than 2015. The credit environment continues to feel benign, with our reserve build in the fourth quarter reflective of the seasoning of several years of card loan growth at levels above the portfolio charge-off rate, in line with our expectations. In addition, we assume a more modest outlook for improvement in the U.S. economy in 2016.","Finally, we expect operating expense to be slightly above $3.5 billion next year. This reflects the roll off of the AML\/BSA look back expenses over the course of 2016, incremental expenses for ongoing regulatory and compliance costs that are facing all participants in the industry, initiatives to accelerate loan growth, as well as operating efficiency improvements. Based on this level of expense, we expect to drive positive operating leverage and decrease our efficiency ratio, which is already one of the lowest among large banks.","To close things out, we have a business model that is generating strong returns on equity. While third party payment volume has declined recently, we expect our Payment Services segment volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year. This should position us for growth in future years, which is why we are keeping our long-term payments volume growth target at 10%.","Near term, we are very focused on the remediation of our AML\/BSA consent order and reducing expenses in 2016. We'll be focused on accelerating total loan growth in a disciplined fashion, focusing on opportunities that are profitable for the long term, and not sacrificing credit for the sake of growth.","Last but not least, we have a strong capital position that enables us to both invest in the business to drive growth and deliver prudently aggressive payouts to shareholders within the constraints the CCAR process. That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I'll turn the call back to our operator Sabrina to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, David or Mark, I just wanted to confirm the reserve build this quarter was just sort of a seasonality and you're not seeing anything at least today that would suggest any weakening in the overall portfolio. I was wondering if you can comment on that. And I know in the past, you've provided a provision to average loan ratio. Would you care to provide that for 2016?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, on the fourth quarter number, Don, I would say the card reserve rate was 2.68% this quarter, I believe. And over the last five quarters to six quarters it's been pretty consistently in that 2.6% to 2.7% range. So I would say, you know, it's consistent. The provision really on a full-year basis is consistent with the loan growth on a full-year basis which is kind of, I think, what we've been saying people should be expecting. So, no, we don't see any change at all in the dynamics of the portfolio. Our guidance for next year reflects what I called, I think, a slight increase in charge-offs. We still expect that to remain clearly in the low 2%s range. I think, we learned our lesson last year trying to give provision guidance and we're shying away from that this year and just sticking with charge-offs.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then on the rewards obviously going up for good reasons, but I was just curious, would your sense be that that's likely to sort of \u2013 if you are wrong, maybe you're going to tick a little higher or are you being pretty conservative? It seems like competition is going to remain pretty healthy into 2016.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, we've given guidance based on what we expect. Certainly that can always be a little higher or a little lower than guidance depending on \u2013 because there's a lot of promotional decisions that we make along the way, and so it could vary from that, but what I would say is that it's less about competition and more about us doing tests and controls and deciding what to spend in rewards versus the marketing line and what has the best net present values for new accounts and stimulating the portfolio and that means that has led to higher spend over time in this line.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say the big driver, Don, is the double rewards program on new accounts and that's driving a very low CPA, cost per account acquired right now. And the customers who are coming on with the new accounts are driving very engaged type behaviors, that we expect to materialize in loan growth as we move forward throughout 2016. So, I think, it's a pretty potent investment right now is the bottom line, based on what we see; but I would echo David's comment, it's something that we look at from time to time and could change. As always if we update our outlook and our guidance, you'll know about it.","Bill Franklin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. I guess 2015 was a year of lot of surprises on the expense line. As we look towards 2016, how much execution risk is there in terms of surprises not popping up on expenses? I mean, do you guys feel like, you know, you have enough levers available to you so that if there are surprises, you could still meet your expectations? And secondly, just to Mark, could you define slight in terms of the increase for charge-offs? Thank you.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So on the first point, Sanjay, what I would say is, look, we clearly have expense levers. You make decisions from time to time on whether or not you want to pull those levers, right? We knew that the look back project for the AML\/BSA was going to be big dollars. We knew it was one-time nonrecurring and cutting muscle that drives the business forward didn't make a lot of sense, right in that regard. That being said, we covered an awful lot of ongoing expense increases in regulatory and compliance world with operating efficiency gains this year. I think you should look to see us do the same next year. Candidly, I think, we kind of landed right on top, more or less, of our OpEx guidance for the full year for this past year, came in I think, $15 million over, something like that, but on a $3.6 billion line item, kind of feel like we did a decent job. That notwithstanding, I think at the end of the day, there clearly are levers we can pull when it makes sense to pull them.","With respect to what is a slight increase in charge-offs? I kind of reiterate what I said to Don, maybe expand on it a little bit. It's going to stay clearly in the low 2% range, Sanjay. We do not see any signs of a turn in the credit environment. We are operating with many years of growth, seasoning in the portfolio right now, and as we've said, new account season at loss rates higher than legacy portfolio. So there's a bit of an impact there, but the credit environment itself continues to feel very benign and we're not trying to signal some giant inflection point in charge-offs.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question regarding your through the cycle guidance in terms of the loan growth, versus the charge-off rates. Given that's through the cycle and then obviously baking in consumer conservatism, I guess the question is, would it be possible that loan growth would be above kind of your 4% to 6% range at that level of charge-off rate assuming the economy is not deteriorating in any major fashion just on the part of consumer being less conservative. Is that the right way to think about that?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that on loan growth we have established a new long-term target of 4% to 6% of total loans, and we said that we were actually committed to being in that range next year, which implies some acceleration. Given that we're below that range today, I would not be looking for us to exceed it. I think, we're going to work really hard to get into the range this coming year and we think 4% to 6% would be gaining market share in prime credit cards and across our other businesses. So we think it would be a very good outcome, without taking excessive credit risk.","Charge-offs, you noticed that we have a long-term target and it's very disconnected with where we are, and what Mark said is slight increase. So clearly we expect to be significantly below that long-term range during this coming year.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And what would get you to the 3% to 4% or what factors would drive that? Is it mostly macro or are you assuming any kind of decrease in conservatism on the part of the consumer?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say macro factors. And I think that we feel like we've been in an unusually benign time period from a credit perspective. On the flip side, it's been a very lack of loan growth time for the industry, coming off of a shrinking period, but on charge-offs, it's been unusually benign, and so we're expecting over a longer period of time for things to normalize.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just if I may, one more question on the seasoning of recent growth. At what point does some of the more recent or prior vintage years start to tail off in terms of moving down the peak of the loss curve and hopefully providing some tailwind to reserving from here?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So cards are the biggest driver. They tend to peak at about 24 months after origination. So if you think about it, you have three years of vintages under the peak of the seasoning curve, if you will. A year ago is 12 months in; two years ago is at the peak; and three years ago is coming down the peak, pretty much equivalent to where a year ago was more or less. The issue is if we are successful in increasing our loan growth, you will pick that up, right? Because if you have successively larger vintages, the maturation of those vintages will drive provision. It's growth math and, candidly, I think, it's a good problem to have.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to focus again on the card business and the competitive environment. You mentioned that it's not only having an impact on your rewards rate, but we have seen an increase in the level of rewards and cashback, in particular your competition. So, maybe you could just dimensionalize, is that getting any better into your outlook. And then sort of a related follow-up. I'm surprised to see marketing investment down this quarter. I know that it was sort of lumpy quarter to quarter. But do you plan to increase marketing investment in 2016? Is some of the testing you're doing giving you some of the confidence that you're going to hit your loan growth target? Thanks.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, to handle the first one, I mean, competition is up both overall and in rewards, and I think that's particularly true in the rewards segment. But what I said before about as we have increased our rewards, it hasn't been just because we are seeing rewards of competitors. It's because we've tested into programs that we think will produce better results.","And certainly, one of the reasons that we didn't grow marketing as much in the fourth quarter is because we chose to invest more on the rewards side, particularly promotional rewards for the new accounts, as Mark mentioned, versus cost per new account. We also have been achieving some nice savings in cost per account. So the money has gone a little bit further. And, Mark, I will let you answer the second.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and as we look forward, I think the answer is we view marketing and rewards as interconnected investment. So you may see some geography flips year-on-year between those two, depending upon how we're looking to drive new account acquisition as well as utilization going forward. But I would not expect marketing expense to be flat on a year-over-year basis.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then one quick follow-up, if I could. I think I know the answer to this, but I imagine your dipping into the secured card, the subprime space, is not a part of your increased growth expectations in balances in 2016 at this point?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I would say the Miles card \u2013 of those two new products, the Miles card would probably have the greater impact. You see us advertising that on TV. Secured card, I view as a good feeder for the future. And I think as those customers in subsequent years, as we hope a number of them will exhibit good behavior, we'll be able to eventually drop the requirement of the security, get to more normal credit lines. And so I think 2017, 2018 is when you'd start to see some of the maturing of those secured cards in the prime portfolio, and that's our real objective.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, I guess first just a quick comment. I mean, I think that I would have liked to hear, given that this is a somewhat noticeable earnings disappointment, a little more urgency as to the pulling of the levers and kind of executing on the plan. I mean, given that you have some of your competitors see stable or improving loan growth even in this industry environment. So that's just kind of an observation.","But I guess my question kind of really does relate to when you think about the growth really in net interest income, because that's really the driver of your revenue stream, are you expecting to see \u2013 what is it about the new accounts? Because in other words, if you're getting record numbers of new accounts, are they not building the balances? And how should we think about the development of that to be confident in a forecast of 4%, 5%, or 6% kind of into 2016?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first, I think it's important to keep in mind the reasons growth decelerated, which a number of people that were focused particularly in the prime segment didn't see growth, saw less than we did. But one driver was the slower U.S. retail sales growth, in addition to the impact of falling gas prices, we talked about that. We also mentioned some of the actions we took to optimize the profitability of some promotional programs, so that cost us some growth.","But looking forward, we do have significant urgency in accelerating growth. That's why we've committed to that 4% to 6% total growth range for next year. And that should come both from the new account side, as well as the existing portfolio, and there's a whole range of activities that we have focused on getting more new accounts, activating them more, leveraging balance transfer, the Miles card, gaining wallet share on the portfolio side as we continue to roll out features like Freeze it. So we have a lot of range of actions because, frankly, the economy and the prime market isn't very robust. So what we have to do is continue to gain market share as we've done for several years by differentiating our products.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Arnold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good afternoon, guys. David, I was just wondering if you can talk in a bit more detail about the potential opportunity to add third-party issuers, and maybe hitting on the appeal and what you see as an opportunity is perhaps as well as the challenges of getting new partners.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, if you look at our Payment segment, obviously, PULSE has been a challenge with (37:32) and some specific volume losses, but the other parts of payments, we have actually seen some nice gains, and particularly from Ariba, which has been an important new partner. We continue to be working closely with PayPal, and I still remain optimistic that in the long term, that is going to produce some volume. We continue to make some good progress with new partners around the world. We signed the three largest banks in Brazil and with a network there, network-to-network partners. We have seen very nice growth out of our partners in China and in India on Diners Club.","So we are casting a very wide net to grow our third-party payments volume, and that's why we have still stuck to our 10% long-term growth target, even though we have been shrinking now, and so we're focused on turning that volume growth around to something positive.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cheryl Pate of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on sort of the loan growth in the card space, and sort of understand the point on rewards cost relative to marketing spend. I guess one more thing to add into the mix there is how should we think about the balance on profitable loan balance transfers, which maybe drive growth faster than rewards might take some more time to build up. Can you help us think through the dynamics there? And then secondly, just wondering if you could comment on card acquisition trends this quarter. Thanks.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I think I won't comment on card acquisitions this quarter. We'll wait until the next call to answer that, but on the first two questions, loan growth from the new accounts, we've been driving \u2013 our double cashback bonus has been driving lower cost per account and a very attractive mix of cardholders. And those customers have been \u2013 we're seeing more spend, and maybe a little less balance transfer. And what that means is those new accounts we've put on \u2013 those in the last two quarters are going to continue to build their balances into next year. And so that's one of the things we're continuing to focus on is efforts that ultimately result in balance growth, and we're really pleased with the newer accounts, but it's not as instant as the balance transfer.","Now, balance transfer, I think is still an opportunity. We pulled back a bit on balance transfer because we found some areas that we thought were not profitable, didn't meet our hurdles, but we are now pursuing some opportunities that we think will be more productive and more profitable. So, I think, we can probably do a little more balance transfer as well this year than we did last year.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and Cheryl, on the tradeoff between marketing spend and rewards spend, they are in one regard, one and the same, right? So you are trying to build awareness, build utilization, you can do that by staying front of mind in the television and elsewhere. You can also do it by providing a rewards product that, on an everyday basis, engages that customer in ways that incents them to utilize the card as well. So they are both \u2013 kind of have a common purpose of driving utilization spend and ultimate loan growth on the card.","The one thing I would follow on to David's earlier remarks with is loan growth from new accounts, from prime new accounts emerges down the road a little bit, right? So you originate the account. The account comes on the books. You begin to see the spend behavior come on to the card, but unless you're balance transferring a big balance over, right, it takes time for that utilization to build those balances up. So we continue to feel good about the ultimate impact of the new accounts we're putting on. We believe we'll begin to see through 2016 that manifest itself in loan growth, but there is a tad of a lag there.","Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Bill Franklin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on personal loans and student loans. We've talked a lot about credit card growth, where are your thoughts on those two categories going forward?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. As we mentioned, we were really pleased that we had record originations in both student loans and personal loans last year. We expect to do even more in both of those areas this coming year. One of the reasons that we moved to a total loans estimate is because those two businesses have become a bigger part of our total, and certainly the fact that we expect faster growth from those two businesses than card helps drive our overall loans up. And I guess the final thing I would say is that we're quite focused on some of the digital capabilities, enhancing our target marketing, we are doing more broad market in personal loans, and I mentioned a couple of the new endorsements or marketing features we have with NBC and others in student loans, which I think are helping to increase the awareness that Discover isn't just credit cards; it's also student loans.","Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking my question. We've heard you talk about something a little bit today that we haven't heard in a while which is gaining wallet share through line limit increases. Can you just talk about that opportunity, the pluses and the minuses there, and what makes you at this point more comfortable using that as a growth tool again?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I actually think we've been much more consistent than certain other competitors who I think went from not doing any to doing a bunch and saw a runoff and then saw big increases. We've actually been pretty steady. So I would say that we'll continue to appropriately increase lines, but I wouldn't call that out as any dramatic change for us.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. I mean, it strikes me, given that your borrowers have proven to be very responsible over time, it's a pretty convenient \u2013 or it's a pretty easy way to move up in wallet.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it is if you're careful in how you do it. And so we are giving lines where we can. We are finding some opportunities. Certainly the further we come into stable credit lines and the more stability many consumers have, the better their FICO scores are, the more history they have, it gives us greater confidence in being able to extend somewhat bigger lines. So I think both initial lines for new accounts, as well as line increases done to the right segments can be very profitable and can be done without driving up charge-offs.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is now open.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","I just want to ask questions around your expectation on the BSA\/AML cost for 2016, how we should think about that. It looks like it came in just shy of $100 million for 2015. Is that a fair level that we should assume for 2016?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say no. I would not assume that as a level for 2016. The number we've been calling out for BSA\/AML compliance we specifically identified as a project, right? This is a look back on transactions over a period of time historically. And it's got a finite end date and a finite process it runs. So that definitely bleeds off as we go into 2016, and the cost of that is included in the expense guidance that we gave earlier. So we are considering the lingering effects of that as we look at the remainder of this year.","What I would say is there are obviously ongoing costs associated with the BSA\/AML program enhancements. Those we have largely been covering with either run rate operating efficiencies that we have found to-date and we'll look to find ways to offset those expenses as we move forward, but they are fractions, very small fractions of the total number we're talking about around the project.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then just to reconfirm that expectation for the BSA\/AML cost, that is included in your 2016 expense projection of $3.5 billion, correct?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is included in it, yes.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Mark, I just wanted to quickly clarify or rather maybe make sure I've understood your expectations around allowance. It sounds like what you expect to pursue is that the allowance will grow roughly in line with projected loan growth. Is that correct?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, so the allowance will respond to what we actually see as trends in the portfolio. Based on what we see now though, we continue to believe provision increases will be largely driven by and in line with loan portfolio growth.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And so from that perspective, just mathematically, it would continue to be in the range of 2.6% to 2.7% of card loans?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It would depend on the size of the new vintage, right? If you had a meteoric increase in the size of a vintage, that could impact it, but generally speaking, I think that's a reasonable proxy for looking at the stability of the credit environment.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Just another follow-up on that point, because I think obviously I have some confusion on your comments, Mark, because when you say reserving at kind of 2.6%, 2.7% level, and they have been kind of consistently there for the last four quarters, you are referring to the reserves per loans as opposed to the provisions per loans, because provisions per loans really have bounced around a lot. And they were 2.7% this quarter, but if we look at a world where you are guiding to charge-offs in the low 2%s, and we are now at 2.7% on a reserve to loan ratio, would that imply that, at least with absent really strong loan growth, that the provision to loan should be lower in the coming quarters than they were this quarter?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So what we're specifically calling out with that number is the reserve rate for cards that we disclosed in our financial supplement. So it's just bounced around. I'm looking back, December of 2014, it was 2.63%; 2.79% in March of 2015; 2.62% in June; 2.62% in September; 2.68% now. So it's pretty consistently in that 2.6%, 2.7% range. I would tell you based on the seasoning of the growth we've put on the books over the course of the last couple years as well as the challenge that David has put in front of the team to accelerate loan growth as we go into this year as well, I would not expect the provisions to decrease.","By the same token, I would very clearly state so that I'm not misunderstood, don't expect some giant increase in that card reserve rates right now, based on what we currently see in our models.","That obviously changes, but if you think about it, Mark, the next six months are pretty well known, right? So we're reserving for 12 months out. The next six months we can pretty well see in the role buckets. It's really that period of 6 months to 12 months out where you've got a little bit of uncertainty, where your models get impacted to a degree by the macro variables and your assessment of the health and the strength of the economy and what that's going to do to a borrower. So there's always a little bit of uncertainty in this. It is a forecast, so by definition, it's wrong. You try and be as right as you can. We're thumping along the bottom of the credit cycle. We have been for a while. So there will be a little bit of volatility here. But, what I always just try to remind everybody is this is a $1.8 billion balance sheet item. So, a little bit of volatility drives some moves in EPS.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. David, I just wanted to ask on the secured credit card and your launch of that, you're typically very methodical about new products and I imagine this has been in development for some time. Can you give us some color on what sort of development process you went through and what you might have considered adding or not adding with the card or just trying to understand when you guys launch something, I know you put a lot of investment into it, so what you're getting for it.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, and this has been in test for a while. So we have experience with some accounts and we got to the point where we had enough experience that we felt that we could make it an official launch. And I would say we're certainly seeing in the marketplace right now people that are in the \u2013 lesser credits are seeing significant growth, and the prime market is really not growing hardly at all. And so we're not willing to sacrifice our credit to go into subprime, but what this product allows us to do is to get people that might currently be considered subprime to get our product and for us to be protected from losses because we have the security deposit and to work with those customers to graduate them into prime loans when they're ready. And so it is our way of new to credit or blemished credit in a way that protects our losses.","And so I guess the final thing I'd say is we did a lot of market research looking at competitive products, and we don't see anything in the marketplace that is like this. Most other cards are stripped down cards. They don't have rewards. They don't have benefits. They service the cards offshore. This is a real Discover it card with everything that comes with it. And the only thing unique is it's fully secured, and so when the credit improves, they continue that product, but it becomes unsecured.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then just related to that you said you're seeing more opportunity with the subprime side and certainly we see from other card issuers some pretty dramatic growth in loan balances in the subprime category. But are you seeing changes in consumer behavior? Like, I hear anecdotes of millennials not embracing credit cards the same way that, say, baby boomers did. Is that any part of the thesis here or is that just in the background?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's probably a component, because new to credit is part of it, and we are seeing a few more people that aren't establishing credit early on. And so they may need to start out with a secured card just because they just didn't get any credit, didn't get a credit history. So this helps address that need.","A lot of what's happening, though, is the big bounce back, in my opinion, in the subprime market because I think that declined far more a few years ago than the prime did even. And there were very few competitors in it, and now the very few people who are in subprime still, including the private labels that tend to have high yields and lower credits, are seeing a big bounce back. But it's a smaller segment than the prime segment. I think the more important thing for us is to gain share in prime, but what we want to do is identify the people that can become prime over time and get them started before they're all the way there to prime.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'll ask one about margin. You're guiding for a flat margin. Is that just I guess you're not anticipating many rate hikes this year, or is there something else going on with the trajectory of rates, yields and cost to fund that we should think about?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we are working off of an operative assumption of one or two rate increases this year as opposed to the four we were looking at in the forward curve toward the very end of last year. I would say we have not yet seen the benefit really of repricing in the card book fully from the Fed rate increase because we don't reprice card customers until cycle date. So you will get some lift from that coming in.","So I think what we're trying to say in NIM is there's an upward bias in NIM. We're well positioned right now. We may choose to invest some of that increase in NIM in marketing dollars, some promotional dollars and other places to really drive the growth that I think is the key thing we understand the market wants to see from us. So we may take some of that excess and reinvest it. Absent doing that, you would have more NIM expansion than you're likely to actually see.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And separate and distinct question. You did speak to the typical trajectory of your prime accounts and the utilization rates, but just looking at your Master Trust data, you've had elevated payment rates for some time. And I'm wondering if you can speak to kind of just generic changes you see in customer utilization or payment behaviors or is there something that's changed you think that's going to take a while to shift or that's, I guess, worthy of discussion?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would just say that the mix between balance transfer and sales can impact payment rates along with credit. And so certainly credit is great and so that tends to relate to a bit higher payments rates than one would otherwise have. But as we have shifted to a little more transaction volume turning into loans versus a little less balance transfer on new accounts that is going to impact the payment rates. And so people will tend to pay more of their sales down than they will of their balance transfer down.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","And so based on the, I guess, current marketing strategy, the elevated payment stream, do you think that stays around for a while or would we see that shift?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think that we're forecasting a big change in that relationship.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey of Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open.","Henry J. Coffey - CRT Capital Group LLC","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Mark, when you look at some of the one-time expense items outside of the AML\/BSA spending this year and last and some of the changes \u2013 you've closed down the mortgage company and then, of course, you sold off Italy. Can you give us a sense of sort of what the net impact of those two developments were? I mean, I know revenue goes down from those two, but so does some cost.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I think, Henry, some of the one-time expenses or some of the revenue reductions you see in the fee line actually are accretive to the P&L, right? So, for example, we called out $74 million in lost revenue next year from the mortgage business. I'd remind everybody when we exited the mortgage business, we said the reason we were doing it or one of the reasons we were doing it is it was not P&L accretive, right. So I think that's a very good point there.","If I think about the expense base generally right now, I think we are very lean. We are very efficient today, as evidenced by that efficiency ratio. We are always looking to find further efficiencies to get operating synergies and drive even greater returns on that.","As I said earlier, we do have some levers we can pull, if we get there, but I think those are the kind of levers you pull when you are in a turn in the credit cycle and you see things. Right now, we're still trying to drive growth, right. And I don't think you drive growth by kind of coming in and trying to whack the heck out of expenses, especially when you are already as efficient on that as we are. So we're trying to balance prudent investments in growth, maybe investing some of this additional NIM, to drive that going forward.","Henry J. Coffey - CRT Capital Group LLC","In the Payment Services business, on the international front, Diners card has gone through a lot of change, including the sale of Italy. What is the outlook there? And thank you for answering my questions.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, I feel like we have really stabilized and positioned Diners to be able to grow from this point forward. And apart from FX rates, we saw some healthy growth, some of the best growth we've seen since we owned it. I think that Citi has largely exited the franchisees that they were going to exit. We've gotten franchisees into new hands, some very strong bank partners in China, India, and Japan, and we've dramatically increased acceptance across the world. So Diners is a pretty small total volume but the trajectory, I think, looks much better now.","And certainly, selling Italy, I think positions us much better from a P&L perspective. And the final thing I would add, since Italy came up in the last question as well, I think we exited Italy. We took the hard decisions on the mortgage business to really position ourselves for the future. And so I feel like we had some one-times last year. I think they were relatively small, the total $3.5 billion spend, compared to some other companies, but we prefer to have even fewer and I think we've positioned ourselves, knock on wood, to have fewer going forward, especially as we get through this look-back. So I gave you two answers for the price of one question.","Henry J. Coffey - CRT Capital Group LLC","Thank you very much, sir.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just drilling down on the expenses, were there any other one-timers aside from the BSA look-back? The other expense line looked a little bit elevated and I was kind of expecting a little bit of a decline potentially from the liability shift from EMV.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I like that there was a little bit of elevated fraud cost in the fourth quarter...","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And a little EMV cost.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And a little bit of EMV cost. So I think as you continue to push the cards out, there's costs associated with that. On the flip side of the equation, I think the fraud was actually up a little bit, as you have the fraudsters trying to getting that one last hit before while swiping is still very prevalent. So I think there's a combination of both sides of the same coin that you're seeing show up in that line item.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Remember on EMV, the rollout for the industry is still in-process. There's a lot of retailers that haven't put it in, activated it yet.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, can you guys give us an update on how the Cashback Checking is progressing.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. We continue to purely offer that through cross-sell. We achieved the targets that we set internally for the product last year just with the cross-sell, and it is my hope that by year-end we will finally be able to make it available more broadly, but we continue to enhance the operations, the functionality, the controls around AML\/BSA and fraud, and we have continued to learn a lot. And I think that one of the reasons we've taken longer to launch this one than others is because it is a very important and more complicated product than typical products out there. So we want to wait to go abroad until we are all buttoned down.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. The personal loan business, the reserve was up quite a bit in personal loans and a little bit of increase in charge-offs and delinquencies. And the growth rate also continued to slow. Is it the competitive environment in personal loans? Are you incrementally concerned about credit in that business? And with the competitive environment, with the lending (1:05:52), do you expect that to at some point over the next year or so that there's going to be something that's going to derail some of those rapidly growing Internet competitors?","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll tackle the reserving question and David can tackle the strategic element of the question. I would say, Bob, what's driving it really is seasoning of the portfolio, right. I mean, I think you've seen double-digit growth rates there over the course of a number of years. Personal loans don't season radically differently than credit card loans do. There's a little bit of a change in the shape of the curve and it's not exactly the same, but they tend to season after origination. You don't get a lot of first payment defaults when you do it prudently, thankfully. So I would say it's just seasoning. Don't expect any major deterioration of any kind in that portfolio and the seasoning we are seeing is in line with expectations.","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And what I would say on the strategic side is we had record originations this year in that business, even with literally hundreds of marketplace competitors entering and vying for share. And I think that part of the reason is that the people that we're targeting tend to be very different than the credits that most of those are targeting. Our average FICO score is 750, 760. The figures I've seen from the leading companies in the marketplace space is sub-700 average. And when every 20 points of FICO means a doubling of credit losses that is a very big difference in target market. And so we think that we're still the leader in prime originations in the space.","In terms of whether there will be a shake out, I'm sure there will be a shake out. I'm sure some people will survive, but I don't think that there will be hundreds of competitors. And it is an unproven model through the cycle. And I believe that our model of originating and holding versus just an originate and sale that relies solely on growth, and if you stop originating you don't have revenue, I believe that a relationship, owning the credits, being able to finance it on our balance sheet and not having to rely on securitization markets that we have seen can completely dry up in a crisis I think is a more sustainable model. And so I really like our position in that business.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then my follow-up question, just in the spirit of trying to accelerate growth, just any thoughts on the trends in the student loan business? And then how the Ariba partnership is going and if that can be a material driver, how long does it take? Or could that business ever be a material driver of revenue growth and earnings growth?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, answering your third question, I guess, first, we think that Ariba is going to continue to produce a lot of volume growth in the short term. It will be a while before it becomes a material contributor profitability-wise. We also think there may be some ancillary services that may provide some revenues that having that product we're working on adding some additional functionality that may produce some revenue potential. On student loans, I'm not sure I fully understood your question on the student loans.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Just on the growth rate outlook for that business, do you expect to see steady trends, or is there anything you're working on to accelerate growth in the student loan business or...?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I think...","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Or are there any things that are concerning that would slow it down from a regulatory standpoint or otherwise?","David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I expect to originate more this year than we did last year. But I don't expect a dramatic acceleration, but I do think that the credit trends look great, the needs continue from customers, and I expect us to originate a bit more.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Bob, it is helpful to look at the organic book versus the acquired book, because the acquired we bought a number of years ago is essentially in run-off.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Franklin for final remarks.","Bill Franklin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us.

My name is Sandra, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bill Franklin, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Franklin, you may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Sandra. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us on this morning's call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report, in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011, and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 31, 2012, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the third quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened, we reported quarterly earnings of $627 million or $1.21 per share, driven by continued improvements in credit, robust loan growth and share repurchases. During the quarter, we generated a return on equity of 28% and returned approximately $400 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Before I further discuss our third quarter, let me first acknowledge that during the past week, we entered into a consent order with the FDIC and CFPB regarding the previously disclosed matters related to the telephone marketing practices of certain credit protection products. We agreed to provide refunds of approximately $200 million to cardholders who bought the products from December 2007 to August 2011 and to enhance our marketing practices. We will also pay an additional $14 million in civil monetary penalties. I am pleased that this settlement has been concluded. All of us at Discover are committed to doing the right thing for our customers.","Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. We achieved strong growth over the prior year as revenues were up 10% and total receivables grew 9%. Credit quality continued to improve for our card business, which, once again, realized historic lows for the over 30-day delinquency and principal charge-off rates. Another achievement during the quarter was an all-time high level of active merchants generating Discover Card sales, a direct consequence of our acceptance and awareness initiatives.","Discover year-over-year sales growth moderated somewhat over the prior quarter, in line with the movements in lower consumer confidence. August, however, was the strongest month in the quarter, and one thing I am particularly pleased with is that at a time when revolving debt for the industry is roughly flat over last year, we grew our card receivables by 4%. We also continued to grow private student and personal loans, which we expect will offer similar normalized returns to card.","In addition to growing our loan portfolio, we are executing on our strategy to be the leading direct banking and payments company with the launch of Discover Home Loans in June. Acquiring the assets of Home Loan Center from Tree.com allowed us to enter the mortgage business with a low-cost acquisition and an originate and sell model. During the first 100 days after launch, we originated approximately $1 billion in mortgages through this platform.","Our payments business continues to leverage existing assets in unique ways and build upon acceptance achievements. We have created momentum and established ourselves as a flexible partner in the evolving payments landscape. For instance, in the U.S., we will bring PayPal to the physical point-of-sale at millions of merchant locations currently accepting Discover. Over the next few quarters, we will be working hard to accommodate PayPal's launch.","On the international front, Diners Club added Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is the largest Chinese credit card issuer, as a franchisee. Also, we've recently extended our existing relationship with Russian Standard Bank, the largest Russian credit card issuer, which will now issue and promote Discover-branded cards in Russia. This is the second Discover card agreement outside of the U.S.","We are pleased with our results this quarter, particularly with the momentum we have created through our new payments and direct banking initiatives, as well as our card sales and receivables growth.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark.","R. Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments this morning by focusing on the Direct Banking segment, which earned $963 million pretax this quarter versus $1 billion last year. Net interest income increased $133 million or 11% over the prior year, driven by asset growth and a higher net interest margin, which was 18 basis points higher than the prior year at 9.44%.","Lower funding costs and lower card charge-offs more than offset asset yield compression of 33 basis points from the prior year. In terms of specifics, card interest yield declined 19 basis points from the prior year to 12.27% due to more promotional price balances, as well as a decline in higher APR balances. Additionally, total yield was further depressed by the acquisition of lower yield student loans during the fourth quarter of last year. I will remind you that while private student loans do have lower yields, they also have lower charge-offs and operating expenses.","Interest expense as a percentage of average receivables was down 47 basis points over the prior year to 2.24% due to the continued benefit from refinancing maturing liabilities at lower rates. We expect net interest margin to remain elevated through the end of the year due to slower-than-expected yield compression and continued benefits from a favorable funding environment.","Other income for the Direct Banking segment was $25 million higher than the prior year mainly due to the inclusion of revenue from Discover Home Loans, our mortgage business launched in June of this year. This product launch also added to expenses, so I would remind you of our prior commentary that we continue expect -- to expect it to remain relatively immaterial to earnings for some time.","Continuing with other income. Our rewards expense, a contra revenue item, increased to 99 basis points on card sales during the quarter. We're comfortable with this level of investment in the current environment and presently expect the rewards rate to be around 1% going forward. Another component of other income, protection product revenue, was down from last year, and as we've said previously, we expect this line item to continue to decrease over time.","Operating expenses for the Direct Banking segment were up $178 million over the prior year or 29%. This growth was due to a $94 million increase in expenses for legal reserves associated primarily with the recently concluded FDIC and CFPB settlement, along with expenses related to the Home Loan Center acquisition, higher marketing expenses and higher headcount. To put things in context for you, excluding the increase in legal reserves and the expenses associated with Discover Home Loans, operating leverage would have been flat. Excluding all nonrecurring items, we would expect expenses to increase sequentially for the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain marketing campaigns.","Private student loans, including the $2.4 billion acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year, were up $2.9 billion over the prior year. We just completed the peak student loan origination season, and we're pleased with the results. Our fixed-rate student loan product, which was launched in May, continues to receive strong interest from borrowers. Credit card loans were up $1.9 billion, and personal loans were up $675 million from the prior year.","Turning to credit. Credit card delinquency and charge-off rates were, once again, at historic lows for the quarter. The credit card 30-plus day delinquency rate declined 10 basis points and the net charge-off rate declined 36 basis points sequentially. The over 30-day delinquency rates for student loans increased 26 basis points and the net charge-off rate, excluding purchase credit impaired loans, increased 6 basis points from the second quarter. These credit metrics reflect increased seasoning of the organic portfolio. The credit performance of both our organic and the purchase credit impaired portfolios continues to be in line with our expectations.","The personal loan over 30-day delinquency rate was down 5 basis points and the net charge-off rate for personal loans was down 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in card delinquencies and the prospects for future credit performance led to a $182 million loan loss reserve release this quarter.","Turning to the Payment Services segment. Pretax profit increased 31% over the prior year to $49 million. Increases in higher margin point-of-sale volume for our PULSE PIN debit network and higher third-party issuing volume were partially offset by global acceptance- and Diners-related investments. Segment volumes were up 13% over the prior year, driven by a 17% increase in PULSE volumes and 12% growth in Discover Network third-party issuing volume. As David mentioned, we recently signed several agreements that should contribute, longer term, to volume growth.","Next, I'll touch on liquidity, funding and capital. Our on-balance-sheet liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $12.1 billion. Total available liquidity was $29 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over the prior quarter. The increase was largely driven by opportunistic securitization funding that allowed us to prefund upcoming maturities.","During July, we priced a dual-tranche ABS deal consisting of a $1 billion 7-year fixed-rate tranche, with a coupon of 1.67%; and a $650 million 3-year floating-rate tranche, priced at 1 month LIBOR plus 20 basis points. We will continue to opportunistically fund our business by tapping all of our available channels. We ended the quarter with a 13.9% Tier 1 common ratio, which was 10 basis points lower than the last quarter, as we continue to grow receivables and deploy capital.","Let me conclude with some final comments. During the quarter, we generated strong earnings through continued credit improvement in the card book, growth in loans and a higher net interest margin. The Payments business leveraged our network and acceptance footprint to enter into a key service provider relationship with PayPal. We also expanded our Direct Banking product suite by launching Discover Home Loans. And lastly, we continue to deploy capital by repurchasing over 4% of our shares in the last 2 quarters and have $1.2 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase program.","That concludes our formal remarks this morning. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Sandra, to open things up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just on payment protection, now that you've settled with the agencies and refined your practice, can you just help us how we think about that line going forward? I know you've said historically it should migrate lower. And I know that you have changed some of your practices and pulled back on marketing, so could you just give a sense how we should think about that as we look forward?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, Ryan. It's Mark. I guess what I would say is we do continue to market the products, but the best guidance I can give you at this point in time is we continue to expect that line item, as you well noted, to decline over time. We're still working through a number of things in that consent order, and until all that's finalized, it's really hard to give you more definitive outlook.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess I'll ask one follow-up. Just in terms of the margin, I think you said, Mark, that you think it's going to be elevated from now until the end of the year. But can you help us think of how we should think about the outlook as we look beyond that? I think you've said as we moved into year end, we should start to migrate towards the 9%. Any change in that outlook? I know some of the maturity is slow as we look out over the next couple of quarters, but anything beyond just the next quarter or 2?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would say we can see a path to an elevated margin beyond just the next quarter or so. I'm a little reticent to say it keeps getting better forever and ever because there can be shocks to the funding environment that change things. And at some point in time, credit will actually turn on us, and these interest charge-offs won't continue to decline at the rate they have. But at this point in time, Ryan, I guess what I would say is clearly the margin can remain elevated beyond the end of the year. Exactly how much longer, candidly, remains to be seen.","Operator","And the next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess the question I have is, one of the more significant intra-quarter items that you guys talked about earlier is the deal with PayPal. I was wondering, David, can you just talk about how we should think about this opportunity strategically for Discover and whether or not we could see more of these types of opportunities as e-wallets evolve in the marketplace. And then secondarily, just a question for Mark. You talked about the rewards expense kind of staying elevated. How should we think about that net interchange income line? I mean is that the way to look at it?","David W. Nelms","Well, Sanjay, we've been talking for quite some time about our strategy in the payments area to be the most flexible and best partner for a number of other players. And you've seen us execute that strategy with a number of foreign networks over -- ranging from the Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, to open up our network to their cardholder base and to provide full acceptance across the U.S. for them. And so one way to think about this is PayPal is entirely consistent with that. It is different because they have a huge customer base and they are very big online and they're uniquely focused and uniquely positioned. So there won't be -- I don't think there will be any deal exactly like this one because no one else is positioned as uniquely, and in some cases, as well as PayPal because, to some degree, a lot of people are talking about wallets these days and getting into it, but they've been in it a long time. They've enhanced it and they've got a huge customer base, huge volume online. We're opening up the offline to them and doing it in a way that is backward-compatible with existing terminals and future-ready for all the new technologies that will be deployed at point of sale. So I expect us to continue executing that strategy. We're very focused and excited about PayPal. But we will also continue to do different kinds of deals with multiple other parties over time.","R. Mark Graf","Sanjay, it's Mark. With respect to the rewards situation, I would say we're the leader in the cash rewards space in terms of market share, and we will continue to reinvest in our product as you might expect a leader to do to not only protect, but to enhance that position. In terms of the net interchange revenue line item that you noted, I think that's probably a pretty good way to think about things and about one of the metrics we use to look at things. I would say any of the enhancements we make, we look at the NPV of those enhancements to the products to make sure that they're in the best interest of shareholders over the long haul with all the puts and takes. And I would expect that, that 1% guidance would result in that net interchange line being roughly flat going forward. It may bounce a basis point or 2 here or there due to some fluctuations in the market or in the actual product offerings quarter-over-quarter, but that's probably a pretty good metric to keep your eye on.","Operator","And the next question is from Eric Beardsley from Barclays.","Eric Beardsley - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In terms of your loan growth outpacing the sales volume growth this quarter, what would you attribute that to? Is that just increased promotional activity? Or have you seen any changes in customer behavior?","David W. Nelms","Well, I'd say the loan and sales growth were pretty close to each other, and that is different than the last few years when, generally, sales has outpaced loan growth. I would say it could be partly a sign that the deleveraging trend that we've seen may have run its course and there may be less of a difference between sales and loan growth over time, which is not necessarily a bad thing given that most of the income in cards does come from loans versus sales. And the other thing I would say is there's a lot of things besides just sales that go into the loan growth. And as an example, this very low level of charge-off rate that we're experiencing means it helps support the loan growth beyond what it would be in a time of higher charge-offs and payment rates impact as do promotional rates balances.","Eric Beardsley - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just one follow-up. In terms of your percentage of balances that are in your default bucket and promo buckets, could you provide an update on that?","David W. Nelms","Yes. We generally do that, as you know, at investor day, and we'd expect to update it there. I would just say that our promotional balances, in total, are slightly up from the prior quarter, but not meaningfully so.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I'd say they remained well below the precrisis levels that you would have seen.","Operator","And the next question is from Don Fandetti from Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, I was wondering. The ROAs in the card business remain remarkably strong. I was just curious if you see any risk from competition in terms of the card deals around the regulatory side. We've all sort of put regulatory in a bucket that looks pretty contained.","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that there's no doubt that ROAs that we are achieving are well above what our model target is and frankly, above what most competitors, we believe, are at. And so I think over time, as both charge-offs, credit and as well as cost of funds normalize, you would expect ROAs to come back to more normal levels. That -- and certainly, the competition remains robust in the card business. I don't see a big change, getting more or less. It's a competitive business. But that being said, it doesn't appear to me that there's going to be any real near-term change, and I think that ROAs, we believe, are likely to remain elevated for, potentially, quite some time.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So you don't really see anything from the regionals or other entrants that would put pressure on yields, near term?","David W. Nelms","This is such a scaled business that it is -- I think it's hard to be competitive and offer all the services, to be cost-competitive, to provide the level of services, the product features. I think that what we see is very robust competition from the handful of players who have enough scale to be huge players in this business. And so those are the kinds of players that I'm focused on and that we run across every day in the marketplace.","Operator","And the next question is from Brad Ball from Evercore.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you talk about overall volumes? What was the driver behind the strength in PULSE? Was there a Durbin impact? Why was Diners volume a little bit weaker? And was there any FX impact to speak of this quarter?","David W. Nelms","Yes, well, I guess, doing Diners first. There was an FX impact, and certainly, some of the situations in Europe have not been helpful. And frankly, we've announced a number of new deals in China and Russia and other places that we're quite excited about, but those will take some time to bear fruit. So we -- I don't think that we're going to see a big upturn in Diners Club until some of those things really start to kick in and we get past, hopefully, some of the headwinds that we see right now. In terms of PULSE, I think that I'm just very pleased with the execution. I think it's pretty consistent with more of how PULSE has executed the last several years. Really, since we bought PULSE, they've managed to gain share in a very competitive environment. I think in terms of Durbin, it's really too early to tell exactly whether that's going to be helpful or hurtful, frankly, given some of VISA's actions that we've been on record that we're concerned about and that the DOJ is looking into.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. We also have a follow-up PayPal question from our Evercore Internet team, Andrew McNellis. I'll just hand it to him quickly.","Andrew McNellis - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","We just wanted to follow up on PayPal. Specifically, are you collecting the standard network fee on each transaction? And if so, do you see PayPal driving meaningfully more volume on the Discover Network?","David W. Nelms","We obviously wouldn't go into the details of our -- of a confidential deal. But I would say, generally, we would expect to earn revenues based on volume, just like almost any network deal one could imagine. I'd probably leave it at that.","Operator","And the next question is from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'd like to have you address a little bit more on the competition side of the equation. Obviously, today credit is quite good, and your comments are certainly suggesting that you expect it to remain that way. I guess I would like to understand if you're seeing any changes in terms of the competitive backdrop for underwriting of card balances, if you're seeing any more aggressive activity, any loosening of standards or if there's been really no meaningful change.","David W. Nelms","I would say that I haven't seen a meaningful change on the credit side. And I think in terms of the marketing budgets and marketing levels, I think it may be slightly less robust this year than it was last year, when some of the players had some significant reserve releases and it looked to me like we saw some -- just a huge recovery in direct mail volumes, as an example. And I've seen evidence that some competitors may be moderating a little bit in that. But generally, it remains robust competition, and I'm pleased that we're able to gain market share, particularly in loans, despite that competition.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just if you could reflect a little more. You've indicated that some of your partners really look at Discover as a strong domestic -- having a strong domestic merchant acceptance footprint. I guess I'd like to maybe have you discuss how you look at the global merchant acceptance footprint, where you think that needs to go in order for Discover to be really viewed as a full global competitor on that standpoint, please.","David W. Nelms","Well, we think we're #3 globally, and I think increasingly people look at us not just as a domestic but as a true global option. And while the PayPal deal starts off as a domestic deal, we're hopeful that, that will actually morph into a global acceptance deal that we certainly would be willing to offer both PayPal and others that option. We're already doing that with a lot of people. Some of those net-to-net deals that I talked about earlier, like with the Koreans or the Indian one we've done, are in fact opening up our global acceptance network. And we have made some very significant investments to strengthen our acceptance and really have made big changes in places like the U.K. or other markets. And so we're very proud of where -- our momentum, as well as our how we are viewed as a -- as really the alternative to the standard kind of deals out there globally.","Operator","And the next question is from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wonder if you could just talk for a minute about what's happening. I think you're in the market testing a new card, the Discover it Card. Just give us a sense of how that's going and what you're discovering so far in terms of customer interest.","David W. Nelms","I would say we are very pleased with our early results from Discover it. It is quite innovative and one of the most different kinds of products across all phases, not just features and service, but the look and feel of the card itself, the delivery. And I'm optimistic that we'll be in a position to consider rolling that out next year.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Should that have much of an impact on margins or I mean, the net effect on the P&L?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say the thing that we most hope is that it will have a good effect on our ability to grow accounts and ultimately, sales and receivables, more than anything.","R. Mark Graf","We are -- I just have to jump in and say we are --  obviously, we view ourselves as responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital, and we're not going to roll it out if it doesn't make economic sense to roll it out. So we are in the testing phase. It's too early to give you more specific answers to that question until we know more where this is all shaking out.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, great. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned that August sales, I guess, was the best in the quarter. Give us a sense of how September -- the first 3 weeks of September compare to August.","David W. Nelms","Yes. I would say September, so far, looks a whole lot more like August than it did the first 2 months in terms of being better year-over-year.","Operator","And the next question is from Scott Valentin from FBR Capital Markets.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","With regard to returning capital, I think you pointed out this quarter, David, that $400 million returned, about 65% of earnings. How should we think of that going forward? As a percentage of earnings, how much do you want to return to shareholders per year?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think -- this is Mark. I guess what I'd say in respect to that is just preface the comment by reminding everybody, not that you need a reminding, but I just feel I have to do it, that we now have to get any capital actions approved on an annual basis, if you will, as part of the CCAR capital process with the Federal Reserve. But with that as the backdrop, I think they have sent a pretty clear signal that 30% dividend payout ratios are kind of the maximum that they're looking at in terms of dividends. We are well below that and see meaningful room to increase our dividend over time. I would say that the repurchases would make up the remainder. We clearly don't have any intention of continuing to run at a 14% Tier 1 common ratio over the long haul. And I think we've got $1.2 billion remaining under that current repurchase authorization. I think we've kind of provided guidance earlier that we'd expect we would use over half of that $2 billion authorization over the remainder of our fiscal year. So I would say that's still probably good guidance at this point in time given where we sit right now, absent anything popping up or changing. But over the long term, as we move forward, I think we are going to continue to look for opportunities to deploy and\/or return that capital in our shareholders' best interests.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, that helps. And then just a follow-up question with regard to the comment earlier. Rewards -- I'm sorry, marketing expense generally increased with the seasonal fourth quarter. Should it be comparable in size or percentage to what we saw last year? I think last year was about an 8% increase from -- quarter-over-quarter from 3Q to 4Q. I'm just wondering is that kind of what you're thinking or is there -- do you think there's room to increase even further.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think it could be a slightly larger increase than that. I'm not prepared to give really specific numbers at this point in time, but I think it could be somewhat bigger than 8%.","Operator","And the next question is from Rick Shane from JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In going through the master trust filings, one thing we noticed over the last year is an increase both in higher line limits and also, higher FICO scores. It's enough to at least sort of call attention to. Is that going to be the intention going forward? Are you focused on that higher-end customer and\/or how do you feel about that increase in line limit availability?","David W. Nelms","I would say -- it's David -- that I'm a little surprised that you would have seen a difference in 1 quarter. I mean we did a significant securitization during this quarter, so it might have just been some movement in the trust date, as opposed to the overall portfolio as, generally, I would expect a fair amount of stability from quarter-to-quarter. And I would kind of ...","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","David, it's over an 8- or 9-month period. I didn't want to suggest it was 1 quarter, I apologize.","David W. Nelms","Okay. Well, we could follow up with you specifically on that. But I'd say just generally, we have been a prime card issuer, and we are not making any significant moves, either on credit lines or credit quality. We're always enhancing, fine-tuning. If we find prime people that we can give more lines to, we would do so, but nothing dramatic.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It may just be noise in the data then -- which is a good answer.","Bill Franklin","[indiscernible]","R. Mark Graf","Yes. Just to be abundantly clear though on that front -- thanks, Bill. I just want to remind everybody, we haven't put new accounts into the trust in a long time. So any movement you're seeing in the trust data is reflective of movement of the underlying line size or the credit quality of the folks who've already been in the trust.","Operator","And the next question is from Chris Brendler from Stifel.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. One on the domestic cash side, it looked like -- if I back into like cash volume, this quarter was the biggest quarter you've had in cash in a couple of years. I just wanted -- nothing huge, $2.5 billion or so, but just wanted to see if that was a result of increased promotional activity on your part or increased consumer uptake of balance transfer offers.","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that we are continuing to try to grow the number of new accounts that we put on and that tends to -- those tend to come with a pretty high percentage of promotional balances initially. So I think it'd probably be mainly reflective of that.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Any improvement in consumer demand from your perspective, David?","David W. Nelms","I would say a lot of consistency on consumer demand, not seeing big movements one way or another.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my final question would be, on the student lending side, delinquencies ticked up pretty meaningfully this quarter. I just don't know how I should look at this number. What -- where do we sort of see it's heading on a fully seasoned basis. I know this portfolio is relatively new. Just give me some parameters to help us think about delinquency rate in the student loan portfolio.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would -- this is Mark. I'd point you back to our investor day materials in terms of how we expect that business to perform over the long haul. What you're seeing in the student book specifically is -- the organic student book specifically is the maturation of that portfolio as the loans begin to be coming to the repayment phase. There's also some seasonality going on there because as graduates come out of the deferral process and go into repayment is when you start to see delinquency get reflected a little bit. But all of this is consistent with the way we've modeled the behavior internally in terms of giving a long-term guidance on the way that book is going to perform. So I'd direct you back toward that to really think through how you could model this over the long haul.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. Do you think [indiscernible] in line with expectations on your part? Or is it a little ahead, a little behind? Where are we [indiscernible] can you help us think on your perspective?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, the statistics you're referring to are on the organic student loan book specifically, and they are in line with our expectations.","Operator","And the next question is from Matt O'Neill from CLSA.","Matthew O'Neill - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was hoping we could just quickly come back to the PayPal questions. And what I was really looking to get at was, do you think PayPal is primarily focused on the opportunity to sell additional services to merchants versus the pure per-transaction economics as their true revenue opportunity?","David W. Nelms","Well, you'd have to ask PayPal their objectives precisely. But I can say our part in it is to open up our acceptance network and assets to what is a -- has become a very significant customer base that they have developed over time.","Operator","And the next question is from Daniel Furtado from Jefferies.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This should be relatively straightforward. The other income increase in the quarter, my assumption is that was mortgage. I just wanted to get a confirmation there. And then the second piece is, generally speaking, what has the ramp been on the mortgage origination side? And I get it that gain on sale margins will have an impact, but generally speaking, what level of originations do you think you need to achieve in order to get past this break-even stage in that business?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would -- your assessment is indeed correct. The vast majority of the increase in other income was related to the introduction of the Discover Home Loans to the marketplace this quarter. I would tell you, again, as we come up the curve in the business and given our usual prudent approach to things, we're not going to jam the pedal to the floorboards anytime soon to try and dominate the industry in the next 3 months. But I would say -- if you wanted just a little peek under the tent, I would say that the business was net contributory this past quarter, but not by very much.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And -- but there's no necessary -- well, I guess you've already gone through that. How about the ramp on the originations, has there been any material move there since onboarding the business?","David W. Nelms","Well, as I mentioned, we did about $1 billion in the first 100 days. I think it's too early to talk about a ramp. We -- this was the first quarter. And I would say that obviously, refinance volumes, in particular, are extremely robust, and the business is benefiting from that. I think the important thing for us to get to improve our profitability is actually more on the cost side. There's obviously a good number of integration expenses. We are changing the marketing from -- to much more cross-selling and using the Discover brand versus lead management. And it will take quite some time to get the cost structure down, independent of volume production and that's what we'll tend to -- that's what we're mainly focused on in terms of profitability.","Operator","And the next question is from Mike Taiano from Telsey Advisory Group.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Two unrelated questions. I guess first on the net interest margin expansion. Mark, could you maybe give us a sense of how much of the improvement was a function of lower charge-offs? And then secondly, on the PayPal relationship, could you give us a sense of whether those transactions on the offline world will be billed as card-not-present transactions and carry a higher interchange fee for the merchant?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. On the net interest margin side of the equation, clearly, I would say a part of it is due to the lower net interest charge-offs. I would say funding is driving a bigger piece.","David W. Nelms","Yes, and Mike, you can see the net interest and fee charge-offs in the supplement now. We pegged that a few quarters ago, so you can kind of see the decrease.","R. Mark Graf","And then in terms of PayPal, you would -- PayPal will be setting their pricing, and I'm not sure you should even think about it as comparison with something else. I mean, it is going to be PayPal pricing. So my guess is they're not going to be disclosing that until next year at launch, but you could ask them.","Operator","And the next question is from Henry Coffey from Sterne Agee.","Henry J. Coffey - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Focusing back on the mortgage business, how should we really think about this? Is it going to be an adjunct to the Discover card relationship like a traditional bank looks at its mortgage business? Or are you exploring new sort of more dynamic ways to access that market? And then just a sort of a second related question, as you look at the processing challenges, which is a nice way of calling the reps and warranty risk, how have you been able to manage those issues to make sure that every I is dotted and T is crossed, et cetera?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say that especially early on, we would expect a fair amount of the business to be cross-sell. We have -- about 1\/4 of the U.S. households have a Discover card, a Discover relationship, and so that would be the natural place to start to deliver the same kind of value and service to the mortgage origination business as we've done elsewhere. And I would think about it not as an -- not so much as an adjunct to the card, but as an important pillar in our direct banking strategy. Mortgages are obviously the largest single consumer loan that -- category. And so as we continue on our journey to be the best direct bank, mortgages, along with credit cards and other products, will be important to fulfilling that vision of extending the Discover brand and capabilities to these other products. In terms of dotting the Is, crossing the Ts, controls and having modest growth aspirations is very important. Obviously, we looked for 2 years-plus before we pulled the trigger on this particular acquisition, and what we liked was the operation and the foundation on which to build. And that was critically important to us to make sure that everything was second to none in the industry in terms of doing everything by the book.","Henry J. Coffey - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Now just kind of a related question, the launch of the full bank. When I can turn on my computer and have everything I'd get from some of the other major banks. Is that going to be a sort of a gradual process? Or will we sort of see a big jump forward in marketing and sort of a major product launch?","David W. Nelms","I think it will be a gradual. I mean, if you look at -- if you go to discover.com now, what you see is we've added mortgages, we've got student loans, personal loans, credit cards, money markets and CDs with the bank. And so as we've added each product, we've been expanding the banking suite, if you will, and I think what we've been really pleased with is the fact that while we're still mostly known as a credit card, it's starting to shift. Consumers increasingly are realizing that Discover can actually save them money and provide better value on a whole range of banking products, and so we're going to continue that journey.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call.

My name is Larissa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin. Mr. Franklin, you may begin.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Larissa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's call. Let me begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2011, which is on file with the SEC.","In the second quarter 2012 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at discoverfinancial.com and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer; and of course, a question-and-answer session. I would encourage you that it would be helpful to limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before the market opened this morning, we reported quarterly earnings of $537 million or an even $1 per diluted share, driven by 6% year-over-year increase in revenues and continued improvements in credit.","Additionally, we returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders with combined share buybacks and dividends of approximately $500 million in the quarter.","In Direct Banking, we continued to deliver strong growth in card, private student and personal loans and launched some new products for future growth. I'm very pleased with our total loan growth of 9% over the prior year, which reflects another quarter of nearly 4% growth in card loans as we continue to focus on profitable revolver sales through cash rewards leadership, promotional offers, partnerships and advertising.","We continue to achieve strong receivables growth while the overall card industry remains relatively flat. In terms of credit card performance, the strength of our risk management capabilities and the quality of our portfolio resulted in new historic lows for the 30-plus delinquency and net charge-off rates.","The 30-plus delinquency rate fell below 2%, and our 90-plus delinquency rate fell to below 1%. This is truly outstanding credit performance.","Also, in card, we recently announced our first affinity partnership with Ducks Unlimited, the largest conservation group in the world with more than 600,000 adult members committed to wetlands and waterfowl conservation. This partnership will leverage our leading rewards program and be a nice addition for new account and sales growth.","In student loans, we started offering a new fixed-rate private student loan product. This new fixed-rate loan product provides predictability with a set interest rate for the life of the loan. Discover's fixed-rate private student loans are designed to have rates comparable to federal unsubsidized Stafford and PLUS Loans for qualifying students without the upfront origination fees of up to 4%. It is too early to tell how much long-term growth will come from this offering as it has been in the market for less than a month, but the early signs from customers and school financial aid officers are positive.","The third new product that we just started marketing is residential mortgages under the Discover Home Loans brand. On June 6, we start -- we closed on the acquisition of the Home Loan Center business from Tree.com. The platform we acquired had a seasoned -- has a seasoned management team, approximately 750 employees and a technology platform that gives us room to expand in the future.","We are originating prime, fixed- and variable-rate, conventional and FHA loans, which will be sold to the secondary market with servicing released. Home Loans is a product our customers have been asking Discover for, and the mortgage business is a natural extension of our Direct Banking strategy.","We are entering this market in a sensible way, having acquired a platform at low-cost without the complexities of MSRs or legacy assets. After we launch the checking product later this year, I believe we will have achieved another key milestone toward building a full suite of Direct Banking products.","In Payments, PULSE growth was up 14% over the prior year to an all-time record of $42 billion. As we have discussed previously, PULSE added 129 new relationships in 2011. However, merchant and acquirer routing discussions are still in process, and competitors' pricing changes are still being implemented in the market.","We continue to remain concerned about one competitor's actions in the market, but that being said, I am pleased with how our PULSE team has responded. In summary, credit performance continues to be exceptional, but we continue to expect that we must be at or near the bottom. We are launching new products which will position us for revenue and asset growth in the future, and we are deploying capital in a thoughtful, meaningful way.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review our second quarter results.","R. Mark Graf","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments by focusing on our Direct Banking segment's second quarter results. The segment earned $820 million pretax this quarter versus $883 million last year. Yield on the card portfolio declined 22 basis points from the prior year to 12.35%. We continue to see our APR mix move away from higher APR balances but at a slower pace than we expected. And our promotional volumes increased over the prior year.","These were partially offset by lower interest charge-offs. Sequentially, card yield increased 14 basis points as we saw higher revolve rate in our merchandise balances and as we continue to benefit from lower accrued interest charge-offs.","Total portfolio yield was 11.55%, lower by 38 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year, driven primarily by the acquisition of the additional private student loan portfolio in the fourth quarter, as well as the current yield compression that I just mentioned. I'll remind you that while private student loans have lower yields than cards and personal loans, they also have lower charge-off rates and operating expenses.","The yield compression was slightly offset by the sale of our remaining federal student loans in the first quarter of this year.","Net interest income increased $122 million or 10% versus the prior year, driven by asset growth, the benefit of lower interest expense on our funding and lower charge-offs of accrued interest. Net interest margin on receivables was up 16 basis points to 9.31% compared to the prior year due to lower charge-offs of accrued interest and continued funding cost improvement. In fact, funding costs are down 50 basis points versus the prior year to 2.41% as a percentage of average receivables. This was partially offset by card yield compression and growth in lower-yielding private student loans.","The sequential increase in net interest margin of 28 basis points was primarily driven by yield expansion across all assets and lower funding costs. We expect the net interest margin to stabilize around the current level for the remainder of the year, primarily as result of card yield holding up better than expected.","Other income for the Direct Banking segment decreased $21 million from last year's second quarter as a result of lower late fees, lower transition services revenue related to the Student Loan Corporation and a decline in protection products revenue. The largest component of other income, discount and interchange revenue, was up compared to the prior year, but offset by higher rewards as we modestly increased our rewards rate on card sales to 95 basis points.","Rewards should be in this area for the remainder of the year as we continue to invest in our program to drive profitable sales growth and feel this is the right level in this environment.","Total operating expenses for the segment were up $108 million from the prior year or 18%. This growth was primarily due to a $71 million increase in legal reserve expenses over the prior year as we added $90 million to the reserve in the quarter. Excluding the increase in legal reserve expenses, operating expenses would have been up 6% compared to the prior year, which was essentially in line with revenue growth and would imply flat operating leverage.","For the second half of the year, we do expect marketing and business development expenses to increase relating to the timing of some marketing campaigns. The acquisition of the Home Loan Center platform and launch of Discover Home Loans will also raise operating expenses by about $35 million a quarter. But with the new product launch, there will also be fee revenue.","Now I'll switch to lending product growth and credit performance for the segment. We achieved card sales growth of 5% for the second quarter versus the prior year. The growth in card sales was driven by our continued focus on increasing our merchant acceptance, enriching our rewards programs and leveraging our marketing investments. Lower year-over-year increases in gas prices, as well as more difficult comps resulted in slightly lower card sales growth than in the prior quarter year-over-year increase.","Our total loan portfolio grew $4.5 billion, with $2.4 billion of this growth attributable to the accretive private student loan acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. Credit card loans were up $1.6 billion and personal loan receivables were up $703 million from the prior year.","Turning to card credit quality, our positive momentum continued this quarter as the net charge-off rate declined 28 basis points versus the prior quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate declined 31 basis points sequentially. The card reserve rate decreased 32 basis points as well, which resulted in a $122 million card reserve release. In private student loans, the net principal charge-off rate, excluding our purchased portfolios, was 67 basis points. The charge-offs in delinquencies in our private student loan portfolio are performing according to our expectations and will continue to rise slightly as the portfolio seasons.","In terms of personal loan credit performance, loans greater than 30 days past due fell 2 basis points sequentially. And the personal loan net principal charge-off rate was down 35 basis points. The improvement can be attributed to portfolio growth and risk initiatives. We continue to focus on thoughtful, measured growth in this asset class by leveraging our established underwriting competencies.","Shifting to the Payment side, we had another quarter of strong pretax earnings and Payment volumes. Pretax income was up $4 million, or 10% from the prior year, to $47 million, driven by higher-margin point-of-sale volume from our PULSE PIN debit network business and third-party issuing volume. Higher contra revenues had an offsetting impact as incentives paid for transaction routing preference increased from the prior year. Volumes were up 12% against the prior year, driven by 14% growth in PULSE and 19% growth in our Discover Network third-party issuing volumes, offset partly by Diners Club performance.","Let's move on to liquidity, funding and capital. Our liquidity levels remain strong, with total available liquidity of $27.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Our on balance sheet liquidity portfolio ended the quarter at $11.3 billion, up $2.6 billion from the prior year but down from the end of the first quarter. As you may recall, at the end of the first quarter, we had prefunded a large volume of second quarter maturities. While direct-to-consumer deposits continue to be our largest source of funding, we remain opportunistic across all of our funding channels. During the quarter, we completed an unsecured debt exchange through which we traded approximately 80% or $322 million of our 10.25% senior notes due in 2019 for a new 5.2% senior notes due in 2022. While the exchange offer had a slightly negative impact on results for the quarter, it will deliver a pretax benefit of approximately $8 million per year over the coming years.","Additionally, we completed a 2-tranche ABS transaction after the quarter closed. The deal included a 3-year, $800 million tranche priced at a fixed coupon of 86 basis points and a $650 million 5-year floating rate tranche priced at one month LIBOR plus 37 basis points.","Turning to capital, we ended the quarter with a 14% Tier 1 common ratio, slightly lower than last quarter as we repurchased nearly $450 million worth of shares in the quarter. These buybacks included the completion of our previously disclosed $250 million accelerated share repurchase program.","With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. In the second quarter, credit improvement and strong revenue growth, paired with controlled operating expense growth, generated strong earnings. We are continuing to invest in our business through new products and global acceptance and believe these investments position us well for the future. We're continuing to return capital to shareholders with more than 2% of our shares repurchased last quarter and a $0.10 per share dividend which we've committed to revisit at least annually. Before opening up to questions, I want to take a moment to formally announce and congratulate Bill Franklin on his recent promotion to Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. I think most of you had the chance to interact with Bill, as he's been a key part of our IR team over the past several years. His knowledge of the company and the function made him a logical choice to take the helm of our program.","That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to the operator to open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW is online with a question.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So I have 2 questions. I'm going to ask them upfront. So first one, this is the third straight quarter where I think you guys took this charge for legal. I assume it was largely PPI-related, but could you just talk about where we are in the investigation and if we should expect additional impacts in the future? And then secondarily, on capital management, just on the share buyback, the roughly $450 million that you guys repurchased this quarter, is that a good quarterly run rate to expect in the future or was part of this quarter's accelerated purchase related to last quarter? And then maybe could you just talk about the M&A pipeline as well.","R. Mark Graf","Sure. There was a bunch in there, Sanjay, but I'll be happy to tackle it here and I'll let David drop in too on the M&A pipeline probably. But with respect to the legal reserve matter, I think the matter is not resolved. We are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the CFPB and the FDIC, and we hope we can resolve it soon. It's a constructive dialogue. We obviously reserve in accordance with GAAP, and the reserve is set based on probable and estimable loss contingencies. So I think beyond that, I'd just point you to the back of the disclosures in our first quarter 10-Q as they contain a pretty fulsome discussion of the significant matters. But given that it's an ongoing investigation, that's really about all we can say. With respect to the buybacks, I would say that there -- the $450 million probably included a little bit of catch-up activity from being dark in the market in the first quarter while we went through the capital planning process. I'd still remain pretty confident in my guidance, but over the course of fiscal 2012, we'll probably use a little bit north of half of that authorization is probably the right way to think about it. So that should give you some sense in terms of how to think about sizing, what our thoughts are right now. That's obviously our current thought. That's subject to change from time to time, but that's kind of how we're looking at it at this point in time. And on the M&A pipeline, David, do you want to specifically comment there?","David W. Nelms","Sure. Well, I'd say first off, obviously, we're pleased to have just closed our Home Loan acquisition, and so our primary focus will be integrating and growing that acquisition. And we remain open to other opportunities that fit our Direct Banking and Payment strategy and work financially. But we obviously have been very selective and careful but would remain open to future opportunities. I can't really comment any further on M&A pipeline per se.","R. Mark Graf","The only other thing I would type onto that one is, because I know it's important to all of you, I get asked regularly how we look at return hurdles when it comes to M&A transactions, and obviously, we do hold them up to a higher standard because of the risk embedded in any M&A-type transaction. So I'd just add that to David's comments.","Operator","Craig Maurer is online from CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","My questions revolve around, one, David's comments around one competitor's actions in the market when referring to network activity. I'm assuming that's Visa, and if you could be a little bit more specific about what their actions are that you're seeing and what's concerning you. And secondly, we heard comments on the NIM through 2012, but when looking out toward next year, should we start to see the lower-yielding loans start to catch up with the NIM?","David W. Nelms","Well, I'll address the first one. I mean, obviously, in debit, one competitor represents 70% of the market share. So when one -- when a 70% market share competitor makes moves tying products together and launching a fixed-variable pricing designed to take advantage of that 70% market share, we become -- we and many others in the industry become concerned about having a level playing field. Having a level playing field, I'm very confident in PULSE's ability to compete and bring choice and good financial performance for our financial institution customers, as well as our merchants. But obviously, there's a Department of Justice has launched an investigation, so we're not the only ones who have some concerns. Mark?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, on the net interest margin side of the equation, I would still say, over the longer term, the right way to think about a normalized margin for us is in that 8.5% to 9% range. I think we've proven that we are not adept at forecasting the compression and the current yields in that higher-rate bucket that we have out there at this point in time. So as that is taking longer, I think it will take longer to reach that normalized range. That having been said, as we move into next year, Craig, I do expect we'll start migrating down toward the high end of that range.","Operator","Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs is online with a question.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just, Mark, in terms of the credit, I know you've talked about the losses bouncing around the bottom and David commented that losses are at or near the bottom. But just sort of I looked at your early stage delinquencies, they're down almost 20% the past 5 months. And I know some of that is seasonal, but is it fair to say that we could actually see losses come down from here just given where we are on the delinquency trends?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, Ryan, I mean, I think it's plausible that, that could happen. I think, as I've said several times, one of the challenges we have, obviously, is we're in a tail environment having just come through what we've come through. And so everybody's models are a little bit less predictive than they otherwise might be. So I would suggest that it feels like we must be approaching a bottom somewhere in here. Could it possibly improve? It could. Could it possibly flatten out? It could. Our operation of math on the delinquency side of the equation would lead a logical person to kind of the conclusion you're making. But that notwithstanding, we do see some absolute limits to how low these things can go. So we tend to think about being somewhere near the bottom in the improvement. We still think we'll return to growth at some point in time over, let's say, now the next 9 months in the reserve. That growth being driven though not by a turn in the credit environment, that growth being driven simply by loan growth. So provision for growth being the key issue there. So I still think it's likely we -- when we hit a bottom, we don't bounce off in a V. I think it's more likely bouncing along the bottom for a while.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on Sanjay's question on the buyback. You did almost 25% of your authorization, the 2-year authorization in one quarter. Are there any restrictions in terms of the amount that you could actually buy back within -- into the one-year time frame? I know some others have commented on that specific to Fed guidelines. And also in terms of the 9.5% capital target, and this is the first quarter we actually saw the Tier 1 common actually come down, and I know, Mark, you've commented not wanting to see it grow further. So can we read across that this is actually the start of you guys shoring it down, maybe you get a little bit more aggressive on as we move throughout the year?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would say with respect to restrictions, I'd point you back to my commentary about using probably a little bit more than half over the course of this year of that authorization. And you should assume that our capital plan submission to the Fed allows us to act in a manner compliant with that guidance. So that would be the general thought process I'd have you think about there. The other thing I would say in response to managing accretion going forward, I think yes, the right way to think about this very much is that I think we returned a little bit north of 90% roughly in terms of total payout this quarter, which I think is pretty high. Clearly, the goal at this point in time while we're in this period of, obviously, very strong earnings, at the very least, mitigate further accretion on that capital line. So I think you should expect to see us act in that basis if not begin to draw down a little bit.","Operator","Moshe Orenbuch from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse is online with a question.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I guess the other way you could affect that capital ratio is by growing faster. Could you talk a little bit -- you alluded to the Ducks Unlimited program. And talk about the things that you're doing to kind of grow the receivables in an organic fashion a little faster. And I've got a follow-up question also.","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say, if you look at our overall 9% year-over-year loan growth, I think we're near the top of the class in terms of being able to achieve growth, and you've seen us do that through a combination of some M&A with particularly, student loans, as well as organic, both in credit card loans growing 4% organically, as well as personal loans growing nicely organically. So we've got a whole host of actions that we've been employing in terms of marketing programs, emphasizing Cashback Bonus, leveraging our newfound capabilities in student loans and our expanded capabilities in student loans, and really having some what I consider to be some good advertising and marketing programs, plus our great service. Going forward, I mentioned 3 new product areas that each, I think, have an opportunity to continue and in some cases, maybe accelerate our growth, ranging from the first affinity program, which we think will be a good opportunity in cards. That space, that affinity space, has changed dramatically in the last few years. Service is critically important to groups and group members, and so we think we're well positioned to help address that marketplace. So the fixed-loan product in student loans is designed to help us accelerate growth in that area and meet some new needs. And obviously, Home Loans won't be growing receivables, but over the long term, should grow our fee income. So we are continuing to diversify across our Direct Banking and Payment strategy in an effort to grow. We've got obviously -- we'd love to be able to invest more capital in organic growth.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just as a follow-up, you had mentioned, Mark, a $35 million kind of expense level for the mortgage business in the next quarter. How long will it take for the revenues to kind of meet or exceed that level?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think the right way to think about it, Moshe, is that it's going to be not meaningful either in terms of detracting or contributing to the overall profitability of the company in the near term. So think about it as a breakeven kind of operation is the right way to look about -- is the right way to think about it.","Operator","Scott Valentin from FBR Capital Markets is online with a question.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just on the marketing expense, you mentioned it's going to increase going forward as you have some, I guess, some activities planned. Would the rate of increase be consistent with last year? And then just overall, a follow-up question to that, just the overall operating expenses. You mentioned the operating leverage this quarter. Do you expect to continue positive operating leverage going forward?","R. Mark Graf","I would say the marketing expenses, yes, probably the right way to think about it is somewhat in line with the seasonality that you would have seen in the prior years. And in terms of -- maybe a little bit higher. But in terms of the operating leverage, I would say right now, continue to see that being essentially flattish over the course of the year is the right way to think about it as some of the investments we've made over the course of the last year begin to ramp up. And I think we've made meaningful progress against what were some pretty significant negative operating leverage over the course of the last year.","Operator","Don Fandetti from Citigroup is online with a question.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, Mark, obviously, on your mortgage initiative, it's going to be pretty modest initially. But if you sort of hit this $30 billion aspirational number of originations down the road, can you just sort of help us think about the level of capital that, that business requires? I know you only hold the loans for sort of 15 to 30 days. But I would assume at that type of origination level, you'd have a couple billion dollars of debt at the end of any given quarter. And how do you think about equity capital against that business?","R. Mark Graf","David, I'll let you address the vision for the business, and I'll tackle the GAAP. How about that?","David W. Nelms","Yes, well, I think that we cited probably the leader in direct mortgage originations who has been originating north of $30 billion a year. And given our brand, customer base and service capabilities, we think it's not unreasonable that eventually we get there. But that being said, we've bought a platform. We're going to have very measured growth here, and so I would be expecting us to reach anywhere near that level of originations in the near term. In terms of capital, it's not a particularly capital-intensive business. One reason we like it is it's a high source of fee income. But anything you'd like to add on that, Mark?","R. Mark Graf","No, I think you're thinking about it the right way. The goal is to clean out the warehouse about every 15 days or so, give or take. The platform originated $3 billion of volume in 2011. So that's kind of the run rate that's coming onto the books, if you will, if you want to think about it, or somewhere in that general neck of the woods. And obviously, cleaning out that warehouse on a 15-day basis does not result in us having any significant capital side up in that business at any point in time. And the $30 billion is aspirational.","Operator","Mark DeVries from Barclays is online with a question.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, my question is around what's priced into the card reserve here. As I look at that, the 3.68% reserve rate, but with the charge-offs below 2.8% and delinquencies down 30 basis points this quarter, which points to lower charge-offs the next quarter or 2, it would seem to me like that rate is too high. Can you just kind of talk about sort of back half of -- or the early part of next year, what your expectations are for charge-offs that would lead to such a high reserve rate?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I mean, I think it's kind of hard, obviously, to get you the right answer there because the data that you've got available to you is all historical backward-looking data, but our reserves are set on a prospective basis based on what we see happening. And again, a big part of that reserves is reserves not for charge-offs; a big part of that reserve is reserve for growth that we expect to see coming onto the books here over the course of the near-term as well. So there's a number of different moving pieces there. So what I would say is that, again, we don't expect the increase in reserves that we expect to see over that 12-month forward period coming as much from losses. We don't expect to see it coming from losses. We really expect to see more of it coming from growth in the book.","David W. Nelms","And with respect to the current reserve, it obviously reflects what we expect in charge-offs from loans that are currently on the books. And as Mark's mentioned, we feel like we're somewhere near the bottom, and so would be forecasting a modest increase in charge-offs over the forward 12-month period, which is why we end up with a -- what you see is a -- might be is a higher coverage ratio on the current quarter. It's a very low level of loan losses.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And any kind of colors on what type of growth is reflected on that? Because we're still talking about a pretty big delta between where the charge-offs are now and where the reserves are.","David W. Nelms","Well, I would just say that it assumes -- as we look at all the variables, and there's a lot, there's obviously different reserves for different parts of the books, so it's a complicated calculation, obviously, that we work very hard to fine-tune, but reflects what I would characterize is over the 12 -- forward 12 months, a modest increase in charge-off rate.","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I would think about the growth being in line really with the model we shared at Investor Day for each of the various and sundry different asset classes.","Operator","Rick Shane from JPMorgan is online with a question.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A lot going on. Hey, Mark, just one quick question for you. You had talked about the increase on delinquencies on the student loan book being a function of seasoning, and it's a little bit out of whack with what you would expect from a seasonality perspective. Can you -- you also made the comment that you see this is in line with your overall projections. Can you help us understand how long you think that seasoning will go on so that we can have a sense and benchmark this to see how things are going as well?","R. Mark Graf","Yes. I would say the comment really reflects the fact that we've had a significant portion of our portfolio that has been in the deferral phase, where the student has still been in school or immediately out of school, where they have not yet begun repayment. So obviously, during that period of time, they can't by definition be delinquent. So what happens is you have a larger portion of your book begin to creep into that repayment phase is when you start to see the delinquencies begin to materialize. And I think the right way to think about it is we continue to believe this business operates kind of right at or above sort of, give or take, a 1% loss rate annualized going forward, is the right way to think about it. And the delinquencies would be commensurate with that type of a loss rate. So -- but we can give you some more color going forward on exactly how we kind of expect that trajectory to blend out.","Operator","Robert Napoli from William Blair & Company is online with a question.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Two questions. First, just a little more color on the spend growth through the quarter and thoughts on spend growth. I mean, your spend growth on cards for the proprietary portfolio, about 5%, which, I mean you had tougher comps. But it's about in line with portfolio growth at 4%. Do you expect spend growth to track along with portfolio growth from here?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would expect spend growth to continue to be a bit more than loan growth. We've seen that in normal periods for quite some period of time. And I think that since we really started getting what I'd consider tougher comparable year-over-year comparisons probably in December of this year, and since December, I've seen a fair amount of stability bouncing around in that -- right around the 5% to 6% year-over-year if you look at the months since December. So I generally expect that kind of growth level to roughly continue.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then on your affinity, on your discussions on affinity, David, I think that's --  I mean you have some background in the affinity business with MBNA. MBNA was a massive affinity player and it's probably a shadow -- I mean, it is a shadow of what it used to be. And I mean, do you see a big opportunity here to -- in the market to really recreate the MBNA strategy of sorts? Or I mean, is this a big effort for Discover to move in that direction?","David W. Nelms","I would view it as not our primary strategy but an extension of our strategy. Certainly, one of things that we really have is our own brand, Discover, where we're the leader in Cashback Bonus. That will continue to be our primary strategy. I think that over the last few years, we have gotten an increasing interest in demand from groups who are not currently satisfied with their current providers, whoever that might be. And I think we have now stuck our toe in the water with Ducks Unlimited. We're going to focus on doing a great job with them. And I wouldn't look to have anything overall. We're not -- this is not a change in our strategy in any way, but rather a natural extension. And like most of our -- like our other efforts, we will have controlled -- test and control and grow things as appropriate based on what we learn. So there's no target to sign a whole bunch of new affinity groups over the next quarter or anything like that.","Operator","Daniel Furtado from Jefferies & Company is online with a question.","Martin Kemnec - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Martin Kemnec in for Dan Furtado. I have 2 questions. First, I think you noted in your prepared comments that promotional volumes increased over the prior year, but the APR mix is shifting away from higher balances at a slower pace. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how that mix now -- or how does that mix look now between the 3 balance types? And what would you consider kind of a normalized mix?","David W. Nelms","Yes, I think one of the statistics we've given is what percentage of balances are at a promotional rate. And it may be slightly higher this quarter at right around 16% or so but has pretty much remained about in the range that we talked about at Investor Day. And I think certainly, the fact that we've had low attrition and low charge-off rates is contributing to our yield remaining higher than one otherwise might have expected.","Martin Kemnec - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question. I think it's well-known you guys have pretty significant benefits to funding costs as these kind of higher-priced deposits are repriced. I'm just curious, how do you think about pricing 12 to 18 months out? It's like Barclays and some others are beginning to reengage the online market here in the U.S. I think also back in Investor Day, you had a chart that kind of showed how your deposits costs were tracking versus the largest banks. How -- what is that delta at today if you can describe it? Or what's the kind of convergence we should expect to see there between those 2 lines?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I guess I would say at this point in time, we tend to think about our direct-to-consumer deposits as one of our core funding channels, and it's one that brings us the added benefit of a customer attached to it as well. So having good-quality sticky funding relationships, sticky customer relationships associated with that is a real core strength. And that's really what we're focusing our action and activity in that market right now. We obviously grew the business as a pretty significant ratepayer. I would say we've gotten very disciplined in that at this point in time and still are looking to be a leader in that regard, and are very focused on that, but some of the other funding channels have of late been a little too enticing to ignore, shall we say, as well. Going forward, I would say you should expect to see us stay very competitive in the rates business. And I would expect to see that -- expect that we're monitoring all of those competitive actions you alluded to very, very carefully and feel very confident in our ability to respond to them should and if it become necessary.","Operator","James Friedman from Susquehanna Financial is online with a question.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I had 2 questions, first more of a housekeeping nature. So the rewards are up to 95 basis points from 92. Mark, could you just repeat what you had said in your prepared comments? Is that the level we should think about going forward?","R. Mark Graf","Yes, I think that 95 basis point kind of range is really the right way to think about it. In the current competitive environment, we feel strongly that reinvesting in that program and -- is a critical component of our business strategy, and that's how I think about it. I would tell you on a net available interchange basis, we're kind of flattish. So we think that, that's -- that, that rewards rate is paying off for us, shall we say. So that's what I would guide you to there.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And I know it's a small part of the business, but I wanted to ask about third-party issuance. It was up about 19%. That was the fastest growth we'd seen in many years. Could you talk a little bit about the economics of that business and if that will continue to be a focus area for the company?","David W. Nelms","Well, I would say we were very pleased with the third-party growth. And that business has been profitable for us for quite some time. We don't separately break it out, but it is certainly a contributor towards our Payment segment, and we are very interested in continuing to grow it. And I think that certainly, we've got some significant relationships in there, but we're continuing to diversify out as well with some additional relationships that are also contributing to the growth.","Operator","Matthew Howlett from Macquarie is online with a question.","Matthew Howlett - Macquarie Research","Just on the FICO score breakout, I guess the first question, has there been any change in terms of -- what you're seeing in terms of the FICO band that you're putting on? And as that relates to that question, some of your competitors have talked about going down the FICO score level. I mean, it depends on what you define subprime as, but apparently, there's a lot of opportunities in that underserved market. My question is, is there any plans to sort of reach down to some of the lower credit quality borrowers out there?","David W. Nelms","We have no intention of becoming a subprime player. We are a prime card issuer. We are -- we do continuously fine-tune our credit models and strategies. And the thing that we most look for are people that will have prime performance and that we can be profitable with. And sometimes FICO, I would say first on FICO, we have been relatively stable. So you haven't seen a big change on us. But I think sometimes, people overuse the FICO definition. We turn down a whole lot of people that are over 660 who may have other characteristics that we don't think will lend to the credit performance that the FICO score loan might indicate. And then there was a small subset of people who have less than a 660 but have other characteristics that we think can be attractive from a credit performance. So we are continuously fine-tuning our models.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Bill Franklin","All right. Thank you, Larissa.

My name is Thedra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2019 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Craig Streem","Sure. Thank you, Thedra, and welcome, everyone, to our call this evening. We'll begin on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K filing and in our 2018 10-K, both of which are on the website and again, on file with the SEC.","Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, covering first quarter highlights, and then Mark Graf, our CFO will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And after Mark completes his comments, as always, we'll have ample time for Q&A. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up during that period, so we can make sure that everyone has an opportunity.","And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Hochschild","Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. As you can see from our numbers, this was a very clean, solid quarter for Discover, reflecting continued execution on the key drivers of the business.","We're in $726 million after-tax in the quarter or $2.15 per share, and generated a very healthy ROE of 26%. As always, our principal use of capital is to support profitable growth, but in the first quarter, we also returned just over $600 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, bringing the reduction in the level of outstanding shares to 7% from a year ago.","Our emphasis on profitable growth means that we always look to achieve a balance amongst receivables growth, net interest margin, credit and operating expenses. And our performance this quarter demonstrates, how that approach continues to generate very strong returns.","Total receivables grew 7%, with each major product performing as expected. And NIM came in at a very robust level, keeping us on track to hit our full year target for that important measure. Credit performance remains solid as the normalization impact on the back book continues to lessen and operating expenses were also consistent with our expectations, leading to a 50 basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio from last year's first quarter.","As I said a moment ago, it's all about executing on fundamentals and striving for excellence in everything we do. Let's take a look at how that played out, for each of our principal products.","In card, we saw strong receivables growth as we leveraged the opportunity provided my last year\u2019s significant new account growth. We also continue to drive a high level of engagement from our customer's, which is reflected in our increased sales volume. Year-over-year, we invested a bit more in brand advertising, while account acquisition spend was basically flat.","From an earnings point of view, slower growth in card marketing costs, somewhat offset the higher rewards costs from this quarter's grocery category. Our private student loans business turned in another very strong quarter, with organic receivables growth 9% and further improvement in credit performance.","In personal loans, our portfolio grew 2%, consistent with the outlook we shared with you. We continue to focus on originating loans that we expect will generate the appropriate level of long-term returns as opposed to simply targeting a higher level of growth and what continues to be very competitive environment. As expected, charge-offs were off in personal loans, principally driven by earlier vintages. Newer vintages are performing well, and we're seeing positive results from our revised underwriting strategy.","Our Payment Services segment generated 9% growth in volume, largely due to the performance of PULSE. The PULSE team has been successful at winning new relationships and building businesses with existing issuers, by developing creative debit solutions that deliver meaningful value for partners.","Wrapping up my part, our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates the strength of the Discover business model and our ability to deliver sound, profitable growth. The economic environment remains quite good. And we believe we're well positioned to deliver continued strong results.","I'll now ask Mark Graf to discuss our financial results in more detail.","Mark Graf","Thanks, Roger, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. Looking at the key elements of the income statement, revenue growth of 7% this quarter was driven by strong loan growth and a higher net interest margin. With respect to the provision for loan losses, about two-thirds of the 8% increase reflects the seasoning of our strong loan growth, with the remaining third due to continued supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry.","Operating expenses rose 6% year-over-year, due to higher compensation expense and investments in support of growth and new capabilities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was just under 22%, due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. We continue to expect that our affective tax rate for the full year will be about 24%.","Turning to slide 5. Total loans increased 7% over the prior year led by 8% growth in credit card receivables, with the majority of this increase coming in the form of standard merchandise balances. The contribution from promotional balances decelerated from the prior year and was a relatively modest contributor to growth this quarter.","Looking at our other primary lending products, our organic student loan portfolio increased 9% year-over-year, while total private student loans balances were up 2%. Personal loans also increased 2%, which was in line with expectations given the slowdown in originations we've discussed over the past few quarters.","Moving to the results from our payment segment. On the right-hand side on slide 5, you can see that proprietary volume rose 5% year-over-year. In Payment Services, PULSE volume continue to grow with a 9% increase over the prior year, driven by both new issuers as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Network Partners volume increased 24%, primarily driven AribaPay, while Diners Club volume was down slightly from the prior year due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.","Moving to revenue on slide 6. Net interest income increased $205 million or 10% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and increased market rates. Total non-interest income decreased $17 million, primarily driven by a 9% decline in net discount and interchange revenue.","Gross discount in interchange revenue increased, driven by higher sales volume, which was up 7% year-over-year. However, this was more than offset by increased rewards costs due to higher customer engagement in the 5% rotating category. This higher engagement was the result of our featuring groceries this quarter as opposed to gasoline in the first quarter last year.","As shown on slide 7, our net interest margin was up 23 basis points year-over-year and 11 basis points sequentially coming in at 10.46% for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of last year, the net benefit of a higher prime rate was partially offset by higher costs in both brokered and direct-to-consumer deposits as well as higher interest charge-offs. Compared to the fourth quarter, the net benefit of higher prime rate was partially offset by higher costs and brokered and direct-to-consumer deposits with interest charge-offs being much less of a factor.","Total loan yield increased 58 basis points from a year ago to 12.8%, primarily driven by 57-basis-point increase in card yield and 74 basis point increase in private student loans. Prime rate increases and a slight increase in revolve rate led card yields higher, partially offset by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge-offs. The increase in student loan yield was primarily driven by increased short-term interest rates.","On the liability side of the balance sheet, average consumer deposits grew 15%, reflecting our success in attracting more stable and cost-effective funding. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter, increasing 15 basis points sequentially and 56 basis points year-over-year. While deposit beta did increase, cumulative betas continue to be better than historic norms.","Turning to slide 8. Total operating expenses were $56 million higher than the prior year with the efficiency ratio at 37.1%, a nice improvement quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven by average salaries, which included the impact of the higher minimum hourly wage we implemented in May of last year.","A higher level of advertising spend drove marketing expense up 5% from the first quarter of last year, representing a lower growth rate than the 8% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. Increased information processing costs reflects our ongoing investments in infrastructure and analytic capabilities. Professional fees were up year-over-year, primarily driven by increased collection costs related to higher recoveries in the quarter.","I'll now discuss credit results on slide 9. Total net charge-offs rose 16 basis points from the prior year. The seasoning of loan growth from the past few years and supply-driven credit normalization continue to be the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs. Credit card net charge-offs rose 18 basis points year-over-year.","From a sequential perspective, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge-offs. This positive trend reflects the fact that normalization continues to moderate. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 12 basis points year-over-year and two basis points sequentially. Looking forward, we expect to see continued solid credit performance in the card business.","The credit performance of private student loans remain strong with net charge-offs down 26 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially as a result of efficiency gains in collections. Personal loan net charge-offs were up 50 basis points from the prior year and four basis points sequentially. The 30-plus delinquency rate was up 14 basis points year-over-year and decreased nine basis points sequentially.","Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 40 basis points sequentially, as card loan balances exhibited their normal seasonal decline. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 88%.","To sum up the quarter on slide 11, we generated 7% total loan growth and a 26 return on equity. Our consumer deposit business posted robust growth of 15%, while deposit betas remain below expected levels. With respect to credit, while our charge-off rates had increased as loan growth seasons and credit conditions normalize, performance remains consistent with both our expectations and our return targets.","Finally, we're continuing to execute on our capital plan, with strong loan growth and capital returns helping to bring our Tier 1 ratio closer to target levels. In conclusion, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and we remain comfortable with guidance we provided for 2019.","That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Thedra, to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good afternoon.","Roger Hochschild","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Just wanted to have two quick questions. One, on the rewards you highlighted that look this is the 5% rotating groceries. So as we go into next quarter, given the fact that you're going to have a different rotating, the question is, we would expect that you would have a decline in that rewards rate similar to prior years we've gone from grocery to gas over left in the following quarter, is that a fair expectation?","Mark Graf","So what I would say, Betsy, I don't want to get into business doing quarterly guidance on rewards rates, but what I would say is you're absolutely, correct that the grocery category is the most lucrative. It's really easy for people to engage and max out the benefits.","If you think about it, to spend $1,500 in groceries in the quarter, you only need to spend something less than $125 a week. So not a lot of people spend it on gas, but a lot of people spend that on groceries. So it tends to be very lucrative when we run that one. We did not very specifically revise our guidance on rewards rate. Matter of fact, I think in my prepared remarks I retreated all of our guidance we provided. So that probably -- that combination should probably give you a pretty good answer to that question.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then on the expense side, marketing costs looks like it decelerated a little bit. And I'm just wondering, is that because you don't need to spend as much too and send people to take the card out, because you've got the rotating and groceries? And so, is that a little bit of an offset to changing the category next quarter? Or is there something else that we should be thinking about maybe the efficiency that you've got going on the marketing spend, maybe that's what's going on there and it's more persistent, that's essentially the question?","Roger Hochschild","Yeah. We're certainly seeing efficiency in our marketing spend. But I think a lot of that were just leveraging to drive more growth and to put on, for example, increased number of new accounts. There is a bit of an offset in terms of stimulating the portfolio, when we have a program that has as broad participation as grocery. But it also impacts new account marketing and there can be elements of seasonality to our spend as well. So I wouldn't necessarily read too much into it.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Obviously, NIM came in quite strong relative to our expectations and obviously, higher than the guidance, part of another range. I guess, Mark, when we look ahead, is there anything that should cause any downward pressure? Or should we assume that these are buildup of this level for the rest of the year?","Mark Graf","No. I would say, again, we reiterated that NIM guidance. So along with all the rest of our guidance is that 10.3 plus or minus, Sanjay. We would expect just to give you a little bit of a thought there, we would expect a little bit of compression probably as we head into the second quarter.","I think it's a couple of different things. Number one, revolve rate seasonality drives a piece of it, right? You're going to have a paydowns from some revolvers within normal seasonality, if you will. And then, of course, deposit cost continue to increase modestly as well. So you'll probably see a little bit of that.","So I'd expect something in the order of mid single-digit compression in NIM from the first quarter into the second quarter. We feel good about the NIM guidance for the full year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And my follow-up question is on CECL. Obviously, we got a little bit more clarity there from FASB. And one of your competitors came out and gave a pretty high number in terms of what they expect the impact on card balances to be. I was wondering if you had anymore guidance as it relates to CECL?","Roger Hochschild","Sure. So I want caveats in here, Sanjay. I guess I would say, our models are not yet fully validated. There is a number of alternatives that remain under evaluation, and we're still analyzing a number of factors for a potential inclusion or exclusion based on their predictive capabilities over time.","In addition, I just point out remind you that the ultimate impact won't really be determinable until the date of adoption, because it's really heavily dependent on both the composition and trends in our portfolio as well as our forward-looking view of the economy at the time of adoption.","So -- but basically, if you want a preliminary estimate, I would say, based on the view that we have right now, you would have seen our total reserves, not just card, total reserves, somewhere between 55% and 65% higher than where they were this quarter, assuming we had adopted the standard this quarter.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then when we think about how you're thinking about capital return, obviously, there is a phase-in element to it. How should we think about how you're planning for that?","Mark Graf","Yeah, I think we've known about the phase-in all along. So we've been planning for that. And I think all of our forward capital planning contemplated nothing disconnected from a numbers I just shared with you.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good evening guys.","Mark Graf","Hey, Ryan good evening.","Ryan Nash","Mark, maybe just a follow-up on the net interest margin question. I understand you're not in the business of quarterly guidance. When I think back years ago, when points in time when rates were stable. The NIM would have positive seasonality in the back half of the year. So I just want to maybe understand the puts and takes once we get beyond the next quarter. And then just related to that, if we are in a fed environment here, how do you think about the impacts on your deposit pricing going forward?","Mark Graf","So maybe as opposed to giving specific guidance thoughts quarterly or seasonally, if you will, maybe I'll just talk about the key things that impact the margin and we would cover it that way, Ryan a little bit.","So market rates, obviously, you talk about our current thoughts are the fed is done, right? There is no forward moves factored in any of our guidance. Portfolio mix will play a part. That is seasonal, right? There are times when you see higher level of revolve rate, lower level of revolve rate. There is also an element of that, that somewhat unpredictable, right? We do see transactors from time-to-time, coming in and engage and other times we see them disengage. And you can't always ascertain as to exactly why.","So there is a seasonal element there. And there's just a local wildcard element there as well. Levels of promotional activity going to affect that. We said, we don't expect this year to be assembly promotional as last. Interest charge-offs, we've talked about normalization continues to moderate, but it's not over. And we do have the seasoning of growth. So there'll be a factor, but less of the factor probably. Deposit betas are there.","I'll punk that to the second part of your question and obviously, funding mix and funding rates. And obviously, as we have fundings rolling off, we're replacing those fundings in a higher rate environment, so that's probably a bad guy.","As far as deposit betas go, they remain fairly very well managed, Ryan. I mean, if you look at through history, usually deposit rates keep going up for a little while after market rates stop, but it's not particularly concerning factor for us.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Appreciate the color. And then Roger, we\u2019ve heard a competitor to talk about being capital online. I think late last year you talked about tightening a bit. But you're still seeing a high single-digit growth. Can you just talk about what you're doing online? And are you still tightening credit? And or do you expect that we could continue to sustain this type of growth? Thanks.","Roger Hochschild","Yes. I want to make clear that we're tightening credit as we grow. And that I do expect unless we see significant changes in economics to the good side, that this lane of cycle, we'll continue to be quite a little being on the cautious side. So, as I look at the changes that come through credit policy, they continue to be more on the contractionary side than expansionary. That doesn't mean we're not still looking to leverage our advances in analytics.","So identified we take kind of swap-in, swap-out that would let us grow faster and improve credit performance. And then continued focus on differentiation, the better your product is and the better you can compete in the marketplace that would drive your growth even as you are disciplined on the credit side. And I think that's always been one of our hallmarks here.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good evening Roger and Mark. One of your competitors has indicated that the digital investments they've been making over the years have positioned them to exit legacy data centers and fully migrate to the cloud by roughly the 2020 time frame. And this positions them for meaningful improvement of operating efficiency by 2021. Can you discuss whether Discover sees a similar potential for a step function improvement and efficiency from a similar dynamic in the future? And any other thoughts around that dynamic would be helpful?","Roger Hochschild","Yes. I mean, certainly, there are benefits from a cost standpoint in migrating from legacy data centers to more a cloud-based infrastructure. But, I guess, I would view that as not necessarily the most exciting piece of the advanced analytics journey. It's really been, how do you leverage the data and that much cheaper storage in the cloud for speed and driving business benefit. And so as we think about the benefits from advanced analytics, that's a piece, but not even necessarily when I see the most exciting piece.","Mark Graf","That, in addition to that, Bill I would also note, we have for a couple of quarters now talked about the fact that we do see an opportunity to bring our efficiency ratio down over time. We've noted as the general purpose issuers we're already the lowest. But we see over time an opportunity to lower it. And that migration into a cloud-based environment is a key piece of that thought process.","Bill Carcache","That's really helpful. Thank you. And separately, can you give us an update on your prepaid debit product is going? What's the engagement from existing Discover customers? Are you attracting new customers? Has there been any pushback for merchants on the higher pricing that you enjoyed due to your Durbin exemption?","Mark Graf","Yes. You're talking about the checking product?","Bill Carcache","Yes.","Roger Hochschild","Yes, so not a prepaid, just a checking.","Bill Carcache","I am sorry. Yes. Great. That's great.","Roger Hochschild","Yes. No. no. We're excited with how that doing. We continue to grow it at a steady pace. We\u2019ve ramped up the marketing of that product. One of the great things about taking account is how sticky the deposits are, but I think that also is part of the challenging growing it. We have not received any pushback from merchants. The volume there is still a very low portion, but in terms of the quality of the accounts, we're booking, we're very excited. Average age is about 35, so targeting that younger demographic we're seeing about 25% of the customers set up direct deposit, but we're also seeing 25% open a savings account.","So that impact on deposits is beyond just the checking balances we get. And you tend to see a lower beta on those savings accounts, when they will also have checking relationship with you. So I would say, continued focus on growth of that product.","Bill Carcache","Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And your next question comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research.","Chris Brendler","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask on the acceleration you saw in sales volume. Was there any extra or lacking processing days, some other issuers and networks you called out, your processing days as well as Easter holidays? So 6.6% growth actually could be little better than you reported to make sure that's the case?","Roger Hochschild","Yes. We would not call any adjustments like that. It's a clean number.","Chris Brendler","Great. And does that mostly driven by the successful rewards promotion, anything else that's driving the increased pickup in spending in the face of most people showing some deceleration this quarter?","Roger Hochschild","I would say, we saw a broad-based pickup in spend. But there's no question that the grocery promotion did play a part on that as well.","Chris Brendler","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Roger, I think the consensus view in the card industry is competition sort of peaked loan growth seems to moderate it. But if you look at credit performance and the returns from Discover and a lot of the other issuers, return are very good.","Looking at some of the banks, at JPMorgan, their loan growth picked up a bit. What do you think the chances are of your bank competitors reaccelerating? Or do you think they're going to look at the cycle and just sort of weight low until we get the downturn?","Roger Hochschild","It's hard to talk for an entire industry. But I think in general, it dominated by large sophisticated players with good risk management who have been to most cycles. So, I guess, I's probably be surprised that someone who started growing aggressively at this point borrowing some fundamental changes in the economy and people is to where we are.","You see quite a lot of discipline out there from the major issuers. We see a lot of continued competitive focus around transactors and at the high end transactor segment. And we tend to focus more on a lend-driven versus spend-driven model. But, again, I would expect continued discipline.","Don Fandetti","And Mark, just to clarify on credit. On delinquency trends year-over-year have been very steady, it sounds like you expect that to sort of stay in that zone, is that correct?","Mark Graf","Yes, I would say, we don't give quarterly delinquency guidance, but I would say, what I would really underscore is, normalization is continuing to moderate, if not over. But for six consecutive quarters now, we're seeing the rate of formation and charge-offs moderate. Delinquency trends are obviously a leading indicator of that for a little bit as well.","So, I would say we feel pretty good. I would say, going forward, provisioning will continue to come more and more a function of loan growth as opposed to that normalization piece.","Don Fandetti","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Roger Hochschild","Hey Moshe.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thank you. So, I guess, I was just wondering, you talked a little bit about marketing spend. Can you relate that to the cost you're a very impressive lower cost for 2018, is that continuing?","Roger Hochschild","Yes. We continue to see strong performance on the cost for new accounts. And again, achieving that when you tighten credit, it tends to be the cheapest more responsive accounts that you cut. So, in a tightening environment, I am even more excited by the progress that the team has.","And again, it's leveraging the advances in analytics and it also continued shift towards more and more of the mix being on the digital side. But we expect continued strong performance this year as well.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks. And switching over to personal loans business. I mean, the business -- the growth has kind of -- is slowed, but the other metrics are coming off, deteriorating as much as, I guess, as I thought you seen to indicate in the past and noticing that you've got probably a 20%, 25% decline in overall volume in the industry. Can you talk about your plans there? Is that something you would start up again? I mean, how do you think about your performance there and what the outlook is?","Roger Hochschild","Yes, I think we've tried to be very explicit around the channels that we cut back on. Some of them were more of the aggregator and the unsolicited channels. And one of the things we highlight was the new vintages we're booking. We're pleased with the credit quality.","So, we have made adjustments both to our account mix and our underwriting strategy. And we're achieving the returns we want from what we can see from the newer vintages. In terms of overall industry mail volume rates, you had a couple players whose mail volumes were just off the chart. And I think it appeared unsustainable. So, I wouldn't be surprised.","The other thing is a lot of them, underwriter much broader spectrum than we do. So, we're probably competing head-to-head against the subsequent of their overall volume. But I would just view that as some of the excesses is getting flushed out of the system. It's probably still going to remain competitive.","Mark Graf","And Moshe, to the point looking a little bit better than what we've taught or guided, I would say, we definitely saw Q1 come in a little bit better. I would say collection strategies and some of the technology we've layered into the synthetic broad has had a pretty meaningful impact.","Not going to call a trend based on one quarter at this point in time, but with charge-offs up only four bps quarter-over-quarter and delinquency coming down, it does feel like possibly there's an opportunity there.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Hi guys. Thanks very much. Mark, you talked about -- you mentioned the terms supply-driven normalization. And I assume that means that kind of incremental or marginal dollar getting into the consumers pockets got a little bit more risk tied to it.","And then Roger, you guys -- you're talking about marginal tightening. So, are you guys seeing some participants into market? You're taking incremental underwriting risk? Is that dictating how you're managing credit trends at this point of time?","Roger Hochschild","It's very hard to see, especially real-time what competitors are underwriting. So, we tend to focus on our product and again, different competitors have different strategies targeting other segments. So, it remains competitive. But, again, we continue to see, as I look at competitors earnings and what they're putting up, people seem to be saying discipline.","Mark Graf","And the supply-driven normalization piece, really a flex of fact that coming out of the crisis, consumer credit was pretty restrained. So, consumer leverage ratios were very low by historic standards. And what we saw is time went on, as consumer credit availability kept back in, a lot more providers willing to provide credit.","So, you saw consumers re-lever back toward normalized levels of leverage. And that's what really driven that. The supply credit has driven that re-leveraging and its driving normalization of loss rate.","John Hecht","Okay. And then, I know it's early on, Mark, but you talk about seasoning of the credit book normalization and so forth. How do you think the 2018 vintage looks against the 2017 vintage at this point in time?","Mark Graf","It's too early to call. And we don't typically tend to talk about vintages in isolation. What I would say is, I think, both Roger and I have over the course of the last couple of quarters talked about advancements in advanced analytics and our ability to do a better job, targeting and detecting synthetic fraud as well. So, I would say, we feel good about the current accounts we are booking and those we booked in 2018.","John Hecht","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Chris Donat","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, wanted to follow up on your comment on deposit betas. And I'm just wondering if there is anything you're seeing in the competitive market? You said that the overall deposit betas were pretty well managed.","I'm just wondering if you're seeing any competitors be more aggressive than you'd like. Or do you feel like, because of what you have in deposit now and even the savings accounts, private checking and that you don't need to worry about what competitors do?","Mark Graf","I would say, there's always somebody who you scratch your head about a little bit in most businesses, I guess. But in terms of where we are, I mean, cycle to date, I think our beta on our deposits has been 51. So continues to be lower than you would expect at this point in time.","I would say, we are now up to -- I think, traditionally we've said over 60% of our depositors have a relationship with us on the card side as well. I think that is now approaching 70%. I think it's up to like 68% at this point in time.","So that cross-sell provides some virtuous benefit there. They don't tend to be just retail capital markets customers re-shopping. So we tend to target being in that six to 10th place in the bank rate table, as opposed to the first and the fifth place, and it's a strategy that had e served both us and our customers well, we think.","Chris Donat","Okay. And then, on a completely different topic, just wondering, as you think about the student loan market, there was one of the democratic presidential candidates, for that a proposal that included canceling private student loans -- again, it's a proposal.","But anyway, just as you think about student loans, some competitors had exited the market over the years and I think partly because of the concerns the regulatory environment could change. Just how do you think about the potential for big changes in regulation of student loans, including your private student loans, not just the federal side?","Roger Hochschild","Yes. I wouldn't read too much yet into the proposals of individual democratic candidates. So I think we have a long way to go before anyone's elected or anything gets put into law. It is a very, very complex product to originate. And I think when the federal loan program expanded, a lot of players decided the volume wasn't worth it.","We're very excited about that business and it continues to perform well. Your pricing more new entrants coming into that than exit, as I look at this year's season versus the last. But it's a business that we feel good about.","Chris Donat","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Thanks guys for taking my questions. Look, we did see a delay in tax refunds. But I think by the end of tax season, it seems to have really caught off on a year-over-year basis. I am curious, if you saw any state level distortions that we should think about as we consider normal seasonality as we move through the rest of the year?","Mark Graf","No, Rick. We really didn't see much out of the ordinary in terms of any pockets of particular strength or pockets of particular weakness.","Rick Shane","Great. Thanks, Mark.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Thanks. I have a two-part question around capital planning. Could you just talk about what the capital planning and approval process looks for you here, both timing and process over the next year? And then second question is, I think in the past, you've historically talked about eventually targeting an economic capital level of maybe 10% to 11% CET1, but it had obviously be about that, given some of the regulatory constraints. But given maybe a less constrained process going forward, should we expect you to kind of migrate down towards that level? And if so, how I might see some kind of play a part in that transition?","Roger Hochschild","So I would say the capital planning process for us at this point in time continues to evolve. There is the guidance out there about the $100 million to $250 million banks that still requires a little bit more specificity, so we understand exactly what it ultimately going to look like.","But I would say, this year, specifically, we were granted an exemption from CECL and had a worksheet-based, formula-based approach to improve our capital ask, if you will. Still a strong governance process through our Board and everything else around that and our planned capital actions, we're not outside the range that was allowed in that process.","Yes, we definitely see an opportunity to continue to migrate our capital levels lower. I think we've said that with the CCAR, having been modified or gone away for us that the rating agencies, Mark, are probably the buying constraint for us at this point in time. I think 10.5% is definitely in the cards in our eyes at this point in time. And the CECL overlay, there is the three-year phase-in associated with that. And getting back to my earlier comments, the 55% to 65% range I gave earlier with an awful lot of caveats, I would say is not inconsistent with our thoughts or the thinking around that target capital ratio.","Mark DeVries","Got it. Thank you.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","And your final question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Brian Hogan","This is Brian Hogan turning for Bob Napoli. Good afternoon.","Roger Hochschild","Hey, Brian.","Brian Hogan","First question actually on the home equity loan product, which is in the other loans. Obviously, you got some pretty strong growth there, 89% in that category. I guess, what is the long-term potential of that product? And how long can it grow at a very rapid pace? And what is your plan to grow?","Mark Graf","Yeah. I would highlight it is coming off a very small base. So over time, we think it can grow into a nice business, but it's going to be, while it's a meaningful portion of our overall loan book.","Brian Hogan","All right. And then the next -- final question is actually more related to your payments and network outlook. Just what are you doing to drive more growth along that -- along your network in your payments business and obviously you have SAP Ariba, but SAP doing more stuff with competitors as well like American Express in my view. Are you seeing -- what are you seeing out there from like a partnership perspective or what are you doing to grow that network business?","Roger Hochschild","Yeah. So you mentioned the SAP Ariba arrangement the amount American Express, I don't think -- expect that to have a material impact on profitability of our arrangement with SAP. There is -- it's hard to go over everything we're doing on the payment side. There's a couple of highlights here, certainly PULSE represents a significant portion of our profitability. They continue to execute well as you can see from the growth there. And we see room for continued growth. ","We also -- I probably most excited by some of our international network partnerships. We call them our net-to-net where we provide technical support, including our BIN ranges, chip spec, et cetera. There we provide acceptance for them everywhere outside their home market. They provide acceptance for us. I just got back from a regional conference in Vietnam and very excited about opportunities we're seeing in Asia.","So again, we see a lot of room to continue growing our payment segment, but also continuing to leverage our proprietary network to drive value for our core card issuing business.","Brian Hogan","All right. Thank you. ","Operator","And we do have a question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thank you for sneaking me in. Mark, just a couple of quick questions. In the past, you've talked to the proportion of your growth in receivables that coming from existing customers. Has that trend changed at all recently?","Mark Graf","No. It's been pretty healthy. It tends to bounce somewhere between 60\/40 and 40\/60. So on average we talk about it sort of as a 50\/50 kind of range. This quarter, I think it trended a little bit more towards the 60% new and 40% back book, but again, relatively consistent.","Eric Wasserstrom","And in your K, you had a disclosure about some change in TDR policy. Can you just explain what was occurring there?","Mark Graf","So, last year, there were a number of workout programs that we decided we should classify as TDRs. So you saw a big migration in early last year as we went through the process of reclassifying those programs into TDRs. That was a big piece of the puzzle. And then as we continue to originate significantly larger vintages over time, you see migration into TDRs as well. I would say, there's been a little bit noise out there we've heard on the TDR book. I would say -- I really don't think it's warranted.","If you look at the 90-day past dues in TDRs, they have continued to be below -- slightly below 5% on a very consistent basis over the course of the last two years. And those programs can be a very effective way to work with customers. So, we think it's customer-friendly and the credit impacts that are negligible.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. Thanks very much. ","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","And I will now turn the floor back over to Craig Streem for any additional or closing remarks.","Craig Streem","Sure. Thanks, Thedra and thank you all for your attention, your questions. You know how to find us for any follow-up. We're there for you. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7042":["Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) Q1 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call April 19, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Bill Franklin - VP, IR","David Nelms - Chairman and CEO","Mark Graf - CFO and EVP","Analysts","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Henry Coffey - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Christopher Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Matthew Howlett - UBS","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities","Richard Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Bob Napoli - William Blair & Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Bill Franklin","Thank you, Connor. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of Discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the first quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.","Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated.","So, now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David Nelms","Thanks Bill, and welcome, all of you, to our call. For the first quarter, we delivered net income of $575 million, earnings per share of $1.35, and a return on equity of 21%. Our direct banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year, which now brings us into the lower end of our targeted range for 2016.","Specifically, we grew card receivables by 4%, accelerating year-over-year growth versus the fourth quarter. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on cards, as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased.","Our brand, rewards and overall value proposition remained focused on the prime revolver segment, which we believe is the most profitable part of the card market.","Card sales grew by 4% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 6%, which shows that the lower gas prices at the pump remain a drag on card sales. Also, I'll point out that leap year in the first quarter added roughly 1% to sales growth.","Last quarter, we were recognized as highest in customer loyalty in the annual Brand Keys' survey. This marks the 20th consecutive year that we've earned the top spot. I believe our focus on the customer has allowed us to have some of the lowest attrition rates in the industry and will continue to allow us to grow loans profitably.","Our other lending products are performing well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15% and personal loans grew 9% over the prior year. The strong organic student loan growth was driven by disbursements related to students going back to school for the second semester and our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover student loans.","On the funding side, I'm very pleased with the 6% sequential increase in direct-to-consumer deposits. Our consumer deposits grew approximately $2 billion and made up 45% of funding at the quarter end. We captured the growth as investments in marketing over the last several months delivered positive results, specifically in savings accounts and balances.","Moving to our payments business, total volume for the segment declined, as increases in network partners and Diner's Club volume were offset by year-over-year declines in debit volume at PULSE. We believe PULSE volumes will stabilize at approximately current levels for the remainder of the year.","Lastly, in payments, we continue to leverage our proprietary network to deliver great returns in our card issuing business and are pleased with the increasing domestic and global acceptance. Overall, it was a good quarter and we're making progress against our key focus areas for the year.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk you through the details of our first quarter financial results.","Mark Graf","Thanks David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Net interest income increased $121 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin.","Total non-interest income decreased $68 million to $474 million. The prior year's results included $42 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that is absent this year as we subsequently exited the business.","Net discount and interchange revenue was up 2%, driven by increased sales, partially offset by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 106 basis points, up four basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards. Sequentially, the rewards rate was down 12 basis points. The fourth quarter typically represents a seasonal high and also included the Apple Pay rewards bonus.","Protection products revenue declined $10 million, as new product sales remain suspended. Sequentially, protection products revenue was relatively flat; however, we continue to expect some runoff this year.","Moving to payment services, revenue decreased $6 million from the prior year, mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenues by 2% for the quarter.","Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.69% was 32 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 37 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio, as well as the impact of the prime rate increase in December.","On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits 9% and we've completed two ABS deals year-to-date. Funding costs increased only eight basis points, partly as a result of fixed rate debt issuances in the last year muting the impact of rising rates.","Overall, net interest margin expanded 25 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. We achieved good acceleration in card loan growth through stronger sales and an increased revolve rate, so we did not feel a need to increase our promotional mix during the quarter. However, looking forward, we may yet choose to invest some of this NIM benefit to drive continued loan growth.","Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. Last year's results included $37 million in expense associated with the direct mortgage origination business, more than half of which was reflected in employee compensation.","The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities, as well as annual merit increases.","Marketing expenses decreased $20 million, due in part to the timing of card marketing, as well as the elimination of mortgage marketing activities. Professional fees increased $33 million to $160 million, as expenses associated with the AML\/BSA look back project totaled approximately $30 million for the quarters.","We expect the look back project costs to be largely complete in the first half of this year. And finally, other expense was lower, as the prior year included a $20 million addition to the legal reserve.","This quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was about 40%. However, if you exclude the $30 million look back project expense I mentioned a moment ago, total company efficiency ratio was roughly 38.5%.","Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide eight, provision for loan losses was higher by $34 million compared to the prior year, due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth.","This quarter we increased reserves $52 million, while last year we had a $30 million reserve build. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.34% decreased by six basis points year-over-year and increased 16 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus day delinquency rate of 1.68% increased four basis points year-over-year and was down four basis points sequentially.","On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.","Moving to private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, decreased 18 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from the benign credit environment, as well as a couple of items that we've discussed in the past, specifically, more effective collection strategies, as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year.","Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 26 basis points to 1.92%, as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come into repayment. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.","Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 23 basis points from the prior year and the over 30 day delinquency rate was up 21 basis points to 97 basis points. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the expected seasoning of recent loan growth.","Next, I'll touch on our capital position on slide nine. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased sequentially by 30 basis points to 14.2%, due to the seasonal decline in loan balances from the fourth quarter. This ratio declined 50 basis points from the prior year, due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks, and dividends.","In the quarter, we again repurchased nearly 2% of our common stock. Lastly, while we did not recognize any material tax benefits this period, there will be a favorable resolution to an outstanding tax matter which will have the one-time effect of lowering the effective tax rate for the second quarter.","In summary, it feels like a good start to the year, with a strong margin and good loan growth and a continued benign credit environment. We expect to see provisioning driven by loan growth and will continue to work diligently to manage the core expense base as we absorb increasing regulatory and compliance costs.","That concludes our formal remarks. So, now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Connor, to open the line up for Q&A. Connor?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just had a question on the revolve rate. Was wondering if you could just talk about what drove that higher. Was it something that you guys were doing, or was it just a broader consumer trend? Obviously, kind of, in this market, people are jittery about the macro. Any comments on the macro would be helpful as well. Thank you.","Mark Graf","Sanjay, it's Mark, I'll let David pile on as well here, but I think the revolve rate was really driven by a continued focus on the revolver in our book. And I think, as we telegraphed on the last -- on the call last quarter, over the course of last year, we pulled back a number of activities that weren't driving the kinds of behavior that we wanted to see in the book and had refocused our efforts really along some of the more traditional areas where we had emphasized growth in the portfolio and that's paid very significant dividends over the course of the last quarter.","I would say it's paid dividends not only in the form of growth from balances from new accounts, but also growth in formerly dormant accounts that have reactivated also showed good contribution to growth in that regard.","David Nelms","And the only thing I would add is we have been talking about the continued impact of gas prices on sales and that has much less of an impact on loans and has the effect of helping the revolve rate a bit.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And any comments, David, on just the state of the consumer or on the macro?","David Nelms","I think it continues to be steady, but slow growth. And we're seeing sales continue to kind of bump along, increasing from last year. But the consumers are continuing to be cautious and that is -- that makes it tough on the sales line, but is certainly benefiting the credit line where the caution is showing up in continuing great credit results.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Hecht","Thanks very much, guys. Real quick, Mark, can you quantify the tax benefit in Q2 just so we have a fair model perspective?","Mark Graf","Yeah, I would say with respect to tax benefit, it relates to a matter that's disclosed in our SEC filings. It's the OID treatment of cashback bonus. It's for an extended period from 1999 to 2007, and it's a pretty complex matter over a number of years, so we are still in the process of putting a fine point on it.","I guess what I would say is on the tax line itself, it looks to be kind of a mid-8 figure kind of number in the quarter that we would indeed recognize. So I think that probably gives you a good triangulation for how to think about it.","John Hecht","Okay. Thanks very much. And then second question, you got a little bit better margin expansion than we expected from rising prime rate. Is all that priced in the portfolio, or is there some kind of residual upside as we stretch into the second quarter?","Mark Graf","No, I think it really relates to, we talked on the last call about a natural upward bias in the NIM in the book and that we thought it might lean more heavily into promotional activity. We didn't end up doing that, as it turned out, because we saw growth reaccelerating along the lines of what we hoping for from a cadence perspective.","So I think I would say, as you look forward over this year, I would kind of discourage you from flattening NIM out and just saying, this is where it will be for the rest of the year. I think there would be relative stability in NIM, but it could be affected by promotional activity, that revolving behavior Sanjay asked about a second ago, and obviously, any further moves the Fed makes, because of that positive bias in positioning.","John Hecht","Okay. Appreciate the details. Thanks very much.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ryan Nash","Good afternoon, everyone. David, just following up on one of the questions that Sanjay asked about, could you maybe just talk about how the efforts to accelerate loan growth are going?","Last quarter, you laid out a handful of initiatives. I was wondering if you could share how they are going, maybe any other metrics you have, account openings, activations, to help us understand what the pipeline could look like for loan growth for the rest of the year.","David Nelms","Sure. Well, I think that the best indicator that our efforts are working in total is just to look at actual loan growth. And so we accelerated from just over 3% to about 4% year-over-year. And as you know, we had just established a new higher 4% to 6% full-year target, also for total loan growth, also for long-term, to be in that target.","So I'm pleased at all of our various actions have moved us into that lower end of the range, and we're certainly taking efforts to continue to move higher in that range, if we're able to, later this year.","And I'd say those efforts include, I mentioned more new accounts. We are continuing to look for places where we can appropriately increase credit lines or extend credit where we expect good and are achieving good results.","Also, some of our new features have been well received, whether it's some of our cash back, Freeze It, continued great take-up of free FICO scores. So I'd say that we have -- I don't think there's a single home run kind of initiative for loan growth, but a whole lot of singles that we are working on across the franchise.","Mark Graf","And Ryan, I' add on to that, just quickly, the loan growth continues to be close to 50\/50 new accounts, as well as existing accounts, which is a really healthy way to see that loan growth coming in.","And if you look at the $2.2 billion in card receivables growth over the course of the last year, over 80% of that is coming in what I'll call the standard merchandise bucket, customers just simply using their cards, exhibiting the behaviors that drive the kind of long-term profitability we want to see out of the book.","Ryan Nash","Got it.","Mark Graf","So it feels very good.","Ryan Nash","Maybe I could just ask one other question, just on credit. If I look this quarter, charge-offs were relatively stable. Delinquencies were relatively stable, up a couple basis points. I was wondering how do we think about the puts and takes.","And Mark, more specifically, since last quarter there was a wide range on outcomes for reserves for 1Q, could you help us how to think about the pace of reserve builds from here, just given there was a release in the second quarter last year. I don't think you're anticipating a reserve release this time. Just want to understand how we should think about reserve builds from here.","Mark Graf","Yes, so Ryan, happy to. I think from my perspective, the $50 million or so we built this quarter, I continue to describe that as essentially noise on a $1.9 billion balance sheet item. It's never going to be exactly flat. It's always going to be bumping along a little bit one way or the other.","I would say provisioning from this point forward is going to continue to be a factor of loan growth and the seasoning of that loan growth. I would not encourage anyone to expect a reserve release in the second quarter.","By the same token, I would not encourage anyone to assume there's going to be some giant take-off in provisioning in the second quarter, either. It feels, again, it's going to be very much a function of loan growth and the seasoning of that loan growth, and it feels like we're in a good general band.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for taking my questions.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Henry Coffey","Yes, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. When you look at the network side of the business, obviously Diner's Club has started to show some positive life and your expenses were lower. What are the next steps forward there?","David Nelms","Well, I think I am pleased with the growth that you acknowledged in Diner's Club, as some of our new partners that have come online in recent years in places like China and other areas start to grow more robustly, and same with network partners, with the volume up very nicely as other networks around the world increasingly coming online and using our network for global acceptance. And I'd say the headwind has been quite severe in the largest segment, which is PULSE.","And as I mentioned in my comments, after several years of a downdraft following the [Indiscernible] and paved actions that Visa took, as well as loss of one major customer, it feels like we have reached a plateau with PULSE, and I think after this year what we're looking to do is to go back to growing PULSE.","And we had a bunch of years of very robust growth in market share and volume in PULSE, up until the actions shortly after Durbin, Amendment went in. And we're working to have that grow, as well, while maintaining those newer areas like Diner's and network partners and AribaPay, where we're seeing nice growth add-on, as well.","Henry Coffey","Great. And then on the overhead side of the equation, Mark, when does the AML\/BSA, when do those extra expenses dwindle away?","Mark Graf","So Henry, I'd put it in two buckets. The look-back project that we continue to call out specifically, I think we see that, in terms of dollars of spend, largely drawing to a close next quarter, at this point in time. So I think we can say that piece is close to being done with the case work.","I think the other piece of AML\/BSA is really what I would call building out the AML\/BSA process within the organization. We're largely covering a lot of that increased expense through finding efficiencies elsewhere in the business model. So I'd take you back to second of my prepared remarks where I said roughly a 40% efficiency ratio all-in.","But if you exclude that look-back that we expect to bleed off after next quarter, we're printing about a 38.5% efficiency ratio this quarter. Now I think expenses are never flat. I think next quarter they may be inflated a little bit as we bring some things across the goal line and all. But I would stand by the expense guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.","Henry Coffey","Great. And congratulations on a good quarter. Thank you.","Mark Graf","Thanks, Henry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Christopher Donat","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to explore on the personal loans business, because we've seen the deceleration of the growth there over the last couple of years and some of that's coincided with the entrance of the marketplace lenders or peer-to-peer lenders. Are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape there? And would you have any hopes of getting the loan growth back up into the double digits in the coming year or so?","David Nelms","Well, I would encourage you to look at the dollars of loan growth, which last year was an all-time record for growth in our personal loan business. And we continue to grow that very nicely and there was -- the only thing that's really changed is the denominator is getting bigger.","So, percentage is dropping because of the denominator, even as the dollars of originations have gotten bigger. So I wouldn't cite market entrants or competition as being the slowdown.","I think going forward we do think our model is more sustainable, since it's going on our balance sheet. We have long-term customer relationships. We are profitable, in contrast to some of the competitors who are printing some more difficult headlines right now. And so I think we have a very sustainable business model that we continue to grow, we think, well and appropriately.","Christopher Donat","Okay. And just on the marketing side, I guess there were some timing issues that Mark had commented on. So it's down 11% year-on-year. Would you expect, Mark, it to be more flat year-on-year going forward, or even up, or is it just, are we in the ballpark in terms of year-on-year comparisons from here?","Mark Graf","So, I guess what I'd say is we're continuing to really manage the interplay between marketing spend, as well as rewards rate. And as we're leaning a little bit more into rewards rate, with our double new account promotion and some of the other things we're doing, I think we're viewing that as interchangeable with the market spend. So to some degree, some of the decline in marketing spend you see is related to that.","The other thing I would say is there's obviously some timing of spend, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that occurs throughout the course of the year. The first quarter was not a particularly high point, from a marketing spend standpoint.","And then the other thing I would just point out is in the year-over-year comparison, we did have the mortgage marketing spend in there last year, which I would remind you, you kind of have to peel back out for comparability.","Those would really be the bits and pieces, puts and takes. I think ultimately, we continue to have a very disciplined approach to marketing spend. We want to make sure we're getting the results we see for it.","Again, when we saw we weren't getting some of the results we were looking for through some of the listing sites and other channels last year in the middle of the year, we pulled back on those, because we want to make sure we're driving the kind of growth that's going to drive the right kind of long-term profitability.","Christopher Donat","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti","Yes, Mark, can you talk a little bit about the rewards being so low this quarter and how you're thinking about that in context of the full-year guidance? And then maybe provide a little bit of color on your thoughts about the industry in general on rewards. We're starting to see some pretty high offers, in the 5% range. Want to get your updated thoughts there.","Mark Graf","So, I'll tackle the rate and dollar questions, then I'll let David talk about the industry trend. I guess what I would say is we're still very comfortable with the full-year rewards rate at 115 basis points. Couple things to think about there. Number one, we are going to continue running our double rewards program for new accounts, at least for the next quarter and maybe beyond.","And I would say from the standpoint of the rewards perspective, it is down a little bit from where we were in the fourth quarter, but there's generally a peak seasonality effect in the fourth quarter. And in addition, the fourth quarter was elevated because of Apple Pay and the special promotion we ran in the most recent fourth quarter.","So, I think we're up about 4 basis points year-over-year in terms of rewards rates. So that 115 on a full-year basis still feels like a good place to triangulate.","David Nelms","And I would just say that it's no surprise that competitors are aggressively offering cash rewards programs, because it's what consumers most want and it's just very attractive to consumers.","And I think that we are in a -- we've been at this game for 30 years now -- and I think our combination of 1% cash back, 5% rotating categories, additional value coming from our network partners who add value that doesn't hit our expense line, the elimination of breakage on the back end that we put in place a year ago, consumers still tell us that regardless of topline headline numbers, most consumers, we think, really like our program. And we think we have the right balance between sustainable cost and great value to consumers.","Donald Fandetti","So, David, you don't see -- you're not sensing a big step forward in terms of accelerated reward offers. It's more of just a continued, steady competitive environment?","David Nelms","I think so. I think it accelerated a few years back. Since that time, the competitors have swapped between years. Two years ago, there was one competitor was heavy. They kind of pulled back, then another one came in. And so I think we're at a fairly steady state, which is an intense environment, but I don't really see it getting worse from here.","And the history of the industry has been when people have something that seems unsustainable, they eventually peel it back. But my guess is when some of those competitors peel back, someone else will enter the fray. So we're competing as if this is going to be the -- we think it's the steady state, a lot of competition and we have to win this game.","Donald Fandetti","Thank you.","Mark Graf","From a value perspective and profit perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Ho","Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on credit. Have you seen any, on the margin credit deterioration, related to energy or even some of your lower FICO customers? And a follow-up on that would be, would credit deterioration potentially come from some of your competitors increasing credit lines or just loosening that up over time?","Mark Graf","David, it's Mark, I'll take the first stab and David can pile on. I would say with respect to the energy-related part of the question, we have seen some deterioration in the energy-related states, but I would describe it really as prior to the significant drop in oil prices, all of those markets were performing better than the national average for our portfolio.","They've basically come down to the national average for our portfolio. So it's something we're watching very closely, but it's not something that currently gives us significant pause or concern.","All the credit metrics we're watching in the portfolio really speak to a continued benign environment with, again, as I said earlier, reserving from here really more a function of loan growth. David, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that.","David Nelms","No, I agree. I think in general, I think about energy exposure as being business loan-related, which we're not in. And I think on the consumer side, it certainly has to have an impact. Any time there's loss of jobs or income in the industry, it affects consumers.","But even with the high percentage reductions in employment in that industry, it's just not that huge of a number on a national level, since we're completely national in scope. It's not going to be, as an example, like the mortgage that hit lots of consumers nationally. This is a pretty localized impact.","David Ho","Okay. And then are you seeing, or potentially expecting any pressure from more credit lines being offered by competitors? I mean, servicing ratios have kind of stayed flat. Mortgage debt has been replaced by a little bit on the consumer side in terms of leverage, so, any thoughts there?","David Nelms","Well, I think that, I think that there may be less -- if rates slowly rise, there's probably a little bit less refinancing that will go on, particularly in first mortgages. And -- but I don't see, I don't see a big impact in the near term. I think we're in a fairly steady state in terms of the credit card industry growing at a slow rate.","Mark Graf","Consumer balance sheets still seem like they are in pretty good shape, David. When you just look at the obligation ratios and when you look at the debt burden that they are carrying, it's a very different scenario now than it was the last time we were at this point in the cycle, so not dissuading you from your belief that we are in a cyclical business we are, but it just feels like the consumer debt burden is still fairly -- really manageable at this point.","David Ho","Okay. Thanks Mark. One more question on the interchange relative to volumes. Interchange fees look like they rose 5% versus volumes closer to 4%, a little bit of a higher margin there. Is that just one-time, or is that mix shift, or how do you see that?","Mark Graf","It's really more a function of spend mix. The fourth quarter tends to see a lot of Big-Box spending around the holiday period and in the first quarter; you tend to see a higher percentage of the mix being smaller merchants. So it's really more mix-driven than anything else, David.","David Ho","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good afternoon. Wanted to just ask on expenses, the other expense line came in later than expected, down quite a bit. Just wanted to get the color around that line item.","Mark Graf","The real big driver in other expense is in the similar quarter. Last year we had a $20 million addition to the legal reserve that was absent this quarter. Beyond that, I would say it's just generally back to what I said earlier, that focus on if you exclude the MLBSA look-back, really trying to find ways to look at the expenses that are creeping into the model from a regulatory and compliance standpoint, making sure we're finding efficiencies and ways to cover those. So I think it reflects the discipline on that front, coupled with the lack of the $20 million addition to the legal reserve.","John Pancari","Right. So therefore, I'm getting noise on my line here. Sorry. So, basically that 100 million, or that 107 appears sustainable at this level?","Mark Graf","Yes, again, I would say expenses do tend to bounce around quarter over quarter. I wouldn't specifically encourage you to cycle to the 107. I think what I would say is we've given guidance for total expenses, really being slightly north of $3.5 billion for the year, I think is how we described it back on the fourth quarter call. We'll stand by that guidance and I think I'll stand by the earlier comments on the other line as well.","John Pancari","Okay, then one more. On the card yield, up quite a bit year-over-year, 37 basis points, up 22 link quarter. I know it's a function of both higher rates in terms of fed move, but also the mix. Can you just talk to us about how we should think about that going forward in terms of the magnitude of incremental upside we could see there as mix evolves?","Mark Graf","Yes, I think what I would say is you now have the prime rate increase is already priced into the portfolio, right? I would say that's there. Obviously, further prime rate increases would potentially have a bearing on it, but assuming the prime rate stays where the prime rate is, I think that whole benefits baked in. The other part of it is a much higher component of revolving balances in the portfolio, right, due to the real strong focus on the revolving consumer.","And the success we've had there, I would say given what's happened to revolve rate, I wouldn't expect really significant increases in revolve rates from here. So from that perspective, I would go back and just generally say if you think about it in a NIM perspective as opposed to specifically a card yield perspective, it feels like you would have, you know, I'll call it again a relatively stable NIM from this level, but you would have some diminution over the course of a year in a stable environment.","But again, I would point out that it could be impacted by we still may make a decision to do a little promotional investment that would have a muting impact there. The revolve rate would have an impact. And again, further prime rate increases would have an impact as well.","John Pancari","Okay, helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions on CCAR. First, relating to last year's, is it reasonable to assume that you guys would seek to max out, I think it was the $2.2 billion authorization you received last year, which I think would imply about 480 million of buyback in the next quarter.","And then separately, relating to the upcoming CCAR, broadly speaking and certainly at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that you guys are continuing to accrete capital to consumers in good health? We've got unemployment rate at the same level, although the starting point is a little bit lower, so the delta is higher.","But you put all the pieces together. Would it be reasonable to assume that you kind of continue to grind closer to 100% payout ratio rather than move farther away from it?","Mark Graf","So if I think about CCAR -- I'll parse out. There's a bunch of questions. I'll try to touch them all. If I miss one, come back with your follow-up. I think with respect to repurchase cadence, we've never given any specific guidance on that front. But I would just kind of say I would expect -- I wouldn't see any reason to expect a radically dissimilar cadence in 2Q, to kind of what you've seen, would be the way I would think about it.","In terms of the overall approach how we think about it, I would say over the last couple years we continue to make what I have described as prudently aggressive asks and every year they have been slightly more aggressive.","I would assume that a reasonable person should assume that we don't see any reason to change that. We recognize we have excess capital today. And we are working diligently within the confines of the CCAR process to be able to return as much of that as prudently possible.","David Nelms","And I might just add on, I think typically we've seen the last few years the fed scenarios getting tougher, not easier, which impacts, but also as our processes have matured and there's greater comfort, we have continued to move into a position of actually working towards our targeted levels. And you've seen our capital.","You see our capital ratios today a bit lower than they were last year. We bought back almost 8% of our stock in the last year and every year we would love it to move a little more quickly towards the target levels and every year we're trying to take steps to do that. But we also, know we just can't get to the target. We won't get approval to get to the target in one fell swoop.","Mark Graf","Think about it as a constrained optimization, drove a total yield last year a total of 10% between dividends and buybacks. So we feel like we're being respectful of our shareholders capital and being prudently aggressive in our asks. Again, the cadence having more aggressive every year I think a reasonable person would assume we wouldn't see a meaningful reason to change that cadence.","Bill Carcache","Understood, extremely helpful. Thank you. If I may squeeze one more in on expenses. Just for clarification Mark? I believe that you had said earlier that the look-back project was drawing to a close next quarter. Should we interpret that to mean that there will be one more quarter with the non-recurring BSA ML cost that would result in a differential between the operating efficiency and the adjusted operating efficiency ratio before they converge, or will they converge starting next quarter?","Mark Graf","No, I think you, I think you're thinking about it right. I would go with your former characterization. There will be one more quarter where those costs are in there and, you know, the good news is I think we are comfortable that we're approaching the end of the case review portion of it is, which is the big dollar portion of the project itself.","So, I would expect to see those yet. That's why I alluded to the fact while we're standing by our expense guidance for the year, we don't expect expenses to be linear across the remaining three quarters and 2Q may actually prove to be the high point quite honestly.","Bill Carcache","Thank you very much.","Mark Graf","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Howlett with UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew Howlett","Thanks. Just on the funding side, can you just go into a little bit more detail what you did with the deposits, how far out you went? And then on the two ABS characterizations, was there any impact on the cost, with the winding that went on? What's the outlook do we all see get two hikes a share maybe you could comment on that in terms of funding.","Mark Graf","I would say the vast majority of the growth in the deposit book has come in the savings product to a lesser degree, the money market and the CD books. So we're very focused on the indeterminate maturities. Those prove to have the lowest data overtime and also the stickiest customer retention characteristics, so that's why we're focusing in that particular area and why it has driven it.","With respect to ABS transactions, I would say the answer is yes, there has been some impact obviously with respect to what's happened in the marketplace in terms of credit spreads.","Overall, I would say our credit spreads are up roughly call it 30 basis points year-over-year, in addition to just the base rate changes, if you will, the index rate changes that have taken place over the course of the last year.","That being said, it's still a very robust market. We were in market last week, did something on the order of $1 billion, give or take, and actually were able to walk pricing in. So, it still feels like a very accessible, very effective channel. Pricing, a little more expensive than it was, but clearly still very attractive funding.","Matthew Howlett","Could you remind us again in going forward, if we do get a tightening cycle, what's the target in terms of deposits again versus securitization and is there one angle that you'd lean on more than others, more than another if we do get the start of a tightening cycle?","Mark Graf","So, we haven't decided bias for deposits. There's a couple of reasons for that, the first of which is, as we've talked, we've worked really hard over the last several years to really have a cross sold deposit base, and we always like to use our balance sheet to support our customers. So, I think that's one reason.","The other reason is because of the betas, right. I mean deposits do not reprice at the same rate as any of the capital markets fundings do, so we would have a decided bias to continue leaning into deposit growth, I would say.","That being said, it takes time to grow deposits, especially relationship-oriented deposits. You can grow them really fast by hanging out the highest rate in town, but that's also got a beta of one.","So, we're trying to do it the old fashioned way, where it adds real value. So, I'd look for us to continue leaning into deposits, but I'm not so sure 9% to 12% growth rate is the way to be thinking about it, but mid to high single-digit growth rates sure sound good.","Matthew Howlett","Absolutely. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. I guess just on the rewards costs, I mean you had talked -- Mark, you had said that you intended to keep the bonus into the second quarter. What would make you change it in the second half? And does the 115 guidance include it for the full year? How should we think about rewards costs relative to that guidance and how it might relate to your plans to grow the business?","Mark Graf","So, as I sit here right now, I still feel very good, Moshe, about the 115 basis points on the full year. I think our double program has been very effective. I think it's driving a big chunk of that revolve behavior that you're seeing out there and is something that we would be probably predisposed to continue. And I wouldn't change the guidance we've put out there in light of anything happening with respect to that.","Moshe Orenbuch","Okay, good. And just a second question. I recognize and applaud the fact that you brought back 8% of the stock, but the constraint isn't actually the percentage of the stock that you bought back, it's the dollar amount, right. So that's basically saying that the share price fell and you were able to take advantage of that, which is wonderful.","But the question is, are you able to push the dollar amount of buybacks a little harder? And I didn't notice any mention of going after the de minimus exemption that some of your peers have done and I'm wondering if you can talk about that.","Mark Graf","Sure. A lot embedded in there. I'll try and tackle all the pieces. I would say first and foremost, again, I think we've been -- driven the highest yields to investors, between dividends and buybacks, of any of the financials out there. So, I think we've been very focused on it and every year, we've gotten more aggressive with that ask.","So, from that perspective, I wouldn't dissuade you, Moshe, from -- again, thinking we would continue to, as we have comfort with the process and as the Fed has comfort with us, continue to be more aggressive there.","In terms of the 1% de minimus ask, I think it has tended to be utilized by people primarily around, what I would call, unexpected events that weren't contemplated in capital plans, compensation dilution being one that comes to mind that I've seen a few folks do and a number of other things, as well.","We would not be hesitant to use something like that if we had a like type event or similar event of some kind come along. But I would say it's clearly the 1%, in our minds anyway, is clearly not designed to be your CCAR approval plus 1% every year. That's really not why it's out there.","Moshe Orenbuch","But I guess if you were to see that perhaps asset growth was at the lower end or lower end of expectations, couldn't that be a reason to think about it?","Mark Graf","I think there could be a lot of reasons to think about it. The question is in what context do the people who allow you to do it, think about it?","Moshe Orenbuch","Okay.","Mark Graf","Right. So, I'm not so sure -- again, I think it's really designed to cover situations that weren't contemplated in a capital plan, as opposed to simply business trajectory issues.","And again, I'd just point you back. We're in a CCAR submission cycle right now. We're going to be more aggressive. And we are driving by far and away the highest total yields of any of the financials with that 10% total yield last year.","David Nelms","And I don't think the exception process is going to move the dial as much as what happens in CCAR itself.","Mark Graf","If you think about it, 1% of our Tier 1 combo would be a little north of $100 million, so it's not exactly going to redefine our earnings stream.","Moshe Orenbuch","Okay. Thanks.","Mark Graf","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Richard Shane","Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Look, we've seen the loan growth start to accelerate back into the target range. And I think that that's, to some extent, a function of optimizing the investments in growth. And you talked about shifting from marketing to rewards and I think laid out the potential that that will continue into the second half of the year.","When I think about investment in growth, marketing is spending in advance, reward is spending concurrently. And then the last way you can invest in growth, and this sounds a little bit strange, but is on the credit side. And that's basically investing in growth down the road, paying for it down the road.","Given your outlook in terms of benign credit, does it make sense at this point to sort of make some of that investment down the road and potentially open up the credit bucket a little bit?","David Nelms","Well, I think that we would -- I would agree that those are all three good levers and we are pulling, where we think appropriate, all three. And in response to one of the earlier questions about what the various causes of us getting back increasing -- accelerating our loan growth, I did cite credit as one of the actions we've taken, in line increases, who we're approving, how we're authorizing. We are working to optimize all of the levers that you just cited.","And the one I would probably add, because I think it's not just about money, the execution, things like new features that may not cost that much money, but maybe move behavior, is a fourth lever that I would add. And I think if you look at what we've produced in terms of innovation the last couple of years compared to others, like Freeze It and Free FICO and on and on, I think that innovation is one of the best ways to move the dial.","Richard Shane","That makes sense. Look, I think one of the facets of your business is that you have very strong customer loyalty. And I'm not necessarily sure how you market that, but it certainly impacts the attrition within the portfolio in an environment where things are really competitive.","David Nelms","Well, I think by not having a leaky bucket, we end up with two things. You don't have to put on as many new accounts to grow a certain rate if you're not losing out the back end, but it also helps us from a credit perspective, because with our average duration of 12 months -- excuse me, 12 years of customer relationship, compared to industry average around eight years, we don't have as many, as high of a percentage in those early years that have much higher credit risk. And that helps explain some of our better credit performance than most of the competitors in our industry.","Richard Shane","Got it, hadn't thought of that. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Just on some thoughts, David, on industry loan growth, if you could. I mean you've seen -- we've seen a ramp up in industry loan growth over the last year from 3% to around 6%. Do you think that is -- and we've seen that with a consumer that's still kind of sleepy.","Is this essentially just the industry itself looking at the profitability of this product and tweaking the credit levers and the incentive levers to drive that growth, such that receding the -- we're setting the seeds for the next credit cycle, if you would? Some thoughts around that would be helpful.","David Nelms","I would bifurcate the industry loan growth between lower credits versus higher credits, call it the subprime business versus the prime business. We really haven't seen -- I haven't seen much acceleration in the prime space. I mean it stopped shrinking. But my best guess is it's growing at 2% to 3% in prime credit scores today.","If you see where the acceleration has come, it's come in the issuers who are in the subprime space, including private label, which obviously a lot of people get that are new to credit. So, there's a high correlation between the high yield competitors and the higher growth competitors at the moment. If you look at -- if you just isolate the prime competitors, some are still shrinking a little bit.","And so I think it's been -- and so how that plays out is, we're not a subprime player, but how does the subprime credit play out and impact those competitors over time? I'm not an expert in that, but I'm comfortable that low growth in prime probably is hard to grow in that space, but is probably good from a credit performance perspective.","Bob Napoli","Okay. Thank you. And just to follow-up on your deposit quality, you've seen a nice pickup in growth or steady growth in a direct-to-consumer Infinity products as a percentage of total funding, 44%, up from 42% a year ago. Where would you like that to be? Where can that go over the next five years, in an efficient manner, if you would? Do you have some targets for that?","David Nelms","Well, we like the fact that it's our largest single funding source. And I'm very comfortable with where it's at. If it grows a little bit more, I think that would be even better. I was really pleased this quarter that we really didn't take our rates up, but yet we saw a very nice inflow of deposits. And so, that's helpful from a funding perspective, a customer relationship perspective.","And I think over time, we'd like to add more checking accounts to the mix, we'd like to continue to grow the indeterminants in general, on savings and money markets, as Mark mentioned earlier. So, if it was a little higher over time, I think that would be even better. But it's -- we feel like it's at a good level right now.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","David Scharf","Thank you. My questions are largely answered, but I did want to get a sense for you, back to the consumer spending patterns, this kind of even, rough mix of 50-50 from both new accounts as well as dormant accounts that's been driving the increase in revolving balances, could you give us a sense for how that mix measures up to both what your expectations were earlier in the year? I'm trying to get a sense for whether 50% of the growth coming from dormant accounts is potentially a bit of a positive surprise from what you would normally expect to see?","David Nelms","Well, I'd say we've been -- our growth over the last several years has been roughly 50-50 base and new accounts. And so I think that's more of a continuation of a trend. I think if you think about sales; that probably comes a little bit higher from new accounts.","And I would say, generally, loans have performed about at what we expected for the year and targeted. We had a lot of programs to go into place and we were happy they worked and they produced the result we expected.","Sales, on the other hand, has continued to disappoint. And while I'm pleased that it was 4%, which matched the 4% loan growth, I would like to see the consumer become a little more -- given the strong balance sheet that they have and their capacity to spend, I'd love to see the consumer in general spend a little more, which would allow us to grow sales a little faster.","David Scharf","Got it. And the I guess two percentage differential on card sales attributable to gas, just given the upward trajectory really since your Q4 call and prices at the pump, should we expect that to narrow considerably this quarter?","David Nelms","I wouldn't say considerably, because remember, it's the year-over-year change. And so unless we got a dramatic increase in gas prices, it's going to probably be lower than the same quarter last year all year long.","Now it may narrow each quarter, if it stabilizes. And it's certainly not as big of a downdraft as it was last year. But gas prices were over 10% of our sales 18 months ago. Now they're 5% or 6%. And so they're becoming less of an impact. But it's not going -- the 2% isn't going to go to zero next quarter because of the year-over-year nature.","David Scharf","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark DeVries","Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to comment -- or drill down on some of the comments again around the guidance and the NIM, in particular. Going into the year, you guided to relatively stable NIM and that's somewhat vague. But you're up 25 bps year-over-year and even slightly higher based on the average for 2015.","And it sounds like, Mark, what you're saying is that's kind of biased flat. It could go a bit lower if you lean into some more of the promotional balance opportunities. But is it right to say that that guidance no longer holds, that we're looking at a higher NIM year-over-year than what we had in 2015?","Mark Graf","Yeah if you think back to the fourth quarter call, I think what we said is there is a natural upward bias in NIM, but we were calling for -- call it, relative stability because we anticipated we might be doing some more promotional-related activities.","The good news is we saw the reacceleration in growth we were looking for based on some of the things we did back in the middle of last year and it was coming in the form of good old fashioned utilization of the card, both in the hands of the existing card member base and the legacy card member base.","So, I think we are definitely, Mark, saying we have not taken the right, for lack of a better term, to increase promotional activities off the table, which is why I'm saying I wouldn't put just a flat NIM in from here for the remainder of the year, but I think it's a very safe bet to say on a full-year basis, the NIM is not going to approximate the full-year basis of last year. I think that's a very safe bet at this point in time, based on the current trajectory of growth we're seeing.","Mark DeVries","Okay. But given the success you've had with the loan growth so far without the promotional, is it right to assume that if we take our NIM down a little bit because you do more promotional, that's somewhat additive and that maybe we should expect loan growth to accelerate more from here?","Mark Graf","We are not calling out that we're going to do any increased promotional activities, nor are we giving out guidance for what we expect the trajectory of loan growth to be from here. Just to be clear, all we're saying is at this point in time -- to this point, we have seen the growth trajectory reaccelerate into our target range and we feel good that we're getting it in a very constructive way that drives great returns through time. We haven't taken off the table the ability to invest more heavily in promotional activities, but we're not calling that we're going to do it either, just to be clear.","Mark DeVries","Okay. I'm just trying to clarify some of the give and take between some of these promotional things I think you indicated, that that you feel good about the rewards rate so you still would look to be doing, I think presumably, a lot of the double cash promotion than if you were to lean into promotional. I'm just thinking of that as being potentially additive to your growth. Is that at least a fair way to think about it?","David Nelms","Well, one way to think about it is we're at the bottom end of our range and we might want to take some actions to move it further into the range.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Fair enough.","Mark Graf","And just to clarify, Mark, you understand promotional comment could be on the balance side in terms of balance transfers or sales promotion, not just--","Mark DeVries","Yeah, absolutely. Yes.","Mark Graf","Okay.","Mark DeVries","Yes. Thank you.","Mark Graf","Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill Franklin for final remarks.","Mark Graf","So, actually, this is Mark Graf. I'm going to jump in before I let Bill prepare his final remarks. To show that we are committed to timely and accurate disclosure, my Controller just passed me a note and said he's comfortable with me pointing you to a $40 million benefit on the tax line in the second quarter.","So, to the extent there was any lack of clarity around my prior guidance, I would just say the number to think about for the second quarter tax benefit we discussed earlier is about $40 million, give or take. Bill, sorry to preempt you there.","Bill Franklin","So, thank you everyone for joining us. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to call the Investor Relations department. Have a good night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great evening."],"7236":["Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2017  6:00 PM ET","Executives","Craig Streem - IR","David Nelms - Chairman and CEO","Mark Graf - CFO","Analysts","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet","Rick Shane - JP Morgan","Don Fandetti - Wells Fargo","Chris Brendler - Buckingham Research","John Hecht - Jefferies","Chris Donat - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Operator","Good afternoon. My name is Julie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Discover Financial Services Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. ","Craig Streem, you may begin your conference.","Craig Streem","Thank you, and welcome everybody to today\u2019s call. Moving on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the third quarter 2017 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. And of course we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Our call today will include remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer covering third quarter highlights and developments and then Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, I\u2019d ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to David, who will begin on page three of the presentation.","David Nelms ","Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. For the third quarter, we delivered net income of $602 million on revenue growth of 10%. Earnings per share were $1.59, and a return on equity of 22%. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the strong growth, we achieved across all product lines. We drove total loan growth of 9% as we continue to focus on delivering profitable prime loan growth. In payment services, total volume grew 16%, our fastest growth in more than six years. ","Looking specifically at card, loan growth was split about evenly between new accounts and growth of existing customers. While the third quarter of last year was highly competitive characterized unusually aggressive offers on new products from a number of competitors, this year some of the issuers has appeared to fall back a bit. However, our strategy and discipline remain unchanged. We continue to innovate and enhance our flagship product the Discover card and offer unique features like cash back match with allows new card members to earn double the cash back bonus in their first year and creates meaningful benefit for us to sustain customer engagement. ","Our consistent approach and a slightly less than tense competitive environment have created more opportunity to drive both sales and receivables growth without a significant increase in marketing and expenses. Overtime, strong customer engagement drives lower voluntary attrition and enhanced growth. For Discover attrition has remain consistently low among prime revolvers reflecting the loyalty of our customer base. The foundation for our strong performance is our commitment to outstanding customer service and a unique and expanding feature set in our Discover card. ","In our advertising, we remind customers that we treat you like you treat you. Customers are loyal to us in part because we serve them well which includes providing the helping hand in response to unexpected events. The Equifax data breach and the increased potential for personal identity theft it has created have been on the forefront of consumers\u2019 minds. The breach resulted in an increase in call volume from customers but highlighted that we have been on the right path and focusing on features and innovations that help consumers to monitor their credit. In July even before we became aware of the Equifax breach, we introduced a free alert service available to all Discover card members. Enrolled card members will receive an alert if we find their social security numbers on any of thousands of risky websites. We will also monitor their credit reports and notify them of any new account openings. This feature is the latest example of our ongoing investment to provide our card members with the simplicity and innovative features they expect from us. The number of enrollments in this feature has already surpassed our goal for the full year. ","Our new alert features is one element of our continued investment in technology. As a direct bank differentiation and technology is critically important for us. Our innovative features like Freeze It and our new alert service further differentiate Discover in a competitive marketplace. The appeal of these features was recognized by JD Power last quarter when our mobile app was ranked highest in customer satisfaction among all U.S. credit card companies. We continue to invest in new digital and mobile capabilities that enhance customer experience as well as advanced analytics and machine learning technologies that will provide a sustainable credit and operating efficiency benefits. ","Turning to credit for a moment, while credit costs have risen, our performance remains largely in line with our expectations and our card portfolio loss rate remains below the industry average. The prime consumer remains healthy, buoyed by a robust labor market, rising home prices and manageable debt service levels. The Federal Reserve recently released its survey of consumer finances which serve medium debt to income and payment to income ratios at their lowest levels since the early 2000s. Moreover, the share of heavily indebted consumers those whose payment to income ratios above 40% fell to its lowest level since 2001. I would add that in October, consumer sentiment reached its highest level in well over a decade. The U.S. consumer continues to feel positive about future prospects for their personal finances and employment. ","Given our commitment to growing prime receivables it makes great sense for us to continue to drive quality loan growth because the economic and competitive environment remains conducive to creating long-term shareholder value. Of course, we remain attentive to emerging credit data and in fact over the last year have reduced exposure by cutting back open lines in some segments of the card portfolio. ","Mark will talk more about it later, but one area where we\u2019re taking similar significant action is in personal loans, where we\u2019re scaling back the volume of origination sourced through broad market channels. ","While the environment remains favorable for most, a number of our customers were unfortunately affected by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. For our 1.8 million customers in areas most impacted by the hurricane, we offer a range of proactive benefits such as suspensions of late fees and collection activities. Additionally, we and our customers provided support to these communities by donating $3 million to the American Red Cross. ","In summary our differentiated approach and relentless focus on serving customers will continue to drive strong revenue and loan growth along with a robust return on equity. I\u2019ll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark?","Mark Graf ","Thanks David and good evening everyone. I\u2019ll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide four. Our 10% revenue growth in the third quarter was driven primarily by a combination of strong loan growth and margin expansion. The increase in provision is largely consistent with ongoing supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well as the seasoning of our last several years of loan growth. The only exception to this is contained in a limited portion of the personal loan book, that we alluded to last quarter. ","Operating expenses rose 6% year-over-year as we continue to invest for growth. EPS was up $0.03 to a $1.59, including coincidently $28 million of income tax benefits in both the current and the prior year. And in terms of returns, it was once again a very strong quarter as evidenced by our return on equity of 22%. ","Turning to slide five. Total loans increased 9% over the prior year driven by 9% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise revolving balances drove much of this increase, spurred by strong sales growth particularly among revolvers. Promotional balances contributed to growth as well. ","We also achieved strong loan growth in our other primary lending products. Personal loans increased 18% from the prior year, thanks to active consumer engagement with our simplified application experience and expanded digital presence, this growth rate is down 4 percentage points from last quarter, as a result of our tightening of certain underwriting standards in our unsolicited channel and we expect that these changes will lead to a further deceleration in personal loan growth in the coming quarters. ","Private student loan balances rose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 11% year-over-year. As a result of expanded marketing efforts with a focus on digital contest, we are on track for another year of record originations in our student loan business in 2017. ","Moving to the results from our payments network, on the right-hand side of slide five, you can see that proprietary volume rose 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in active Discover card accounts. In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume grew at a faster rate during the third quarter with an increase of 17%. Diners Club volume rose 9% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises. And finally, Network Partners volume rose 15% driven largely by AribaPay [ph] volume.","Moving to revenue on slide six. Net interest income increased $225 million or 12% from a year ago, driven by a combination of higher loan balances, market rates and our balance sheet positioning. Total non-interest income was down $1 million as higher discount and interchange revenue was more than offset by increased rewards expense resulting from greater customer engagement in the rotating 5% category we opted to feature this quarter. ","I would remind you that we have previously said that you should expect an uptick in our rewards rate in the second half of this year and this result is completely consistent with our full year guidance of a 126 to 128 basis points. ","As shown on slide seven, our net interest margin rose 29 basis points from the prior year and 17 basis points sequentially ending the quarter at 10.28%. relative to the third quarter of 2016, higher prime rate and a lower proportion of student loans bolstered the margin offset in part by higher charge-offs and an increase in promotional balances. ","Total loan yield increased 33 basis points from a year ago to 12.15%, driven by a 30-basis point increase in card yield, and a 43-basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases partially offset by higher charge-offs and a shift portfolio mix towards promotional balances drove card yields higher. Higher short-term interest rates were the driver of the increase in student loan yields. ","On the liability side of the balance sheet, we once again generated robust growth in our consumer deposits. Average balances increased $3.4 billion or 10% year-over-year. Consumer deposit rates moved slightly higher during the third quarter, rising 8 basis points sequentially and 11 basis points year-over-year. We expect deposit betas will continue to rise gradually toward more normalized levels with any future rate rise.","Turning to slide eight, operating expenses rose $53 million or 6% year-over-year. Employee compensation and benefits was higher driven primarily by higher headcount to support business growth and compliance activities, as well as higher average salaries. Professional fees were also higher as we invested in the technology initiatives that David spoke of earlier. I would point out that even as we made these investments in growth, our expense discipline and strong revenue growth produce positive operating leverage of 4% in the current period. ","I\u2019ll now discuss credit results on slide nine. David highlighted for you the assistance we provided to customers in areas affected by the hurricane. While we provided relief to these customers by not aging their accounts, we did from an accounting point of view accelerate the recognition of $17 million of likely charge-offs in hurricane affected areas. That said, the ultimate impact on the hurricane maybe somewhat greater than this amount, primarily driven by the more recent and severe impact of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico. ","Total net charge-offs rose 61 basis points from the prior year and fell 8 basis points sequentially. As we spoken about in the last several quarters supply driven credit normalization along with the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years have been the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase charge-offs. ","Credit card net charge-offs rose 63 basis points year-over-year and fell 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Private student loan net charge-offs rose 44 basis points year-over-year and 29 basis points sequentially. The increase in student loan net charge-off rate is principally due to seasoning of a large vintage. ","Personal loan net charge-offs increased 56 basis points in the prior year, and 1 basis point sequentially. As we indicated last quarter, we\u2019ve identify a sub-segment of the broad market personal loan book that\u2019s not performing in line with expectations and taken actions to curtail those originations. This quarter, you can see the impact in our reserve build. In future quarters, the personal loan net charge-off rate will rise as these loans flow through the charge-offs. We expect the future exposure of this sub-segment will not exceed $30 million over the remaining lives of the assets. ","Of course, for the total personal loan portfolio, the net charge-off rate will also be impacted by the denominator effect associate with the pulling back on originations in the effective segment. 30-day delinquency rates were up sequentially across all of our primary lending products. Looking at total loan receivables, our 30-day delinquency rate increased 12 basis points sequentially and 26 basis points year-over-year. ","Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio declined 50 basis points sequentially as loan balances grew and we returned $667 million of capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. ","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we may have an opportunity to refinance our existing preferred shares. It currently appears though this would be a beneficial trade. However, if executed it would be diluted in the fourth quarter to the tune of $0.05 to $0.06 per share. This dilution would result from two factors. First, we would have a period of overlapping dividend payments. And second, we would need to take a charge to retain the earnings for the capitalized fees incurred when we issued the existing preferred shares. ","To sum up the quarter on slide 11. We generated 9% total loan growth with significant contributions from all three of our primary lending products. Our consumer deposit business posted equally strong growth at 10%, while deposit betas remained low. With respect to credit, while our charge upgrades have risen static conditions normalized in loan season, it remain below both historical norms and the industry average and we\u2019re continuing to execute on our capital plan with strong loan growth and the leading payout ratio helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels. Our commitment to disciplined profitable growth fueled strong operating performance with 10% revenue growth, NIM expansion and a healthy 22% return on equity. In addition, expenses remain well managed as evidenced by one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. ","That concludes our formal remarks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator Ruth, to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","I was hoping Mark, you could give us a framework for future allowance builds and provisions and the charge off rate as we\u2019re go into 2018, because I know there is a lot going on with the growth inflection that you have seen over the last year and half. Thanks. ","Mark Graf","Yeah, I would say I\u2019m going to stay away from 2018 guidance at this point, Sanjay. I\u2019m going to make you wait until the January call where we talk about the year ahead. I guess what I would say is the provision build that we\u2019re experiencing at this point in time, if we take that small sub-segment of the personal loan book and set it aside, the provision builds we\u2019re seeing is completely consistent with the normalization of credit we\u2019re seeing from the standpoint of that supply side phenomenon we spoken about a number of times as well as the seasoning of the growth that we\u2019re seeing. ","And as we have continued to find ways to drive very strong profitable growth in that prime segment, the 9% loan growth this quarter, it will drive increases in provision. I mean there is just a mathematical equation that takes place there. What I would tell you is any place we have seen the returns on that growth not meet our expectations we\u2019ve demonstrated the willingness to fill back on that. We did it in the aggregator channel in the card space a few years ago when the cost of acquisition got too high. And you have heard us talk about it in this broad market segment at the personal loan business where credit costs are running a little bit high quite honestly. So, I think the discipline is there such that we feel comfortable. While provision expense has been growing it\u2019s been growing for the right reasons as we\u2019re investing and building shareholder value for the long-term. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And my follow up on NIM. I guess what drove the sequential move higher on a year-over-year basis, if you got what I mean. And I was wondering if there was any hurricane impact in the revenue yields. ","Mark Graf","Yeah there hasn\u2019t been a significant amount of hurricane impact that we can identify in the revenue line at this point in time Sanjay. In terms of the walk of the margin from Q2 to Q3, it depends already because it\u2019s a bunch of things this time around. The biggest piece is market rates contributed about 7 basis points give or take. Credit contributed about 2 basis points, the receivables rate contributed about 2, the funding rate contributed about 2, and then the mix of receivables was about another 2 and funding mix was about another 2. So, if you add those all up, you get that 17 basis-point quarter-over-quarter increase in the margin. So, it feels again very strong. We\u2019re benefiting from that positioning of the balance sheet to be asset-sensitive. And then, I think we\u2019re also seeing just good prudent management of the funding of the assets and the nature of the assets that are coming on as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Ryan Nash","I guess, just a different question on the reserve build this quarter. Can you maybe talk about how much of the reserve build was due to growth versus how much was from credit normalization? And I guess related to charge-offs, if you look at the breakdown of the 60 that you are up year-over-year, can you maybe contextualize how much of that is from the supply side seasoning versus maybe losses that you are seeing in the back book? Thanks.","David Nelms","A lot in there, Ryan, I\u2019ll try and touch on it all and I will give you credit for one quick follow-up, just in case I miss any of it. I would say a couple of different things. First of all, the primary driver of the provisioning is the growth. That has been and continues to be the primary driver of the provisioning but then normalization factor is material. I don\u2019t want to downplay that too much, just to be clear. I would say, if you think about the nature of build, if you take glimpse at the supplement which you can see is about a $111 million of that build was specifically related to the card business. There was an outsized build in personal loans to tune of $34 million, $35 million this time around, reflecting that small book that we talked about a second ago and getting ahead and getting a provisioning for that out of the way. And then, I would say the student loans piece of the equation, you saw uptick in the charge-off rate this quarter. That\u2019s really related to that seasoning we talked about earlier, that higher vintage as well as we had a conversion that we went through on the student loan system on to our new platform, bringing [ph] the course to quarter end, probably weren\u2019t as diligent about working delinquencies for a couple of days in there too, probably drove a little bit of that delta is my guess. But, if you look at the reserve rate there, you can see it\u2019s up only 3 basis points. So, at the end of the day, I would say, it really continues to be where we are seeing the strongest growth with the exception of the DTL [ph] portfolio is where we are seeing the greatest provisioning.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And maybe if I could just ask a quick question on personal. You saw loan growth on a year-over-year basis come in at about 400 basis points, yet it does look like the quarter-over-quarter growth did increase, maybe there was some seasonality in there. So, could you maybe just expand on your comments about pulling back and how do you expect growth rates to progress in that business? Thanks.","David Nelms","Yes. I would expect you would see growth rates continue to slow further in that business, as a result of the actions we have taken and continue to take in that affected segment. The good news is, it\u2019s a very defined and identifiable piece of the book and it\u2019s not gigantic. So, I think from that standpoint, I am not overly concerned about it in any way.","I would expect though you would see growth rates continue to decelerate in that regard. I don\u2019t think we are permanently abandoning the sub segments in question. I think we just need to figure out a way to go back to looking at them in a constructive fashion. And that will take us a little bit of time to look at models and do some further work.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good evening. Mark, we saw the year-over-year change in your delinquency rate to decelerate last month. Was there a hurricane benefit underlying that improvement or would we have seen an improvement anyway?","Mark Graf","You would have seen a bit of a seasonal improvement any way. I would say\u2026","Bill Carcache","I\u2019m sorry. I mean, year-over-year. Sorry, sorry, Mark. I mean, year-over-year change\u2026","Mark Graf","Okay, got it. On a year-over-year change, yes, you would have seen benefit there is the honest answer, absent to hurricanes. I do think the rate of delinquency formation has slowed again with the exception of that small sub segment in the personal loans. Just to be clear, we\u2019re carving that one out here. But delinquency rate formation has definitely slowed. And absent the hurricane impact, which was relatively modest for us, you would have seen improvement.","Bill Carcache","Okay. And as a follow-up, your reserve rate in card increased to 3.29% this quarter that now exceeds net charge-off rate of 2.87% -- or sorry, 2.8% by the greatest amount that we\u2019ve seen and allow. So, should we start to see the rate of increase in that reserve rate start to slow here, particularly driven that deceleration in DQ formations that we just talked about?","Mark Graf","What I would say, Bill, is that the way I think about it, when I parse it up, is charge-offs are kind of looking what\u2019s already happened, reserves are really looking what we expect to happen. And while the rate of delinquency formation has slowed, the rate of growth has increased. The rate of growth in the absolutely underlying level off assets. So, if we\u2019re going to have a higher level of assets going through that seasoning process with seasoning being the greatest piece of the driver, part of that is what you\u2019re seeing there. So, you\u2019re seeing that increase to reflect that increased growth that we\u2019re seeing roll-on quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter. So, it\u2019s not the 9% this quarter just a driver, it\u2019s the stronger growth from a couple of quarters ago, as that comes up into the seasoning curve, that\u2019s really driving that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Rick Shane","Mark, look, I understand not wanting to provide guidance on provision into 2018. But I\u2019d love to think about it a little bit more conceptually, which is, can you help us think about the lag between when loans are added and the loss curve and when you would be reserving for that. Given the steady loan growth throughout the year, that might help us think about how to model provision into 2018?","Mark Graf","Yes. From a pure seasoning impact as opposed to that normalization element of it, Rick, I absolutely can. So, the way I think about it is, you think about a normal seasoning curve for a normal vintage or card loans, you typically tend to take peaks losses about 24 months after you originate that vintage, give or take. So, think about a bell curve that starts at zero losses, it increases to peak about 24 months out and then it drop offs on the back end of that to stabilize at the portfolio loss rate somewhere three years or shortly thereafter. It\u2019s kind of really the way to think about the way the card loan, the seasoning impact of the card loan would work.","Student loans interestingly enough follow a very similar pattern; it\u2019s just that vintage curve doesn\u2019t kick in until the loan comes out of deferral. So, student graduates or drops out. You have a six months deferral period; that deferral period ends, that\u2019s when that basically that same curve would kick in with peak losses occurring 24 months thereafter. And if you think about it, it\u2019s logical, because the biggest losses are taken when a student comes out and is unemployed or underemployed. So, it\u2019s pretty logical process.","Personal loans follow a similar curve, they tend to peak just a tad bit earlier, maybe kind of like 18 to 20 months out is really the way to think about them, but again, a very similar process. So, as you think about loan growth, it\u2019s really that area under that peak of the curve you\u2019re providing for. And every year since the crisis, our vintage of new credit has been larger than the one from the year that preceded it. So, while it\u2019s not mathematically correct, [indiscernible] in the crowd like me, what I would say is [ph] visualize it as the area under the peak of that curve is growing. You have a larger and larger and large vintage coming into replace it at 12 months to replace the one that\u2019s falling off at 36.","Rick Shane","You\u2019ve done a nice job painting that picture. And just to refine us a little bit, because you\u2019re reserving 12-month in front of that, the reserve build actually starts around month 12.","Mark Graf","That is -- it actually begins before month 12, but it kicks in, in earnest somewhere around month 8, 9, 10, somewhere in that range as you climb the peak of that curve. That\u2019s correct. So, if you really think about it just mathematically, the absolute peak is going to be somewhere between month, call 18 and month 30, right, is when you\u2019re going to have the bulk of the losses under the peak of that curve be recognized.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","DonFandetti","David, you talked a little bit about this early in the remarks, but it stuck, investors continue to just ask why is Discover growing so much in their card portfolio at this point in the cycle? You clearly have a lot of excess capital and you see good returns as competitors have pulled back. Can you just drill down a little bit because sometimes I have a hard time answering that question?","David Nelms","I would say, for one thing, the market is growing faster now than it was certainly two years ago, three years ago. And one year ago, it\u2019s probably when we saw the really absolute peak of competitive intensity, particularly around cash reward programs. And so, that impacted some of our response rates a year ago and it also impacted where we invested because some things were getting just too expensive. And that\u2019s actually our cost per account has dropped even with -- at the margin tighter credit this year than last year. So, our growth rate basically, it\u2019s almost as same store sales kind of thing a little bit, because last year it was when we were -- had really slowed growth. And so, we\u2019re looking back at that period. Competitors have pulled back. We\u2019ve been consistent, maybe a little bit more aggressive with some of our new features and so on. But it\u2019s appealing to consumers. So, there is no dramatic new product launch, but we had a lot of new feature launches and the combination. And it\u2019s not just new accounts. We had a little bit more attrition a year ago, given some of those over the top and often promotional offers, specifically targeting cash back bonus.","Don Fandetti","Got it. That makes sense. And then, one of the large banks actually this quarter were saying how they were shifting acquisitions a little bit away from transactors more to revolvers. And it\u2019s hard to -- you see some plus and minus data points on competition. Do you still feel like competition is kind of peaked in your business or?","David Nelms","Well, it\u2019s still the best thing going in banking. So, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as anything but robust competition. But, it was over the top a year ago. So, I think some of the craziness probably has passed. And we frankly couldn\u2019t really understand why everyone else seems to be going after transactors and paying up higher rewards than interchange. And if you have no interest income, you can\u2019t make that up on volume. I mean, it\u2019s by definition a money-losing preposition and I think a few competitors properly have noticed that. It is focusing on prime revolvers has been our strategy over a decade. So, we\u2019re continuing to pursue that consistent strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","Chris Brendler","Hi, thanks. Good evening. The NIM walk through was really helpful. I had my pencil ready, but I was hoping if you could, Mark, just comment briefly on how those will trend going forward directionally. I can imagine that they\u2019re all positive as we continue on. Obviously, market rates are going higher but can you talk about the funding rate and the loan mix and the funding mix? How does that look going forward, if you could give us directional help that would be great.","Mark Graf","Sure. So, I think at the beginning of the year we gave NIM guidance on the full year to be, I think this is slightly higher and I think I defined that as probably 15 or so basis points. Full year last year was 9.99. I would tell you, I would expect our fourth quarter this year to have an increase in NIM but not by very much. So, you\u2019d have some further expansion but really more modest in nature, so maybe you close out the year at 20, 21, 22 basis points higher than that 9.99 on a full year basis reported last year. So, it would be the real way to think about it.","We continue to be positioned in an asset sensitive fashion and plus or minus 2% is kind of what we target in this environment asset-sensitivity, and feel really good about the work that the treasury group has done to get the balance sheet position that way but also that the deposits business is done continuing to put up pretty strong growth in that channel, which is our least market rate sensitive channel. So, feel good about the trajectory at NIM.","Chris Brendler","Okay. And then, a follow-up on personal loans. I may have missed it. Did you size the portion of the portfolio that you have decided you don\u2019t look at this point? And also, related, do you expect personal loans to continue to grow or it was just negative potentially?","Mark Graf","So, I would say, we would expect personal loans to continue to grow. I would guess, as a result of pullback, you might see a slightly smaller vintage overall next year than you will see this year. But on balance, the affected portfolio is really small. We didn\u2019t size it but if I did, it would be low single digit percentage points. It\u2019s a very small portion of the book. It is principally behind us at this point in time in terms of the provisioning impact. I think what we said earlier in the prepared remarks is there is probably $30 million at economic risk over the remaining lives of those assets associated with them.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","John Hecht","Yes. Thanks very much. I guess following a little bit on sort of Rick Shane\u2019s questions about the nuances of credit. I guess, you guys are about the fourth quarter, you are entering the fourth quarter where you are starting to see accelerated growth. I\u2019m wondering, at this point in time, can you tell us, how you look at the loss content of the latest vintage, this year\u2019s vintage versus last year\u2019s vintage, say? And how you look at that both on a gross and net basis, because it looks like recoveries have come down a little bit as well?","David Nelms","A lot in there, I\u2019ll try and answer simply and just kind of say, if you think about that vintage curve we spoke about earlier, in the card book that curve still peaking lower than we have seen it in a pre-crisis environment. But what I would say is, it is every year successively getting closer and closer and closer to that normalized vintage seasoning process. So that\u2019s the way I would think about it, the vintages are performing better than pre-crisis historic norms, but the gap to that pre-crisis historic norm continues to shrink every year. Kind of consistent if you think about what we said. We said that loss rates have been unsustainably low. We continue to see opportunities to put things on the books that season below normalized expectations.","And as David alluded to earlier in his response to earlier question, I think that\u2019s the key to compounding value in a lend-centric model. We don\u2019t really charge fees, it\u2019s kind of inconsistent with our business model; that will be leg one of the stool. Margin is already pushing 10\/30. So, I mean, I don\u2019t think, it\u2019s a lot more produced [ph] in margin probably. Expenses, we\u2019ve got the lowest efficiency ratio of any of the general purpose issuer. So, I think the third leg of the stool, expenses is in pretty shape. So that fourth leg of the stool is how you compound value with quality loan growth. And I think our pullback in DTL [ph] this year, our pull back in card growth a few years ago demonstrates that when we don\u2019t see the quality we need to have, we will pull back on that loan growth. But to the extent we can put quality on the books that makes sense that\u2019s good for shareholders, we believe it\u2019s the right thing to do in this environment.","John Hecht","And second question, you guys talked about and we\u2019ve heard this quarter commentary through others that everybody is expecting deposit betas to move up. So, I\u2019m wondering, can you just talk about, the tenure of the duration. Where have you been focused on issuing deposits and how might that impact the overall betas especially next year?","Mark Graf","Yes. So, I think we are particularly focused on the indeterminate maturities. We find those to be the stickiest of all of our deposit base. So, I think that\u2019s an area that we tend to pay an awful lot of essentially to. As we think about the retail CD product, I would say, we tend to move around a bit there and we tend to emphasize those products that are the greatest need and the funding profile, given upcoming maturities and other things we look at as we look to stagger out and stack the funding profile. And then, if you think about the brokered CD product, some of the suite products that we access as well, those really get aspiration. Most of those things we tend to focus well out of the curve, because they are one of our most cost effective solutions as rate issuer to getting duration in the funding profile.","John Hecht","So, taking all that, is the duration now consistent with what it was, say, six months ago?","Mark Graf","It\u2019s a little longer actually.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Chris Donat","Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that balance transfers are one source of growth. I was wondering if you could -- I know, in the past you\u2019ve done this, you\u2019ve quantified the amount of your portfolio that is balance transfers. It looks to me like the amount of balance transfers might have been up by 20% year-on-year. But anyway, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how big they are in your loan mix?","Mark Graf","No. I mean, I think when you look at the card book in general that\u2019s a pretty good guesstimate. It\u2019s somewhere right in that range, actually a hair below. We would have a 19 handle on it, would be the way to think about it. And they continue to be, as we look at them a very good way, not only to attract new customers but also to reengage legacy customers who\u2019ve chosen to deprioritize us in their senior wallet, get them back active again with the product. So, we\u2019ve got pretty disciplined process around the returns on that and they have continued to produce great returns for us. So, your guesstimate is pretty good.","Chris Donat","I hope I qualify then as a [indiscernible], Mark. And then, wanted to ask something maybe a little forward-looking. And David, I don\u2019t know if you -- how much you\u2019ll opine on it. But with the Supreme Court deciding that they\u2019re going to rehear or hear the MX case against the -- brought by the Ohio Attorney General. Just how you think about your discount rate, if in environment where merchants would be allowed this year? I\u2019m imagining that you would not -- I think it\u2019s a phrased used before actually, steering pilots, that you might do something like that. But you\u2019re not going to jump in whole hog and you\u2019d only do something if the cut in discount fee would be more than offset obviously by a pick-up in volume. However should we think about what steering might mean for you strategically from your discount pricing perspective?","David Nelms","I think that -- I think it\u2019s really premature to comment on this. It would be speculative. We\u2019ll see what happens. And if there are is an actual change, then I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have more comments after that.","Chris Donat","Okay. I\u2019ll be patient then. ","David Nelms","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Couple of follow-ups here. One is just as we\u2019re thinking about reward cost, I know you mentioned second half of the year is little bit higher. I think that\u2019s a seasonal pattern, but we\u2019ve also seen a little bit of pullback in some of the competitive dynamics around rewards. Could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about your rewards offering, where you feel you are in your lifecycle of the current rewards that you have out there and give us a sense as to what you\u2019re thinking going forward?","Mark Graf","I\u2019ll let David speak to the lifecycle comment, but I will I\u2019ll speak directly to the kind of what we\u2019re thinking, what we\u2019re seeing. So, the third quarter was a particularly attractive quarter in terms of 5% rotating category. Betsy, we chose to run restaurants in that quarter. Whenever throughout the year we choose to feature restaurants, we tend to see a very high level of engagement with that because it\u2019s pretty easy to max out in that category, spending $1,500 over the course of three months. So, that would be the driver of what you saw in that quarter. This quarter, what you\u2019ve got is principally Amazon is the big driver. We typically tend to do that as a fourth quarter promotion around the holiday season. It tends to also be more costly than what you would have seen really in the first half of the year. So, I would say, based on the level of engagement we\u2019re seeing right now, we\u2019ve been running these programs for a while; we\u2019re generally pretty good at getting our arms around where we think we\u2019re going come in. I am not losing any sleep whatsoever about coming in certainly in line with that 126 to 128 guidance.","David Nelms","And Betsy, I would say that while there still will be some upward bias going forward as we continue to have a higher mix of Discover it customers versus discover more customers in the portfolio. We really kept our discipline a year ago. And so, what you are seeing is, if the competitive intensity slowed just a bit in this category, we stayed the course and we are seeing the benefit with the better marketing results and less attrition as some of the crazy stuff comes away. Our absolute -- my guess is, we\u2019re probably 50 basis points or more below a number of cash back competitors and in terms of cost. And so, I feel it\u2019s a very sustainable place to be and we\u2019re just happy that we\u2019re able to drive revenue and stay the course.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then, just separately, Mark, you mentioned about the potential to refi the press in 4Q. Could you just give us a sense as to what\u2019s going to drive your go, no-go decision? And then, what the benefit is to EPS? I know you outlined the healthy EPS in the fourth quarter but the forward ongoing benefit, if you could speak to that as well?","Mark Graf","Yes. So, what would drive the go, no-go decision would obviously market conditions Betsy and just having an open window, where we didn\u2019t have something that would cause us to not be able to issue; some type of a corporate event or corporate news or something can also end up closing windows. I would say, at this point in time, I don\u2019t have in front of me the full run rate EPS impacts. What I would say just on a pure coupon basis, the last numbers I saw would show we benefit at least 100 basis points in the coupon. So, it\u2019s a pretty significant pickup in benefit. The first call date that we have available to us is December 1, on the existing pref. And so, we\u2019re studying it intensely, and obviously keep your eyes on a Bloomberg and if we end up doing something, you will see it there first.","Operator","Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the kind of the tax drove the loan growth in the card business. I mean, has it primarily been existing customer? As you mentioned a couple of questions ago about the promotional rate piece, I mean how much of it is coming from new customers and kind of any other details you would be willing to provide?","Mark Graf","I\u2019ll give you some pretty concrete data on that one, Moshe. I would say from my perspective couple of different things. This quarter, it\u2019s about 50-50 from new customers and from the legacy back book. We view that -- we like to keep that bouncing somewhere between, call it 30-70, 70-30; 50-50 sounds just about perfect, if you could always end up there. It tells me that the customer is -- the new customers are coming on board and seeing value and the offering, it also tells us that the legacy back book customer is choosing to continue engaging with the Discover product on top of the wallet fashion. ","So both of those are critically important because in the long run, our existing customers will die. Not to sound morose, but they will. So, you have to attract the new customers. By the same token, if you just have a revolving door trying to get new customers, because your legacy customers disengage, you have a problem. So, feel really good about the health there. I would say by far the way the biggest driver of the volume growth this time around for both categories was standard merchandise spend, Moshe. So, yes, promos are piece of it. We\u2019ve actually used promos a little bit more aggressively to stimulate the back book, but even there standard merch spend is a big piece.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Follow-up, I guess particularly since Discover is responsible for couple of the large personal loan portfolios that are out there in the industry, maybe just a little more detail about the -- what distinguish these customers that you kind of decide -- I know, it\u2019s a small -- single-digit percentage. But, where they at one end or the other of credit spectrum where they acquire in a particular channel? What brought them to your attention\u2026","Mark Graf","Yes. You got to be a little bit quiet on that notion for competitive reasons. We really don\u2019t want to say specifically it was exactly this? I think what we have said is, it was the broad market channel where we see these folks. It wasn\u2019t a cross market, a cross sold channel, so we highlight that. The other thing, I think, we have said not on the call today, but we mentioned it earlier in the quarter, so I would highlight that again, is I think, we said, one specific factor, we\u2019ve seen, it there was a tag of underperformances where somebody already had taken out another personal loan. So that was one characteristic [multiple speakers] would be one piece. Beyond that, I would give you comfort in saying, the size of the book here that\u2019s affected is pretty darn small. Again, I think, I said earlier it didn\u2019t size, but if we did, it would be low single digit percentages, the overall book. And we think we have the issues largely behind us and certainly we have it ring fenced. But for competitive reasons, I don\u2019t think we want to say exactly it was this and this and this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Bruce","My question first question relates to growth. I guess, there has been a lot of discussion around folks pulling back and the market becoming a little less competitively intense. You look around and at least most of the large issuers are still growing well above what the industry is. I\u2019m always little perplexes to exactly kind of where this growth is coming from. If it\u2019s the cut back has been, maybe the lower end of the prime and this is just really kind of the reengagement of revolving credit by prime borrowers, if there is any kind of change in the composition of what the market looks like today?","David Nelms","No. It\u2019s a fairly, I mean the top six issuers represent a high percentage of the total business. So, I would say -- you average them together, you\u2019re going to get pretty close to the industry average. So, I\u2019d say, few people have slowed down their growth. But, where we\u2019ve seen the bigger change is probably how much marketing and what the marketing was. And frankly, I think there were some crazy offers out there that was leading to a year ago, a lot more shifting of people from one issuer to another. So, it was maybe a little bit of zero sum game where people were just paying more rewards and moving balances between them. And so, I think that if we look at the level of what the bidding for terms on the internet marketing are, it\u2019s come down this year versus the year ago, direct mail volumes, particularly in the cash back segment. And the sub-prime segment, which we\u2019re not in have had probably the two greatest reductions in new account offers. And then, you\u2019ve also seen some well publicized headlines and some people that have pulled back from some offers that I think they\u2019ve actually admitted were too rich.","One of the things that happened a year ago is there was a lot of -- lot going on in the warehouse club space. And you had both Costco, the people that were losing that relationship were fighting hard; and the people who were gaining that relationship were fighting hard. Visa was accepted at Sam\u2019s Club for the first time. And that particularly impacted us, because at one point it wasn\u2019t exclusive. So, some of those headwinds have abated for us. And that probably helps. It\u2019s not that the market has slowed, actually the market has kind of kept up and that makes it easier for us to grow, but there is less shifting and our market is more effective relative to the others.","Mark Graf","Yes, we actually tightened our credit criteria for cards at the end of last year. So, we\u2019re actually upgrading a tighter box down than we were last year.","Ken Bruce","Right. That\u2019s -- we hear that basic tenet from others as well. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s a little curious as why everybody is growing faster today than it would appear the average is, but I understand David\u2019s point, there is a couple of high profile slow growers out there. My follow-up question I guess relate to little bit to -- as I follow up to the comment around the personal loan risk layering where you saw. You referenced something similar a couple of quarters ago on the credit card with late stage delinquencies, you\u2019ve seen higher levels of indebtedness. Can you maybe kind of step back and give us any sense as to whether you think there is parts of the consumer business whether your own or just can more broadly that you see this increase in leverage that\u2019s occurring?","Mark Graf","I think the increase in leverage is really across the consumer spectrum broadly. I think it\u2019s most prominent in the sub-prime space where we don\u2019t really play. But if you think about it in the prime revolver space, it was a Fed study out there. I don\u2019t know exactly where to point to say number exactly when it was. But it basically took a look at coming out of the crisis indexing levels of consumer indebtedness to one, and then kind of showing by product what those levels are at today. And I think card was like at 1.06. I think autos, personal loans and federal student loans were the principal drivers of that increase in leverage. But I think it\u2019s a driver when we look at our portfolio across the board, our incidence rates that is the number of account -- expresses the number of accounts close to number of balances. Our incidence rates to delinquencies are darn near flat across the book. We really don\u2019t see meaningful movements there. What we\u2019re seeing is increases in severities because when a customer does go bad, they\u2019re more indebted and therefore higher losses. So, maybe the arithmetic way to think about it would be the probabilities of default really haven\u2019t changed much. The loss given the default has changed just as consumers are carrying more leverage. But, it\u2019s still below the levels that you would have seen pre-crisis. And meaningfully, the debt to income ratios, the consumers are in far better shape now, they don\u2019t have exploding arms that are going to be ticking time bombs. The levers they have built up is more largely a fixed rate product. So, it feels, while the leverage is there, it feels healthier.","David Nelms","The thing I would add from industry perspective is a year ago, we were seeing very high growth rates in auto loans and that\u2019s really flattened out from last year to this year. We have been seeing several years of rapid growth on federal student loans and that has flattened out. Credit cards hadn\u2019t grown that much on loans, single digit levels, but credit card lines outstanding have been really and quite rapidly for a couple of years as people were chasing some of those transactors in particular. But this year, we have seen very flat, total cumulative credit card loans for the industry. And so, I think all of those things show that there was kind of a recovery after some releveraging, some recovery on both supply and demand for a couple of years and then this year it\u2019s really flattened out.","Ken Bruce","Thank you for your comments.","Mark Graf","Bruce, are we ready to wrap","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","David Nelms","Hey, thanks everybody for your interest, your questions and of course, we are available for any follow up that you have. Thanks. Good night.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","Operator","Good afternoon, my name is Salacia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2018 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services","Thank you, Salacia. Welcome, everyone, to our call this afternoon. As always, I'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.","Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report, and in our 10-K and first quarter and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.","In the second quarter 2018 earnings materials, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information. And we also explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's call.","Our call will include remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, covering second quarter highlights and developments; and then Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And then, as Salacia said, we will have time for Q&As following the formal comments. Appreciate it if you'd limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate everyone during the time that we have.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In our second quarter, we earned $669 million after tax or $1.91 per share, generating a return on equity of 25%. This performance reflects a simple strategy, focus on the customer, maintain a disciplined approach to credit, and invest for long-term profitable growth.","And as you can see from our results, effective execution of this strategy continues to generate outstanding returns. These returns primarily reflect strong revenue growth, which itself is a function of outstanding receivables growth, particularly in the card business.","Over time, we've invested in brand advertising, in marketing analytics, in superior service and in enhancements to our rewards offerings. And together, these investments continue to drive profitable loan and revenue growth from a balanced mix of new accounts and existing cardholders.","Turning to our other lending products. In student loans, we are just entering the peak season and early origination activity looks good, and it's consistent with our internal projections. In personal loans, competition continues to intensify.","Just to illustrate, the industry sent more direct mail for personal loans in the first half of this year than it sent for credit cards. And industry pricing and credit standards seem to be focused more on near-term growth than long-term returns.","As a result, we are continuing to cut back on origination activity, as we see less opportunity for profitable growth in this portfolio in the near-term. In fact, we expect personal loans receivables to be flat to potentially down over the second half of this year.","Turning to credit, performance remained strong with charge-offs flat and delinquencies down 15 basis points on a sequential basis. This reflects a number of factors. First, we've maintained our disciplined approach to underwriting.","Second, we've seen meaningful benefit from our investments in advanced analytics, modeling and machine learning. And finally, the strength of the U.S. economy has certainly helped. In addition to our Direct Banking business, in Payment Services, good business momentum drove a 14% increase in volume and an 11% increase in income before tax on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, we returned $656 million of capital through dividends and share repurchases, and have raised our quarterly common stock dividend by another $0.05, or 14%.","In summary, this was another very solid quarter, led by the terrific performance of our card business. Looking at the economic environment for prime consumers, all indications suggest that economic conditions remain favorable. Overall, we feel very good about our ability to continue to generate strong risk-adjusted returns with a continued tailwind from the economy enhancing our ability to deliver profitable growth.","I'll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Thanks, David, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. Looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue growth of 8% this quarter was driven primarily by strong loan growth.","The increase in provision was largely consistent with ongoing supply-driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well as the seasoning of loan growth. Operating expenses rose 8% year-over-year as a result of the investments David alluded to in support of growth and new capabilities.","Turning to slide 5, total loans increased 9% over the prior year, led by 10% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise balances drove much of this increase, spurred by accelerating sales growth.","Promotional balances were a modest contributor to our strong performance, although balance transfer volume came in above our expectations for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect balance transfer activity to slow and for the mix of promotional balances in the portfolio to gradually decline.","Looking at our other primary lending products, year-over-year growth in personal loans was 5%. And as David said, originations are expected to continue to slow. Private student loan balances rose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 10% year-over-year.","Moving to the results from our Payment segment. On the right-hand side of slide 5, you can see that proprietary volume rose 9% year-over-year, up from 8% last quarter. This increase was driven by two primary factors.","First; a high level of customer engagement with our 5% category, which was supermarkets this quarter. And second, higher gas prices. In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume growth was once again strong this quarter, with 14% higher volume compared to the prior year, driven by both new issuers, as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Diners Club volume rose 8% from the prior year, on strength from newer franchises. And Network Partners volume increased 33%, driven by AribaPay volume.","Moving to Revenue on slide 6, net interest income increased $191 million, or 10% from a year ago, driven by a combination of higher loan balances and higher market rates. Total non-interest income was down $7 million, due to a decline in net discount and interchange revenue.","Gross discount and interchange revenue grew in line with sales. But higher rewards costs more than offset that impact due to higher customer engagement in the 5% promotional rewards category. As I mentioned earlier, this was driven by our decision to feature groceries this quarter.","We remain comfortable with our expectation for the rewards rate for the year. As shown on slide 7, our net interest margin rose 10 basis points from the prior year, and was down 2 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 10.21%.","Relative to the second quarter of last year, the net benefit of a higher prime rate and a favorable shift in funding mix were partially offset by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge-offs. Relative to this year's first quarter, the net benefit of a higher prime rate was more than offset by strong engagement on the part of transactors, and higher promotional balances, which as I noted earlier, are expected to decline as a percentage of the portfolio over the remainder of the year. On balance, we remain comfortable with our outlook for net interest margin for the full year.","Total loan yield increased 30 basis points from a year ago to 12.28% as a result of a 22-basis-point increase in card yield, and a 60-basis-point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases and a modest increase in the revolve rate lead card yields higher, partially offset by the impact of somewhat larger promotional balances and higher charge-offs.","Higher short-term interest rates drove the increase in student loan yields, where about 60% of the organic portfolio is variable rate in nature. On the liability side of the balance sheet, consumer deposits grew faster than loans, at 12%, up 2 points sequentially. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter, increasing 12 basis points sequentially, and 42 basis points year-over-year. Deposit betas have continued to rise, but at this point remain below our cycle-to date-expectations.","Turning to slide 8, operating expenses rose $72 million from the prior year. Employee compensation and benefits was higher, the result of increased technology and volume-related head count to support business growth as well as higher average salaries.","Marketing expenses were up as a result of greater investment in account acquisition and increased brand advertising. Information processing cost increased due to investments in infrastructure as well as analytic capabilities. We remain comfortable with our operating expense guidance for the full year.","I'll now discuss credit results on slide 9. Total net charge-off rates rose 40 basis points from the prior year, and 2 basis points sequentially. As we've talked about over the last year or so, supply driven credit normalization, along with the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years, have been the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs.","Credit card net charge-offs rose 40 basis points year-over-year. However, from a sequential perspective, this quarter represented the third consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge-offs. In addition, delinquency formation slowed. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 16 basis points year-over-year, but down 17 basis points sequentially.","Private student loan net charge-offs rose 7 basis points year-over-year, and were flat sequentially. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 79 basis points from the prior year, but fell 6 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus delinquency rate was up 28 basis points year-over-year and 5 basis points sequentially. Taking into account the delinquency trends as well as the competitive conditions, we have chosen to slow personal loan originations as David noted earlier.","Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 30 basis points sequentially as loan balances grew. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 118%. On June 28, in conjunction with the receipt of our CCAR non-objection, we announced our capital plan for the four quarters ending June 30, 2019.","Specifically, we disclosed planned share repurchases of $1.85 billion over the next four quarters, as well as a $0.05 per share increase in our quarterly common stock dividend. We remain focused on efficiently deploying our shareholders' capital by driving profitable and disciplined asset growth and returning excess capital via dividends and share repurchases.","To sum up the quarter on slide 11, we generated 9% total loan growth and a 25% return on equity. Our consumer deposit business also posted robust growth of 12%, while deposit rates increased 42 basis points year-over-year.","With respect to credit, while our charge-off rates have risen, as credit conditions normalize and loan growth seasons, performance remains consistent with both our expectations and our return targets. And we're continuing to execute on our capital plan with strong loan growth and a leading payout ratio helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels. In conclusion, we're pleased with our performance this quarter, and are confident in our outlook for the balance of the year.","That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Salacia to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. David or Mark, maybe you could talk about the personal loan product and your decision to slow it down. What's the nature of the competition entering the market? Is it, kind of, fintech players or is it more traditional players? And how do you envision it playing out in terms of getting back in if you wanted to?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, first, we're not in any way exiting that business. It's a great business, and we basically need to pull back the growth to maintain our returns, but we're still putting on new accounts, just, probably it will be fewer than needed to replace attrition by the end of this year.","And I would say that a lot of it is fintechs. I don't know \u2013 I guess you'd call Goldman, I don't know if you really called him a fintech, but you've got some people like them that haven't traditionally been in the business that are also entering.","It is by far the easiest product to enter, a lot easier than credit cards or student loans. And we have seen this in past cycles, where people enter, and a lot of times a crisis sorts things \u2013 a credit cycle sorts things out. But I would just say that mainly these new entrants have produced, as I mentioned, more direct mail in the first half of this year than credit cards.","And that market is about 15% the size of credit cards. So, there's a lot going out there. And that impacts cost per account, but also the availability of credit will impact credit, and so to maintain our discipline, we need to selectively tighten and be more selective on how we're marketing.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","And I think, Sanjay, I'd just add to that. I mean, we've been pretty consistent all along, in saying global domination in this business has never made sense, right? It's a business where discipline and humility matter a great deal. And risk-adjusted returns rule the way we think about things at Discover. So it's just time to feather the accelerator a little bit.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I appreciate that. I guess my follow-up question is, obviously, I'm sure you've seen today's announcement of Walmart, sort of, switching issuers. I'm curious if you have any updated views on the private label space, or even the co-brand space if an opportunity presented itself? Maybe you could talk about your appetite to get into that market. And then also, how the backdrop is with the BSA\/AML issue, in terms of making a deal of any sort? Thanks.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. While the private-label business, I think, could fit strategically, I think the entry paths are limited. And I think it's probably unlikely for us, at least in the near-term. What was your second question?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Co-brands.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Co-brands. One of the things we have is the Discover brand. We're not issuing Visa\/Mastercards. We have differentiation. We have leading service, and frankly, optimizing and extending Discover-branded products, I think has shown to produce the highest returns. And we're also outgrowing, at the moment, all those people who actually have co-brand programs.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good evening. Mark, just want to talk a little bit more about the NIM. I know it looks like you came in a little bit lower than expected around some promo activity, but you're keeping the full year guidance. I mean, it implies a nice uptick. I guess I want to just, kind of, get a sense of your confidence there, just given that it can be so variable based on the mix of the portfolio.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, absolutely, I would say, Don, maybe the right place to start is a quick walk to Q1. So if you think about the benefit of the Fed rate increase we saw go through there, just on a pure rate per rate basis point, that was a 10 basis point good guy in the quarter to NIM.","We had 12 basis points of bad guys that were essentially half and half. BT and promo mix in the portfolio coming in higher than we thought it would be, and then a real uptick in transactor volume, which obviously is a good guy on the gross interchange side of the equation and the sales growth side of the equation, so maybe dilutive to margin in that regard, but obviously a good guy elsewhere on the income statement.","Got really good visibility into the BT and the promo mix, already see that coming down, so very comfortable there. Promos right now are about 21% of the book roughly, and we see that declining over the remainder of the year, pretty significantly.","So, again, feel good about that. Transactor volume is obviously the wild card. If we continue to see a stronger level of transactor engagement, that could mute it somewhat, but it would still make its way into the range that we've set out for the full year.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good evening, guys.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Ryan.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Mark, maybe just picking up on the back of that last question, just given your expectations for promos to come down from the 21% level, do you have any thoughts on what that could mean for loan growth?","And David as a follow-up to that, can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing in the competitive environment for loan growth? Are you seeing any changes to competitor behavior, and what do you think it means for loan growth at this point in the cycle?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So from my perspective, Ryan, I'd say we continue to feel good about that 7% to 9% range we've talked about for total loan growth for the year. Card obviously came in above that range. It came in at 10% this quarter, although down somewhat \u2013 still rounded to 10%, but down somewhat from where it was last quarter.","Obviously, with a little less BT and promo volume, we would expect to see some slowing in card loan growth there as we go on through the course of the year, and that's reflected not only in our NIM thoughts for the year, but also our overall financial outlook for the year at this point as well.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And I would say the competitive environment is pretty stable compared to the last two quarters. It's still well off it's \u2013 I guess frothier stage from a year, year and a half ago, and I think generally, I've seen most of the prime competitors just maybe slowing loan growth to the low single digits, if you take out any acquisitions that they might have had, and sales growth, pretty close to where we are. Maybe a touch higher, but this quarter, our sales growth really moved up quite a bit, and we're right there with the other guys on sales.","And I think generally, people \u2013 my take is people started seeing higher rewards cost a year ago, and most recently and started making some adjustments, so we have seen some tapering off of some of the most aggressive rewards programs.","We've seen some taping off of marketing spend and volumes, and that has really helped us with some costs per accounts that look really attractive and our ability to maintain a pretty stable rewards rate, and good \u2013 stable pricing, but still growing faster.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then maybe if I could squeeze in one follow-up on credits. Mark, you highlighted second derivative improvement in card. It looks like most products in terms of year-over-year you're seeing better loss rates.","So I could just \u2013 I was just hoping you could maybe talk about what you're seeing from the customer base from a credit perspective. David, you alluded to this in your opening remarks. We've heard from a handful of companies, other consumer lenders that severity of loss is improving given that customers are in a little bit better shape. I was just wondering if you are seeing the same thing. And given the improvement that you're seeing, can you talk about what it means for your outlook for charge-offs, could we end up being on the low end of that 3% to 3.25%? Thanks.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","A lot in there, Ryan. I'll try to touch on all of it. I guess I would say, first and foremost, we continue to see quarter-over-quarter a \u2013 what I guess I would call a lessening of the slope of the normalization curve for three consecutive quarters now, in the card space, which feels very good.","This quarter about 50% of the reserve build was driven by the front book about 50% was driven by the back book. That's a lesser percentage off the back book, which I'd tell you, we, again, saw the pace of that normalization in the quarter continuing to mute.","Not ready to declare a seminal change at this point in time based upon one quarter's trajectory, but at the end of the day, clearly in the quarter we saw improvement in the consumer's ability to service their debt.","Overall macro, factors continue to feel good. Leverage is manageable on the part of the consumer. Unemployment's strong. You've got strong consumer confidence, so the environment feels pretty good, and we're very confident in that 3% to 3.25% range we put out there for charge offs on a full year basis.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. I had a follow-up question on credit. And I think Mark, the last call you alluded potential benefits you were seeing from tax cuts. I'm wondering if you still see signs of that, and if so, also whether you expect maybe you have a bigger impact towards the beginning of next year when refunds come in, as opposed to what comes through, just as a result of improved withholdings?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, so we did \u2013 Mark, you're right, we did see a coincident improvement in credit along with the \u2013 at the same when payroll processors changed their withholding levels.","Can't prove causality there, but there was clearly a coincident change. Since that point in time, though, we think that produced about $100 in the pocket of our average customer give or take. Since that point in time, though, we've seen gas prices creep back up that would theoretically have eaten into that, so it's a little unclear exactly what the net impact, the tax reform is at this point.","I'm clearly not a bad guy in and of itself in isolation. But it's a little unclear how much of a good guy it is. The overall improvement we're seeing, in terms of, again, that muting of the pace of growth in that normalization curve on the back book would lead me to conclude it's something more than a $100 in the pockets of every individual consumer that's driving that.","But I would say tax definitely belongs as one of the good guys on the list. In terms of what the refund scenario could look like at the beginning of next year, candidly, I don't think we spent a lot of time noodling over that one right now. But it's something good for us to think about as we move forward.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great, thanks. And just a question on the optics of delinquencies and charge-offs in the personal loan portfolio, as you actually potentially shrink that in the coming quarters, and obviously aren't adding as many receivables that are at the very early stage of their seasoning and don't have delinquencies, should we expect that to, kind of, tick up in the coming quarters?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Absolutely. You will see a denominator effect, Mark, as that (00:26:04), that lapping or the slowing of the growth. So I would expect charge-offs in that book to continue to rise from where they are right now.","You'll have seasoning of the vintages we have booked. You'll have the normalization that still continues that we just got done talking about in the card space, but clearly applies here as well.","You'll have the effect of slowing growth from the sub-segments we exited, that we talked about over the course of the last couple quarters. And then you'll have the incremental effect of the pull-back we're doing here. So, the ultimate dollars of losses we take won't be any higher. But because you won't be bringing on as many new accounts, the denominator effect will kick in, and you'll see the loss rate pick up.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great, thank you.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Just wanted to circle back on that issue of debt service. Mark, you just pointed out that there has been certainly some benefits to consumer tax reform and wage growth. But when we look at the aggregate data, we also see that leverage seems to be growing faster than disposable income.","So how do you think about that, particularly with respect to the fact that I think half your growth comes from your existing customer base. So presumably, you're contributing to that growth in leverage. Do you feel that there is an embedded credit risk there that's being fully acknowledged?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah. I think that right now as we look, Eric, we see the consumers' level of leverage, in our book, as measured by debt-to-income really coming back toward the levels it was at prior to the crisis, so let's call it normalization.","But the nature of that leverage has changed pretty dramatically. Prior to the crisis, the vast majority was variable rate in nature and was housed in an ARM. So, as rates were rising, that consumer had a real double whammy and came under a significant degree of stress.","Today, less than 10% of the consumer debt out there is variable rate. So you've got fixed rate and most of the growth that we have seen of recent years too has been really in fixed-rate product. It's been in Federal student loans, it's been in auto loan, it's been in personal loan. So, it feels like the levels of leverage are really returning to more normal levels, but that the composition of that leverage feels a little bit healthier than we saw before.","But clearly, that has been what's been driving the normalization that we've been experiencing along with all the other issuers in the back book. We're not seeing big movements in incidence rate. It's up a little, but we're not seeing big movements in incidence rates. It's really severities that are up. And that's just because when people go bad, they're carrying more debt, and the losses that all the lenders take are bigger.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. And if I can just follow-up one question on deposit pricing. I think you indicated 31 basis points in the quarter, which looks to be about what effective Fed funds rate moved in the quarter. So, I know you're well below the through-the-cycle average. But how do we think about the marginal cost of deposit pricing from here, and as it relates to your net interest margin?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, so the marginal beta was 10 basis points that we saw on the last Fed move. The cumulative beta thus far, since the rates have started rising, has been 46.","So continue to feel good about that. There has been a high degree of variability, in terms of \u2013 I think with the excess liquidity the Fed pumped into the system with their QE and the tapering hasn't gone on long enough now. You still have an excess of deposits kicking around in the system a little bit. And that's made the path of normalization of beta a little bit lumpier than it would have otherwise been because we've seen betas on some rate moves as high as 80. Again, the beta on the most recent move was 10 bps and cumulatively, we're sitting at a 46 since rates started to rise. So we feel really good about that, and we think a big chunk of that performance is tied to the fact that 60% of those depositors have got a relationship with us on the asset side of the balance sheet.","Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. Mark, we definitely see what you're pointing out, in terms of the trends on delinquencies and charge-offs starting to flatten out. And I think one of the other trends that's emerging is normal seasonality is re-emerging into the numbers. As this occurs, I'm curious, will we see the year-over-year provision expense start to converge back towards asset growth?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, it's probably a step further than I'm prepared to go at this point in time, would be the honest answer, Rick. Not ready to declare victory on that point yet. We've had a couple of quarters watching that normalization flatten. We've had a couple of quarters where normal seasonality seems to be occurring. So I agree with all your data points. Just not quite ready to make that call at this point in time. But we do feel very good and constructive about the credit environment. And we're hopeful that we actually do get comfortable making that call at some point here.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So perhaps asking the question in a slightly different way, unlikely at this point that the reserve rate will continue to rise in the way that it has over the last year, it started to flatten \u2013 it started to stabilize the last couple quarters?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah I would say that \u2013 we set the reserves on a quarterly basis, and we set them based on what we see emerge in the course of that quarter, in terms of 12-month-forward-looking losses.","So we're too early in the quarter this year for me to be able to sit back and prognosticate on exactly what that's going to look like. I would be so bold as to say we continue to see that flattening that we talked about earlier continue thus far in the quarter. So, that's obviously a positive indicator. But reserves will set once we have the benefit of a lot more information as the quarter moves on.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate that. Thanks, Mark.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli, with William Blair.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, and solid quarter. And you guys have been delivering solid numbers now for years. It's been somewhat hidden, as I think Rick was getting into the growth, the buildup in provisions. And it looks like credit losses are stabilizing.","And I know Mark, you're not ready to make that call on credit. But just as we look out, essentially, this company's had pre-tax income of $3.6 billion for five years in a row. And it looks like you're ready to accelerate, and you've reduced the share count dramatically.","So the combination of growing earnings and reducing share count, I guess, is what the market's looking for to improve your multiple. But as we look out over the next few years, David, what is the model for this company? Is it \u2013 loan growth and operating efficiency is great, but can it improve? How much should it improve? I think technology's allowing improvement. Do you expect loan growth 6% to 8%? Should pre-tax earnings grow at 10% over the medium to long-term? What is the business model for Discover? And what's going to drive that growth?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, I would say that we will continue to focus on trying to grow revenues faster than expenses. And for a number of years, we've been having very nice revenue growth. But normalization pushes back against the PBT growth. And yet, we're earning very high returns. So, a lot of the EPS growth has come from buybacks.","And if at some point, the normalization slows, that would be what should allow us to then start growing PBT again. But we're not providing guidance at this point. So, I don't want to get into specific targets. But I guess one thing I would say, is that our total asset base is much larger today than it was five years ago. And so essentially we've maintained a PBT while the ROA has gradually come down.","I think that's very healthy, because I think a few years ago we were probably overearning. We had, maybe an unsustainably high ROA, if you look at the long-term potential in a card business, and so I think we're now starting off with a more reasonable ROA, and if we can then, kind of, get to a point where we maintain that ROA, but continue to grow our loans, that then translates into PBT growth.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","And I guess that makes sense. Will you revisit? I mean, at one point you had given targets, and I think your last Investor Day and before that you had given longer term targets. Any thoughts of putting out longer term targets or raising your ROE target?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Bob, I would say on that front, that's something we evaluate every year and think about every year, but those are really meant to be through the cycle guides as opposed to annual guides. I'd just kind of \u2013 I'd echo David's comments that the EPS drivers really are going to be in this business, it's loan growth, it's NIM, it's expense management, it's capital management and it's underwriting credit card performance, right?","Those are going to be the key levers, and I appreciate in your question, given the way you asked it, because you're right, we focus on long-term value creation and those drivers that we control. And we're not \u2013 at Discover, we're really not going to get caught up in what folks are looking for this quarter or next quarter. We're going to run the compound shareholder value over the long haul.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And Bob, one thing that I would just add \u2013 we were just looking at some returns back from when we spun off, and our EPS over the year up until last year, was 18% compounded EPS growth.","But essentially, it all came the first four year \u2013 or there was a huge jump in the first couple of years. That's when we had a huge jump in PBT, but after the crisis, we had some big reserve releases which gradually diminished.","That turn gradually builds. And so it's \u2013 you almost have to look at it across the full cycle, it looks great, but you \u2013 depending on what part of the cycle is, it's lumpy. You get huge surges and then you, kind of, give back the ROA for a period of time. And so we feel really good that we've been able to maintain profitability even with a lot higher charge off rate, and much more normal charge off rate of about 3%, than when we were charging off at 2% and had reserve releases from a number of years ago.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark, I know you said you were comfortable with the expense guidance you've given, but looking back over the last few years, at least in two of the last three years, you had about 50% of the annual expenses spent in the first half of the year, and I know there were some unique things going on in some of those years, like with higher regulatory expenses or things tied to some other things. But just wondering if you expect the cadence of expenses this year to be a little bit more back-end weighted, given that you've already had like $1.9 billion in the first half of 2018?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, I would say the expense growth is really a function, Chris, of the business growth, right? So, we talked about it at the beginning of the year when we gave that annual guidance that we were going to be investing a chunk of the benefits of tax reform not only into advanced data and analytics capabilities, but also into some growth-related activities.","Those continue throughout the course of the year, and the pacing of those is not exactly linear, I would say, would be the right way to think about it. At the end of the day, we do believe we have the ability to drive the efficiency ratio lower over time.","We definitely had a lot more expense leverage in the model than you're seeing out of this, thus far this year, right? But as a kid who grew up on a farm, I'll use my farm analogy and that is you make hay while the sun shines. And we've got a great investment to invest for that growth. We've got a great opportunity to continue to enhance our digital and analytic capability.","And back to that thought about running the business for the long haul, this is the year we're choosing to make those investments. You saw 4% positive operating leverage out of us each of the last two years. This is a business model that naturally produces that positive operating leverage. It's just a choice we've made consciously to build for growth this year, to invest for the future this year.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then for my follow-up coming on a very different topic, so we recently got the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of American Express on anti-steering rules. Just wondering, not so much on the American Express side, but Visa and Mastercard had their settlements they made, I think in 2011 with the Department of Justice on some steering issues. But I'm not sure much has changed in the market since that time, I think, waiting for what the outcome of what the Amex litigation would be. Anyway, any changes you're expecting to make, now that we're through all this litigation? Or is it pretty much the same as it ever was, for issues around steering and your opportunities?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","For us, it maintains the status quo, and so I don't expect a business impact.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck, with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good evening.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Hey, Betsy.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, just a couple of questions. Mark, I think you mentioned earlier around promo balances, that you expected they were going to be falling throughout the year. I wasn't sure, as a percentage of total, I think that's what you meant. But maybe you could give us a little more color as to why you used the word rapidly, and just your outlook there?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, we invested pretty heavily as part of those growth expenses we talked about early in the year, Betsy. And part of that investment, in that case, went toward balance transfer activities.","Those mailings and those digital placements have not continued at anywhere near the same pace. Normally when you stop those mailings and digital placements, you start to see fall-off in the volume that's coming on from those offers sooner than we did this time.","So, we are now seeing the fall-off from those offers. We're clearly seeing the pieces of the puzzle align that's very comfortable that with a much lower level of balance transfer offering going forward than having changed the program a little bit as well, that that trajectory is going to continue and feel good that we will see 1% or more reduction over the course of the year in the level of promo balances in the portfolio today.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, okay. So it's around 1%, okay. And second question was just on transactors. And I know you're looking more for revolvers than transactors, but maybe you can help us understand how you're balancing between wanting to grow sales and having offers that do attract transactors with the balance growth that you're really looking for?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","I'd say, Betsy, our strategy has been very consistent, in that, we target people that are credit worthy, but at least have some propensity to maybe revolve at some point.","I think everyone knows that, if you think rewards pretty much offset interchange, if someone's a lifetime transactor, there is no revenue from that customer. And so we've continued to, therefore, focus on profitable resolvers. And some of our boost in transactor volume is more of a return to normal. Because there's fewer competitive offers that were pulling away some of the transactors from us a year ago and two years ago, particularly in some of the Sam's and Costco wars, and some of the people really targeting very high-end transactors. So to some degree, the grocery category also had an impact this quarter, because that seems to be more transacted. But generally, it's just bounced back to probably more normal levels, where loan and sales growth are about the same for us this quarter.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And do you feel like gas had a material impact, or even noticeable impact on the spend levels this quarter?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","It did. Our gas purchases are up 25% year-over-year. And that was a negative for several years, and it's flipped around to be a positive.","Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache, with Nomura Instinet.","William Carcache - Nomura Instinet","Thank you. Good evening. Mark, can you give us an update on what's happening specifically with negative credit migration in the portfolio? Just wondering whether along with the generally favorable credit trends that you've described, you're perhaps also seeing a notable lessening in the pace of customers that you've underwritten as prime credits, but are falling to sub-prime, and if so, why you think that is?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","We have seen in the most recent quarters a slowdown in the rate of a drop-off from the above 660, into the below 660 book. So yes, we have seen that. I really don't want to hazard a guess for you here on the call in terms of exactly what the moving parts and pieces of that are, other than to point back to what we've already talked about, and that being specifically the level of normalization, that curve is beginning to become muted.","I think the people who were overleveraged are, kind of, working their way through the system at this point in time a little bit. And at this point, looking at the roles in the buckets, looking at the current delinquency situation, credit is encouraging, right? That's not saying we expect credit to turn around and start having reserve releases, I don't want you to misunderstand. But clearly we see a very clear path where the health of the book is clearly still very good, and any signs of stress are moderating.","William Carcache - Nomura Instinet","Understood, thank you. If I may as a follow-up, what's the level of deposit beta where you think we'll no longer see NIM flow through benefit from additional rate hikes?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Considerably high right now. That 46 cumulative beta we're sitting at right now, is well below what our through the cycle expectations are, and the 10 basis point marginal beta on the most recent move is obviously \u2013 the 40 beta, rather, with the 10 basis point move is obviously well below. So, I would say we still have rate good guys from the positioning of the balance sheet and the deposit book.","William Carcache - Nomura Instinet","Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Buckingham.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Mark, sort of, circle back on the NIM for a second, you did a nice job of, sort of, walking through the quarterly progression. But can you maybe discuss the annual progression. Like I just noticed 22 basis points on the card yield year-over-year after 100 basis points plus of Fed moves.","I know there's lots of different factors that go into that, but you haven't really moved the sub-prime percentage that much. The one thing we can see hasn't moved that much. Obviously transactors have an effect, promotional balances, but 22 basis points seems real low, and is there a lag and maybe that can continue to catch up with some of the Fed moves?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So the book re-prices, if you think about it, on the next cycle date after a Fed move. So, there's not a particularly large lag on the revolving balances we have.","I think you rightly called out the moving parts and pieces. It's the level of promotional activity, which is coming in higher than we expected it to in the first half of the year, which has had a muting effect on that card yield number for sure. And the level of transactors we saw emerge in the book, obviously has a muting effect as well, because ultimately at the end of the day, that's a zero percent interest earning balance you're carrying.","So, our NIM guidance in terms of sticking to our full year thoughts obviously implies we expect to see improvement in the combination of those categories. So, I would expect you'd see more flow through to card yield as we look forward here.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then a quick follow-up on, maybe for David. Just an update on the checking accounts, the debit rewards products. It seems like a really exciting opportunity and was just hoping for additional update there in terms of traction and when are you going to go full scale and launch that product?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","Well, we're very pleased with the results in the first half of the year. We've had virtually no marketing, but with the redesign of the reward component early this year, we've seen a much higher per month take-up rate, doubled our new accounts per month.","We do expect to do some marketing in the second half of the year. We'll be introducing a new plastic design, and some additional feature functionality here shortly, but it will probably be next year before we're really ready to put more serious marketing heft behind it as we continue to get experience on the marketing and the fraud patterns and adding more feature functionality. We want to do this right. It'll be a gradual build. And over the very long term, we think it's very important, but we don't want to go too fast too early.","Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right, great. Looking forward to that, so. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to, kind of, just concur with your point on the mail volume in the personal loan business. Your mail volume, though, is probably \u2013 (00:50:22) probably 2.5 times your personal loan business, but you're still doing a couple of hundred million pieces a year. Could you talk a little bit about whether there's anything we should think about on your costs from reducing that, or are you going to be able to reallocate that to other activities?","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","I wouldn't \u2013 we're going to be pulling back, but I don't \u2013 I'm not sure what percentage it is, but don't think that that volume is going to go away for us. I mean we're keeping disciplined. We're mailing segments that work. Our cost per account actually has held up remarkably well considering the volumes.","In fact, one of the things that seems to be as a lot of that marketing that we're seeing out there, is not going to the same people that we're sending to. We're seeing people send many more pieces of mail than we think are good credit risks, and we see some people going maybe into sub-prime marketing, which obviously we're not in.","So I would think about maybe some expense pullback, but it's not going to be material to the company, and it doesn't get us out of the range that, Mark, kind of, reaffirmed that we expect for the year for the full company.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, I would say Moshe, most of it gets reallocated, right? To the extent there's pullback, we'll reallocate it because we continue to see great opportunities elsewhere to drive great risk-adjusted returns. So, this is not a reflection of some giant concern we have in our personal loan book. It's really more reflective of what we said earlier, there's times when in this business, you want to be on the accelerator, and there's times in this business where you want a slightly lighter foot. And so I think it's really more that and those expenses will get reallocated largely.","David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services","And essentially we'll continue to mark it down to the marginal return being strong, and there's still a lot of good personal loan business out there that has strong marginal returns as long as one keeps the pricing and credit discipline, which we're doing.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Well said.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Just as a follow-up, Mark, in the past you've talked about a lot of different factors, kind of, in addition to the underlying performance of your consumers, but macro factors, we talked a little bit about leverage. Other macro factors when you think about the level of the reserve, how are they performing? And how does that fit into your, kind of, reserve determination?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So the big macros they go into their reserve, Moshe, it would be, unemployment is a biggy. That one is obviously continuing to perform at a benign fashion as you think about the forward 12 months.","I think Moody's has been the outlier there in terms of forecasting, and they continue to kick the can down the road on when they see that tick up. I would say nonfarm payrolls would be a big input in terms of what we see, and that continues to go well.","Initial bankruptcy claims are a big one. We don't see a significant movement there at this point in time. Consumer confidence is a big input, that remains strong. It's deteriorated a little bit, but remains very strong. That's been just choppy with all of the geopolitical and political noise out there.","HPI continues to be a big input. That has continued to be strong across the spectrum, so that's why when we talk about a good environment, Moshe, in which to continue generating quality loans, the backdrop right now continues to feel very healthy on the part of the consumer. It doesn't mean you don't look for those pockets where, okay, there is signs of things getting a little long in the tooth emerging some of these segments in personal loans and the like, and you feather the accelerator there, and you reallocate toward areas where you see additional opportunities.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks so much.","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yep.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","Oh, hi, how are you?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Good, Brian, how are you?","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","My last question has six parts. First, just to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid, I mean, you went through each of the guidance lines individually, so if I'm looking at the fourth quarter presentation and the six line items you gave ranges on, you're basically saying you're still comfortable with each of those six ranges \u2013 loans, expenses, rewards, NIM, net charge offs, and tax rate. It's all still the same in your mind?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","Yeah, we didn't say anything about tax rate, but I'll go ahead and say, we're comfortable with the tax rate.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","And then just on the NIM trajectory, listening to you, it sounds like it would build through 3Q and then build again into 4Q if it's promos going down and Fed funds going up as two key drivers. Are you thinking like the exit run rate for NIM for the year is closer to 10.50? It seems optically like a big jump. I know you went through it one time. But is that like the implication? It's a 10.50 exit run rate for the year?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","I wouldn't validate the 10.50 number, but I would validate that it's definitely a big jump. There's no question. Through the first two quarters, we're sitting at a 10.22. That's not lost on us in any way, shape, means, or form.","And obviously we see a significant movement in the balance transfer and promo portion of the portfolio, as you might imagine, preparing for this call. And we spent a lot of time looking at that and making sure and pressure testing.","And we feel confident that we're going to see meaningful uptick in the NIM in the remainder of the year, and that for the full-year basis, that guidance still feels good.","The other thing I would say is, just to be clear, maybe give you a little bit of a peek under tent in this regard too, it was never our expectation that NIM was going to be flat, higher across the full course of the year anyway. We knew some of the growth investments we were making earlier in the year would have some muting effect there as well. Again, some of them just had more of a halo effect for longer than we thought they would.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","And then if I could sneak two small ones in, on just these dynamics you're talking about, on the balance transfers, is it just a dynamic around how many offers went out and what the take-up was?","Or has there been any change relative to what you thought on the maturing balance transfer sticking around at the standard rate? So any thoughts you can give on retention and balance transfers?","And then on the transactor and seasonality in two key point \u2013 and it's something you've brought up and CapOne brought up, and USB brought up \u2013 and it wasn't even on my radar screen, is it that transactors were higher than expected or is it just that the transactor drag, now that rates are higher, is a little bit more noticeable and we all, kind of, forgot about the seasonality when rates were at zero for so long. So, maybe if you could just remind us, is that transactor thing something that was unusual this year or something we should think about seasonally every year going forward?","R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services","So BT retention at the expiration of the BT continues to be economically positive, continues to perform well. That being said, in a rising rate environment, there's only so much of your balance sheet, you want to allocate to that BT environment. And again, kudos to our marketing team, they designed stuff that really worked and stuck around longer. It worked better than we expected it to.","So, we ended up with a little bit more of the balance sheet there. And again, that feathers off as we move forward throughout the remainder of the year pretty meaningfully. But I would say, BTs remain economic.","At this point in time, the retention is good there. And the NPV of those offers continue to be positive and good. In terms of the transactor side of the equation, I would say the answer to your question is it it's a both\/and. It is both transactors engaged at a higher level, higher degree of velocity. They were a greater portion of our spend increase to this quarter than they have been in a meaningful period of time.","And the cost of carrying that transactor float is obviously a little bit higher too, as rates have risen. So, our quarter-over-quarter comment really is reflective more of their percentage competition of the growth. But as time goes on, obviously the cost of that float goes up. And that will be a piece too.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. I think I got four in there. So I'll stop there.","Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services","You can call us back with the other two.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thanks, Craig.","Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services","Salacia, I think we're done. What do you think?","Operator","Yes, sir. I will now turn the floor back over to Craig Streem for any additional or closing remarks.","Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services","Sure. Thanks for your interest everyone. And of course, we are available for any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you, bye.","Operator","This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."]}}
