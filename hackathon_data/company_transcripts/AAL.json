Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Joining us on the call this morning is Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for a question-and-answer session are several of our senior executives, including Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Elise Eberwein: our EVP of People & Communications; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.","Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the third quarter and provide some additional information on guidance for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions, and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 that was also issued this morning.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call will be archived on the website as well, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","Thanks again for joining us. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Thanks everyone for joining us.","Today, we reported third quarter 2018 pre-tax profit of $688 million, excluding net special items. Those results include our highest ever revenue performance, thanks to our 130,000 hard-working team members. But unfortunately, a rising fuel prices outpaced that increase in revenues. Higher jet fuel prices alone increased our quarterly expenses by over $750 million versus the same quarter last year. And therefore, our pre-tax earnings, excluding specials for the quarter, were $485 million lower than the third quarter 2017.","The declining earnings has been met with a declining stock price, which neither we nor our investors are happy about. The good news is, we're extremely bullish on the future of American and for good reason. This disconnect between the stock price and our view of the future seems to us like a buying opportunity, and we're happy to be here to talk to you all about it.","So, look, there are five reasons that we're so bullish. First, we have extensive revenue initiatives underway that are expected to bring more than $1 billion in revenue improvements to American in 2019 versus 2018. Importantly, the drivers of this value are not share shift because of a better product like new airplanes or industry-leading Wi-Fi or world-class clubs and lounges, though we certainly believe some upside exist in that regard. This is a value that'll happen as we simply execute against known projects such as project segmentation, fleet reconfiguration and international network restructuring.","Second, and we also expect about $300 million in cost improvements in 2019 versus this year. That's the result of our One Airline project, which has been expanded and accelerated in light of higher fuel costs and Derek will discuss that further.","Third, we have the opportunity to grow where we have a real competitive advantage. We have, what we believe, will be the lowest growth plans in the industry for 2019, but we also have what we believe are the best growth prospects. We have 15 gates opening at our largest and most profitable hub in Dallas\/Fort Worth in early 2019. We have routes in and out of Dallas\/Fort Worth that will immediately generate higher than average profitability versus the marginal profitability that airline growth usually generates.","Fourth, we're dedicated to improving our operating reliability. And we've been steadily improving the operating reliability of American according to plan in each year since our merger in late 2013. But that trend changed in the summer of 2018, and we backed (00:05:04) a little bit. As Robert will discuss, we've rededicated ourselves to producing the best operational reliability since our merger in 2019 and that's our top corporate priority. The work has already begun showing some great results, so this is an even more upside for 2019.","And then fifth, we are nearing the end of our major post-merger capital expenditure requirement. Our capital expenditures in American have averaged $5.3 billion per year in the five years since the merger. That over $25 billion is by far the most any carrier has invested in its fleet, product and team in the history of commercial aviation. And the result is a valuable set of assets that'll serve our shareholders well for decades to come.","And we're going to spend a little under $5 billion in 2019 as we have one more aircraft order to fund. But after that, we're largely done with the backlog. And our CapEx drops precipitously to approximately $3 billion in 2020, $2 billion in 2021 and we expect it will remain in the $2 billion to $3 billion range thereafter.","So, because of all of those items, we're excited about our near and long-term future. We're confident that American will return to revenue outperformance and earnings growth in 2019 and beyond. Now, it sounds like we're extremely optimistic because we are, but please don't mistake confidence for indifference. We're extremely focused on results and execution and completing the hard work necessary to deliver this value. We've just happen to be confident it will happen because we know we have the right plan in place and the right people to deliver it. We look forward to proving that over time.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek and Robert.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone.","Before I begin, I'd like to recognize and thank our team who have had to contend with some very challenging weather conditions during the quarter. Their hard work and willingness to go above and beyond on behalf of our passengers in some very difficult circumstances is appreciated by us all.","We filed our third quarter earnings press release and 10-Q this morning. While this was another profitable quarter for American Airlines, earnings were lower due primarily to a 38% increase in average fuel cost per gallon. Excluding net special items, we reported a net profit of $523 million in 2018 versus our 2017 net profit of $729 million, which included a negative impact to pre-tax earnings from Hurricane Florence for approximately $50 million.","Our diluted earnings per share, excluding net special items in the third quarter of 2018, was $1.13 per share, and excluding net special items our third quarter pre-tax profit was $688 million with a pre-tax margin of 6%. Our total operating revenues were 5.4% to $11.6 billion, the highest third quarter revenue in American Airlines' history. On a unit revenue basis, total revenue per ASM was up 2.6% and this was the eighth consecutive quarter in which we achieved positive unit revenue growth. Passenger revenues were $10.6 billion, a 4.6% improvement driven in part by a 2.2% improvement in yields.","The third quarter saw another excellent performance by our cargo organization. For the third quarter, cargo revenue was $260 million, a 16.4% improvement year-over-year driven primarily by a 12.1% improvement in yields. Other revenues were up 14.5% driven primarily by continued strength in our loyalty program.","Total operating expenses were $10.9 billion, up 12.4%. The primary driver of this increase was the higher fuel price, I mentioned earlier, which drove approximately $750 million of year-over-year incremental expense. As a result, consolidated cost per ASM was up 9.4% year-over-year.","In this increasing fuel cost environment, we continue to make the reduction of non-fuel cost a priority. When we initially provided guidance on our third quarter of 2018 back in January, we projected that fuel would be at approximately $2.10 a gallon and at CASM excluding fuel and special items would increase by approximately 1.5% on ASM growth of close to 4%.","As fuel cost increased throughout the year, we worked to eliminate non-essential costs from the organization while at the same time optimizing our network and focusing on reducing unprofitable capacity. As a result of these efforts, our third quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items was up only 0.8% year-over-year on an over 100-basis-point reduction in system capacity growth to 2.7%.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $7.4 billion in total available liquidity. During the quarter, our treasury team completed several transactions including a $500 million upsize of our London Heathrow term loan as well as securing financing for certain 2019 aircraft deliveries. We now have financing for all mainline aircraft deliveries through June of 2019.","In addition, the company made $156 million contribution to its defined benefit plans. For the year, we have made $467 million in pension contributions. One benefit of the rising interest rate environment is that it reduces our pension liability, which all else being equal, will lower future pension funding obligations and improve our free cash position in the medium to long-term.","As of today, we estimate our GAAP liability has reduced by $2 billion from the start of the year and our 2019 cash contribution has reduced by about $110 million to $780 million based on year-to-date asset performance.","We have lowered our adjusted debt including pensions by $743 million since the beginning of the year. Now that our fleet renewal program is winding down, we continue to believe that our 2018 year-end adjusted debt will be lower than at the end of the third quarter and we expect that over the next few years this trend will continue as we naturally de-lever the company.","We did not repurchase any stock during the third quarter, leaving our available authorization for stock buybacks unchanged at $1.65 billion. The fact that we did not repurchase any stock is not due to a change in our belief that the stock is undervalued.","As we have consistently said, our priorities for our use of cash are: number one, to meet our outstanding obligations when due; two, to make appropriate investments in the business; and finally, to opportunistically return any excess liquidity to shareholders.","We define excess liquidity as anything above the very high level of $7 billion. As fuel prices rose earlier this year, we began to forecast the year-end cash balance near that $7 billion target level so we stopped repurchasing our shares. We're extremely bullish on AAL and would be aggressive buyers at these levels, but maintaining $7 billion of target liquidity is a key component of our capital allocation strategy and we won't violate it to repurchase shares irrespective of our bullishness.","We filed our investor update this morning, which includes our guidance for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our previous guidance given on the last earnings call, we continue to expect our full-year system capacity growth will be just over 2%, down significantly from our expectations of approximately 3% at the beginning of 2018.","Despite this reduction, we continue to believe that our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM ex-fuel and special items will be flat, and our full-year 2018 CASM will be up approximately 1.5%, down 50 basis points from our expectations in January of 2018.","Given the run-up of fuel over the past few months, we continue to expect higher fuel expense in the fourth quarter of 2018. Based on the fuel forward curve as of October 24, we are forecasting an increase in consolidated fuel expense of 33% or $2.5 billion for the full-year 2018. For the full year, we now anticipate our fuel price to be between $2.22 to $2.27 per gallon.","We also guided to a fourth quarter 2018 TRASM increase of 1.5% to 3.5% to which Robert will provide more details on in his remarks. With our combined revenue and cost guidance, we expect our fourth quarter of 2018 pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, to be between 4.5% and 6.5% and our full-year 2018 earnings per share, excluding net special items, guidance to be between 4.5% and 5%.","We are still in the process of developing our plan for 2019. With fuel prices remaining high, we are once again revealing our capacity plans as we're in the middle of our budgeting process. We continue to expect our ASM growth in 2019 to be in line with or below estimated GDP growth and amongst the lowest of the industry. Our capacity growth in 2019 will come primarily from our unique opportunity to add incremental flying to Dallas\/Fort Worth, our most profitable hub, as well as our fleet modernization project to add existing seats to our narrowbody aircraft, which allows us to grow capacity in extremely efficient way.","In addition to this margin-accretive growth, we are confident of successful execution on our business plan, which we continue to believe will include an incremental $1.3 billion in revenue and cost opportunities for 2019. Given this level of capacity and the incremental cost opportunities, we continue to expect that our CASM growth in 2019 will be in the 1% to 2% range that we previously guided, and we'll have a better read once we finish our 2019 planning process by year end.","In terms of capital expenditures for 2019, we continue to expect that we will spend $2.9 billion on aircraft CapEx, as we take delivery of new large RJs that replace 50 seaters along with narrow-body aircraft to replace our MD-80 fleet that we'll retire after next summer. We now believe our non-aircraft CapEx will be $1.7 billion in 2019, $100 million lower than previous guidance.","After 2019, most of our integration projects will be complete. At that time, our obligations reduce considerably. And we estimate that total CapEx will be $2.9 billion in 2020 and $2.2 billion in 2021, thus allowing us to generate significant free cash flow.","During 2018, we have adjusted to higher costs by reducing capacity growth, slowing non-fuel CASM growth by pulling forward some of our One Airline cost initiatives, and lowering our capital expenditures by deferring aircraft. Going forward, we will continue to focus on growing network profitability, executing on our revenue opportunities, and further lowering costs throughout the airline.","We have an exciting long-term vision for American Airlines, and we're pleased with the success of our efforts in 2018. We will continue on this path, as strengthening our business in the short term will allow us to take full advantage of the opportunities available to us in the medium and long term.","In conclusion, I would like to once again thank our entire team for their hard work, a challenging quarter.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Derek, and good morning, everybody.","In October, we successfully completed our largest integration project to date, moving all 27,000 American flight attendants into one scheduling system. The benefits and efficiencies we'll gain are wide-reaching. Our flight attendants are no longer limited to flying on their legacy carrier's aircraft, and will have the flexibility to move to different bases.","For our customers, we'll be able to recover more quickly following irregular operations. And it removes the friction point from how we schedule our aircraft and crews, giving us more operational flexibility and the ability to optimize our network and drive efficiencies. This was a massive four-year effort by our team, who invested more than 6.2 million hours to ensure our success. I want to thank all of our team members who worked behind the scenes to prepare us and on the front-line, who have seen an enormous amount of change.","Progress on integration is one reason our operation is set to improve. Since the merger and up through this past winter, American had been making steady progress in improving core operating reliability while also achieving important merger milestones. However, this past summer we fell short of our targets that we had set for ourselves. While there are factors like inclement weather and unexpected increases in workload associated with some aircraft types that contributed to our underperformance, we know that we must do better, and we will.","To that end, our immediate focus is on making sure that our fleet is ready to go each morning and that we resource our team to turn aircraft on time throughout the day. We have taken immediate short-term actions and launched a comprehensive review of our planning processes to ensure that we are ready to deliver better service during peak schedule periods, like the summer and year-end holidays.","Our efforts are already paying dividends, as evidenced by two successive zero cancellation mainline operations this past week. And we're also operating at greater than 99% mainline completion factor so far in October, despite difficult operating conditions at DFW and also dealing with Hurricane Michael.","On that note, I have to point out what an incredible job our teams across the system did to recover from both Michael and Hurricane Florence in September. In both instances, our teams were well prepared, and the greatest testament to that is how quickly we got the operation back up and running, especially out on the East Coast.","On the product side, we've talked a lot about the $25 billion we have invested since our merger in people, facilities, and product, laying the foundation for a more efficient and reliable airline, and we're not done yet. We continue to make significant investments in our product, and we'll continue to grow our Flagship First Dining, our Flagship First Lounges with DFW opening in the first quarter of 2019. We're also investing more in our Admirals Club network with refresh projects in Boston, Charlotte B, and also in Pittsburgh in the first half of 2019.","We have significantly enhanced connectivity on board by adding high-speed Wi-Fi and in-seat power. Half of our long-term domestic mainline fleet now has high-speed Wi-Fi, and installations will be complete by next summer. We are adding live TV to our domestic mainline fleet, a product our international customers have been enjoying since 2016. These transformational investments in our product, which touch every point of the customer's journey, will drive higher revenues and improve customer perception.","We continue to play to our strengths when it comes to our network, adding high-quality, high-margin growth and redeployment opportunities at our most profitable hubs. Our 2018 domestic network additions to Dallas\/Fort Worth and Charlotte produced margins far above our system average. And in 2019, we'll continue to capitalize on that strength by adding 15 gates and 100 departures per day at DFW. In 2020, we will add seven new gates at Charlotte, enabling another 75 daily departures. In 2021, the new regional terminal will open at Reagan National, allowing us to up-gauge to 76-seat regional jets at 14 gates, which today as a practical matter are limited to 50-seat regional jets.","Our sales team has been executing well on its strategies. In the third quarter, we saw corporate revenue growth outpacing top line revenue on improved average ticket values. We have a healthy pipeline of new corporate accounts and made a number of advancements for customers, including our integration with SAP Concur TripLink so that our corporate customers can now book travel through aa.com while still receiving their company's negotiated rates. We also launched a partnership with Alibaba to accept Alipay on aa.com in China. Alipay is China's most popular form of payment.","American is uniquely positioned with the largest airline loyalty program in the world. AAdvantage is a key asset for us and our customers, adding $4.2 billion in revenue for the first nine months of 2018. We have a valuable co-brand model with great partners in Citi, Barclays, and MasterCard. In the third quarter, we saw strong year-over-year acquisition growth with lower than expected attrition and continued growth in card spend.","We are excited about the enhanced benefits we announced to our Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select card in May and the introduction of a no fee co-brand card in July, the AAdvantage MileUp card. These recent additions to our portfolio build on our already strong value proposition to customers, helping to ensure that an AAdvantage co-brand card is the primary card for even more travelers. Looking to 2019, we'll continue to find new ways to provide choice and value to our customers in our loyalty and co-brand programs.","Our segmentation strategy is performing well. Premium Economy is now installed on 92 aircraft, and the customer adoption of this highly differentiated product has been strong. We also continue to be encouraged with the average fare differential, which is double the coach fare, as customers continue to buy up from main cabin. Installations remain on track and will be complete by next summer. As we look into 2019, we will further monetize this product with new revenue management and merchandising capabilities.","In September, we made Basic Economy more competitive by removing the carry-on bag restriction, allowing us to offer Basic Economy to more markets more often. The early results are very positive and have exceeded our initial expectations, with approximately three times more customers now buying up to a higher fare for our main cabin product. Basic Economy is offered across the entire domestic network as well as most of the Atlantic, Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America.","Our third quarter revenue was up 5.4% year over year to $11.6 billion, setting a record for any third quarter. As Derek mentioned, we saw double-digit growth in our cargo and other revenues, driven in part by continued strength in co-brand credit card acquisitions and cardholder spend.","TRASM improved 2.6% year over year, above the midpoint of our initial guidance and marks the eighth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. We saw sequential improvements during the quarter in domestic yield and that momentum has continued into the fourth quarter.","We also realized strong performance in our international business, particularly across the Atlantic. There, we saw double-digit growth in passenger revenue and a 7.7% year-over-year increase in unit revenue. The solid improvement was driven by strong yield performance in our premium cabin and the continued benefits of our segmentation strategy, led by the Premium Economy and Basic Economy products.","As we had anticipated, our Latin America performance was a little challenging during the quarter due to macro concerns in Argentina, political uncertainty in Brazil and a soft pricing environment in Mexico. The remainder of our Latin America network is performing well with notable strength in the Caribbean and Central America. Overall, revenue for the region still grew by 2.3%, albeit on 4% higher capacity, 2.6-percentage-point lower loads and an encouraging 1.5% higher yield.","Unit revenue grew in the Pacific for the fourth consecutive quarter with PRASM up 2.4% year-over-year. Premium cabin performance remained strong, with Japanese and Korean markets showing the best performance year-over-year.","Looking forward, we see continued strength in bookings as the demand for our product remains strong. Despite a very tough fourth quarter comparison, we expect our year-over-year system TRASM to be up 1.5% to 3.5% in the December ending quarter. This will be our ninth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth.","As we approach the end of our integration, we have the opportunity to pursue a number of initiatives that in many cases have already been implemented by our competitors and have been in our plan for a long time. In 2019, we'll increase revenues by $1 billion thanks to optimizing our Basic Economy product, expanding the use of Premium Economy seats, further refining our suite of revenue management tools, continuing our fleet harmonization project and many more items.","We also expect to become more efficient with more than $300 million of cost initiatives in line of sight and the hub optimization at DFW I mentioned. That will be beneficial to margins and probability relative to the competition. We're very excited about the future.","And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and begin our Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning everybody. Doug, in a presentation you did last fall, I guess, it was this fall, I think it was (00:27:21) event, you cited that your aggregate margin performance in, I think it was Charlotte, Dallas, and Washington, and what that implied for your other hubs was comparatively poor round numbers, and implied that Chicago, Phoenix, and Miami were a little bit less than half as profitable as the best hubs.","I certainly have my views as to what the drivers are for that potential disparity, again, this is all back of the envelope, but I am curious to hear what you think the drivers might be and whether there are any solutions for those weaker hubs?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie. First, let me clarify because also on those numbers we include LAX and New York, right. So you shouldn't assume that that's Miami, Chicago and Phoenix.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair. That's fair.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","So, but nonetheless fair point. I think as you look at \u2013 anyway, what I'd tell you is, again, every airline I've been at it's often the case. You have some parts of the system that do better than others, but they all contribute to the system. And indeed that's certainly the case with operations like JFK, like our LA and New York operation, and indeed our Miami operation right now, certainly is underperforming on a financial basis given the economics of the region.","So, but Chicago, Phoenix were solid. And does others will be solid over time, or they contribute to the rest of the system because of what they provide us and our ability to serve the corporate travel. So, it won't be same. We're really happy with the route network as it exists today. Expect no changes and particularly happy with the fact that we have the ability now to grow in those that are the most important \u2013 well, not most important, I shouldn't say, but those that have the highest profit generation capabilities DFW, Charlotte and DCA. And we've done a nice job, I think, of filling out all the rest of the others to a critical mass. Do you want to add anything to that?","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Jamie. I just wanted to add though, in terms of the kind of adjustments we're making, we do think that in all of our hubs whether it's growing or redeploying assets to Charlotte, DFW and DCA that that will make those even stronger. But some of the actions that we've recently taken are specifically designed to ensure that places like Chicago and Miami perform better as well. And so, we know that the reductions in the Chicago up to Asia flying is definitely going to help there. You know about the gate initiatives that we've made, which further strengthen the connectivity capabilities of Chicago as a domestic connecting hub for us.","And then in terms of Miami as well, we have some underperformers, S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte that we've made adjustments to and we're keeping an eye on all of South America to make sure that we're strong as possible.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Appreciate. I'm sorry. Something else?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No. I said thanks to Robert. Go ahead.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And thank you, Robert, as well. And a follow-up for you, Robert. You talked enthusiastically quite a bit about the operations. When it comes to fuel, it's a fairly simple analysis to calculate how much time is required by the airline or the industry to recoup higher prices. What I'm not able to figure out is, when operations improve, how long does it take to win back some of the corporate share that you might have shared it in recent years? So first, do you have an opinion on that lag; and second, what level of corporate share recapture, if any, does your internal 2019 forecast assume?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, first off, Jamie, let me tell you, there hasn't been any loss in corporate share at American. We've had a really solid quarter in corporate revenue, as I mentioned, growing faster than top line revenue growth. And as we take a look, it's broad strength across the corporates led by professional services. We've got a healthy pipeline of new accounts. 450 new managed corporate accounts signed just this past quarter and a lot of enhancements coming. We haven't seen any weakness or fall off. And as a matter of fact, we're really pleased with what we've seen and improving operation is only going to drive more benefit.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And the 2019 numbers don't assume any sort of increase. So, I think, if there's and that will be upside, Jamie.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Sure. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks. Appreciate the question. So, you've been pretty conservative and pretty subdued with your domestic capacity growth. And I wonder if you could just expand a little bit on kind of the 3Q performance, because 1% domestic RASM relative to peers relative to what frankly the economy did, what happened there? How do you see that going forward? And how did you post 2%, 3% domestic revenue in the third quarter?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay, this is Don. I'll take this one. Again, if you go look at our domestic performance, what we see is improving trends. If you look at our third quarter performance, our unit revenue performance in domestic was better than our second quarter unit revenue performance, which was also positive. We're seeing improved yields in the domestic business not only in the third quarter, but in particular as we look forward into the fourth quarter. Lot of this is driven by changes in the pricing environments, particularly, in ULCC markets.","Business demand remains pretty robust. We're seeing improvement in close in yields. Strong corporate demand, Robert mentioned that. Our domestic corporate revenue grew at 10% in the quarter and that remains continues to be positive as we look forward. So, as we look at our domestic performance, we, again, saw improvement as we went from Q2 to Q3, and we expect as we're looking into the Q4 outlook that domestic will improve again.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks, and then just a quick follow-up for Derek. Can you speak to the pension gains that were in non-op in 2018? And how you see those trending into 2019? Thanks for taking the questions.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","The pension gains will they stay for another three years I think, and then run-off, but they year-over-year will be the same as in your 2019 model of the pension gains.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Duane.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Doug and Derek, you talked about the CapEx profile coming down in 2021. Just want to be crystal clear that those numbers have moved around a little bit it feels like the past couple years or so. Are you guys both committing to no more than $3 billion CapEx in 2020 and no more than $2 billion in 2021?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","It's an estimate. Go ahead, Derek.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, I wouldn't say we'll commit to anything, but I think, I mean they've moved and they've been pushed out and it's really driven by the deliveries. So, yes, we're set with the deliveries in 2019, 2020, 2021. And the aircraft deliveries, from an aircraft CapEx, 2020 is about $1.2 billion and 2021 is $1 billion and 2022 is $1.3 billion. And we have no reason to change that.","So, I would say, yes that is where we're going to be from a total CapEx perspective. And the run rate, as we go forward, should be in that 2.5% range steady state even going forward from there, because we don't have any plans for any new aircraft at this point in time going forward since we've already really gotten through the fleet replacement program and taken on over 600 new aircraft now since the merger.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Joe, anyways, what we believe and I think it's a belief that make sense, let just share the assumption behind it, which is what Derek has said, which is, we don't have any need at this point for additional aircraft to replace older aircraft, which we did have over time and that's what the current plan calls for. I guess, the only way it would go up from that is for some reason, we decide we want to grow like in excess of what we currently believe then we go decide, we need to go find other aircraft. But anyway, that's...","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. And Joe, there is only one \u2013 I mean, from a fleet perspective, we still have some 50-seat aircraft that we'd like to replace with larger gauge aircraft, two-class aircraft. And we haven't committed that yet and looked at that. So, we have an opportunity in the regional space, and that's really the only place. From a mainline and widebody aircraft, everything is really in place for the next four, five years.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, Robert, you mentioned something in your prepared remarks about a credit card you guys have with Citi and Barclays; that sounds pretty exciting.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","It is.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Robert, in respect for my colleagues, can you spend 90 seconds talking about that? Assume I know nothing about the partnership, how do you guys get value? How does the business work? Would love to hear more. Thank you.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","All right. Well, first off, we have to start with the AAdvantage program. So, our loyalty program, which is the largest program and we believe the best out there in the business. As a benefit, there is the opportunity to align with partners. And in this case, we're aligning with Citi and Barclays. So, they can brand their credit card and offer benefits to their customers when they acquire credit cards and then also spend on those credit cards by earning miles that are redeemable ultimately in our program.","American is obviously paid for those miles. Those miles are a nice business for us and something that we are able to offer customers value for that keep people really interested. At the end of the day, the value is in the American brand, the value is in \u2013 the service that American offers find people to the places that they want to go and that is something that a lot of different partners want to be part of, and in this case, Citi and Barclays.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'll take it. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. I just had a question on the cadence and the timing of when the new gates are going to open up and how impactful the redeployment of some of the capacity into those better margin hubs is going to be, like how should that affect the trajectory of earnings as you move through 2019?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Derek, can help me out a little with this, but the gates are going to start layering on in May and we'll fill them up over time as the summer progresses. And in terms of benefits in either growth or redeployment opportunities that will layer in. And we haven't yet given any estimates on how much that will improve, but we do know that it is going to be profitable for us.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, I agree. And David that's not included in the $1 billion revenue synergies or revenue opportunities that we talked about. We're working to get those gates open as soon as we can, and we'll layer that in as we move forward from a revenue perspective into the 2019 forecast.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning. Hey, Doug. So, you guys talked about corporate revs being strong, you're not the only one, but you're also paying for that again with these TMC commissions, they're up hugely across the industry, but I know there's been a little bit of an effort in the industry early this year to sort of get back some of the front-end commissions you're paying to the TMCs. I'm wondering, A, how that's going? How we should think about the trajectory of these TMC or these agency commissions going forward? And if you want to include how NDC ramping may help to offset some of these agency commission expense that'd be great. Thank you.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay, Hunter. This is Don. In terms of commission expenses, this is really competitive marketplace, right. So, we really focus on competitiveness and that's really the focus, right. So, in terms of trajectory and TMC or any kind of commission costs, we've been actually relatively flat. And where going forward is really to stay competitive with our big competitors on a network basis.","As for NDC, our focus on NDC is to improve the products, right, that we offer to our customers particularly our corporate customers. And it is less of a cost initiative for us than it is an ability to be able to put more products and particularly bundled products in front of our corporate customers.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thanks, Don. And then, Steve Johnson, one question for you. Can you talk \u2013 the UK is announcing that it's going to review the existing ATI you have with BA. I was surprised by this. A lot of people that know things were surprised by this, no one better than I do on this topic were surprised by it. Can you tell us what they are going to be examining? And if you want to fold that into a broader conversation about how regulators are viewing ATI and JVs in general these days that'd be great. Thank you.","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure, Hunter. Thanks. It's really good question. And, first, I suppose if you were surprised shame on us a little bit. The arrangement with the Atlantic joint business has always been that it would be reviewed by the European regulators in advance of its 10th anniversary, which is in 2020. As Brexit is unfolded, that responsibility moved from the EU to the UK, and they for reasons I think are they just had the resources available to start doing the review now. We are very optimistic about how the review is going to come out.","These joint businesses really provide fabulous consumer benefits, and all of the studies that we've done of the Atlantic joint business, in particular in JVs in general, have demonstrated that. And there certainly is no joint business that has come close to what we've been able to produce for consumers than our Atlantic joint business.","I suspect the review will take a few months. There will be, I'm sure, a report written at some point in time, but our expectation is that they are going to firmly endorse the Atlantic joint business and reach conclusions like the ones that I just described.","I maybe can just take a minute to go on. This work that we've done to review joint businesses, there have now been 17 or 18 years of robust data from joint businesses. And we've assembled it and put it into our advocacy around our Qantas joint business application and our two applications that are forthcoming. It's really very compelling. And we expect both the UK and the United States DOT to recognize that and firmly endorse the joint business concept going forward.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you, Steve.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Robert, you mentioned that with the change in your carry-on bag policy that you're seeing three times the number of passengers now buying up, and I guess presumably that's just because you're able to offer the Basic Economy in a lot more markets. As I recall though, I think that you weren't initially pleased about the percentage about the buy-up, maybe it was under 50%. Can you give us a sense of maybe how that percentage is trending with the recent change in policy?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Mike, it's Don.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Don.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","We're actually ahead of what our expectations are for this launch. So when we launched it, the change in the carry-on bag restriction, we knew that that would allow us to have the product in more markets more often. And we expected as part of that that we would see the sell-up rate go down, but the number of customers selling up go up, and that rate is going to be positive for us.","What we observed is that the percentage of customers buying up hasn't materially changed. So we expect to see that drop from the low 60s down to about 50%, but it's still sitting around 60%. So that's actually much better than we expected.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, very good. And then my second question, and I'm not even sure who can answer this, as it relates to Venezuela. I saw the news out that I guess airlines doing business in that country will have to transact in their cryptocurrency, the petro. Just curious about whether or not that actually is going to impact you and whether or not that's legit or not, any color on that.","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","There shouldn't be. We sell only in dollars. And those markets, although we've reduced our capacity pretty significantly in Venezuela, continue to be really very profitable for us.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And I'll just add. Venezuela, just to give you an idea, it's 0.2%of our system revenues, so we don't have a lot of exposure there anyway.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, very good. Okay, thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question is from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Savi.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","One quick follow-up before my question. On the regional trend, is it fair to assume domestic is going to continue to sequentially improve, which it just sounds like from your comments? But what about the other regions from a sequential standpoint should we expect?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay, this is Don. So domestic, we're seeing some improvements, and I'll just add that if you go look at our performance last year in the fourth quarter domestically, we were many, many points higher than everybody else in the fourth quarter. So to get some sequential improvement there, I think, is quite positive. We're expecting Atlantic and Pacific actually to perform in line with what we had in the third quarter, and we're seeing continued softness in Latin America.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And just if I might ask on the operating reliability again, Rob, I appreciate the color that you provided there on trying to fix it. The near-term improvement is encouraging, but it is off-season. So what gives you confidence as it's going to head into next summer that this continues? And are there some network changes that need to be made to address some of the issues?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","The confidence stems from a lot of work that's been done over the years is coming to fruition. So getting FAI, our Flight Attendant Integration, behind us I think is a big step. As we take a look at aircraft reliability as well, I do think that there are some things that we can do and are doing to make sure that we start the day off right, and that's really encouraging.","And then as we take a look at network and schedule, there are always opportunities to rationalize fleets, to make routings more efficient, to make better use of reserves and spares. And so all that's under consideration. But when I take a look back over the course of the year, and yes, we're dealing with more of a shoulder season right now, but I do take a look at what we've done in really difficult operating conditions such as hurricanes and some really inclement weather here in DFW. I am impressed by the recovery that we've made and our ability to actually perform well in those conditions.","So I'm encouraged. I see the results. As I take a look at the steady progression we made from 2014 to all the way through 2017 and then through the first quarter or so of 2018, I see us back on that kind of trend line that will show improvement going forward.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And I'm guessing that should drive some cost improvement. Is that reflected in that 1% to 2% guide then?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","It should drive cost improvement. It is within that guide of whether we do that, but we still haven't gone through the planning process. And as we go through the planning process, we'll see the adjustments that Robert's talking, whether it's from a schedule perspective or an operations perspective and build that into the 2019 budget.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Savi.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you very much for taking the time, just one question here. What do you estimate your fuel recapture has been maybe year to date?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I don't know if we've got that number, Derek? Let me just go ahead and then we'll \u2013 anyway, this is not a number that we actually calculate. But I can tell you having looked at I think what others do is, just how much have your earnings changed versus how much your fuel price has changed, which any of us can calculate.","What you'll see is it's going to be a lower number than our two largest competitors, which is another way of saying how come your earnings have fallen more. Our fuel prices have gone up about the same amount as a percentage of expense. So the question if you're asking us why have your earnings fallen more, I'm just trying to get to the core cause. It's because our revenues haven't gone up as much. Our revenues are up, but not as up as much as those two airlines.","A trend that we've been narrowing over time, as we talked on last quarter's call, we started to see that widen in 2018, a trend we don't like, a trend that we expect is going to reverse itself back in 2019. But anyway, there are separate stories for separate airlines. One of our large competitors had not their best year last year, so they're comparing to that, of course. When you look at us versus that airline on a two-year basis, we're still up on unit revenues versus that carrier. But anyway, so that's just a year-over-year comp issue.","And then, but versus Delta, that's one that we've been narrowing nicely about for a couple of years in a row, has started to widen. But as we look at that, I think it's much what they are doing a better job than we can today of making sure this sell-up activity is available to the customers. They have products that are there where people buy, and they're available in channels that we don't have it available in yet. So we view that as upside. It's a big piece of our $1 billion of revenue initiatives is getting to the point where others have gotten and we just hadn't yet but will in 2019 in having those products available in more channels and easier to purchase. So we view that as upside.","But anyway, Helane, when you look at it, getting as whatever the number is, you'll see its lower. However you calculate it, ours is going to be lower than those. And the reason is driven by our revenues not increasing at the same \u2013 our unit cost ex-fuel you saw was like less than 1% on some pretty small growth. So that's not the issue. It's just the relative revenue performance and the relative revenue performance as I described.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right, got you. And then just to follow-up on that. As you guys, I think, Derek, you said, and I know it's in the annual report. You talked about the large number of regional jets that are coming in next year. So, as we think about your gauge for next year, how should we think about that relative to, I guess, revenue because gauge comes down next year or goes up?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Part of what's going on next year is our reconfiguration project. So, the gauge should actually go up next year a little bit as we bring on the aircraft, as we modify the 321s and the 73s. And from a regional perspective, the gauge should go up also. So, in both cases, I would expect gauge to be a positive next year, which as you know is positive growth for us. I think it could be around 1% of gauge as we take the mainline and regional combined next year.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great, thanks very much, guys.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Crissey from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Kevin Crissey - Citi","Hey, thanks for the time.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure.","Kevin Crissey - Citi","I'm not sure who is best positioned to answer this, but when you benchmark American's cost structure and efficiency metrics against your peers, what areas present the biggest opportunities aside from maybe the Dallas\/Fort Worth that you noted?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'll start, Kevin, and the team can chime in. Versus our peers, again, our stage-length adjusted cost structure American versus our two largest competitors looks all-in-all reasonably close indeed if not around top of each other. But nonetheless we do think we have primarily due to the merger still some costs that we can reduce which is a big piece of this \u2013 again, the operational integration getting completed, that's $300 million we talk about. So, that's the biggest thing that we have that they don't. There are differences between carriers. We have higher ownership costs, because we have new aircraft. They have higher fuel and maintenance costs because they have older airplanes things like that. But when you add it all up, our costs per ASM on a stage-adjusted basis for the three airlines all look awfully similar at this point in time.","Kevin Crissey - Citi","Okay, thanks. And when we think about the specials, they're still a significant number. And I know you've had obviously the merger and you had the fleet restructuring, but it's a large number and it's been a large number for quite a while. How should we think about that? And I know you can't necessarily predict it, but it's a relatively consistently large number. Is that something that we should think about going away over time because you're running at kind of $0.5 billion to $1 billion a year?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. Look, absolutely, you should think of it is going away, because it should. But I just note that they're real numbers of course. And we did just do this large operations integration that Robert talked about that took all sorts of training for if I sensed it would not have happened had we not done a merger. So, it's right and appropriate to pull it out as a special expense and yeah, it's nearly five years later, but that's when it happened.","So that number should now continue to come down certainly the merger related. We like other airlines to the extent there are fleet restructurings and things like that to continue which we don't anticipate. But we think it's always right for the benefit of our investors to point out those that feel like one-time events versus recurring events. So, hard to predict what those will be over time, but the merger-related expenses, absolutely, you'll see continue to go down and it should go away over the next couple of years.","Kevin Crissey - Citi","Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, Doug, I just want to come back to your response to Helane there on your relative underperformance this year. I guess, what are the concrete steps as you look into 2019 that you're taking to correct the relative underperformance in revenue and margins between your bigger peers here or your biggest peers?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay, again, and we're going to have others chime in. The biggest things in that, in the $1 billion of revenue initiatives are product segmentation, which again for the most part is Basic Economy and Premium Economy, but also having the ability to sell those in more channels and more easily to our customers. And again that's execution against initiatives that we have underway, and again not reinventing any wheel here. Those are areas that other carriers have that we just don't have yet, but we'll have into 2019.","The fleet reconfiguration, the harmonization of our fleet that continues and will be largely in place in 2019 is a good piece of that number, which we weren't able to do in 2018 as we didn't have the fleet reconfigure. And this international network restructuring that we keep talking about, that where we were flying some flights internationally at some pretty large losses like our Chicago to China routes that we've relocated. And then there's just all sorts of other smaller type initiatives, they add up to reasonably large numbers. That again, some of those are just getting a little catch-up because of what \u2013 as we've been going through our merger and other airlines had more time than we have. We get to items like, denied boarding, auction process being better automated than we have today.","So, a number of initiatives that we look at. Again, none of these things are taking share away from someone else, because we think our products going to be a whole lot better even though we do. It's all about being sure that the existing demand or the existing demand grown naturally is producing higher unit revenue because we're doing a better job of executing against those plans.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, I guess, is there a lot of urgency in the organization to drive higher profitability, is that a top priority for the team?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes, Brandon. And again, as I said in my comments, look, the fact that we're confident, please don't take as indifference. We have a huge performance-based culture around here. We have people very fired up. We certainly don't like seeing our earnings fall more than others, but we know why it is, we know what we need to do, we're highly confident, we have the right plans, right people in place and that's why we're confident in saying things like you're going to see the revenue outperformance that we like in 2019. You're going to see earnings improve in 2019 because we are focused on that.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","I'd just add, the confidence also comes just knowing that this is going to happen. So, when Doug talks about Premium Economy, we know that by the end of this year we will have our 777s completed. We know that by next summer, we will have our 787 fleet done. We know that by next summer that we're on track to have 50% of our 737 reconfigurations done.","Those are things that we absolutely know. We know that with the changes we've made in terms of network are now coming to fruition. While we talk about changes that we've made to Brazil, and we talk about changes that we've made to China, those are now just being put into the schedule. And then, as we take a look forward and again, numbers that we haven't included in that $1 billion, we know that those gates are going to come online. Those are on track. And so, the confidence here is rooted in really things that we're going to be executing on and we know they're on track.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate it, that should be good for the stock if that works.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brandon. We agree.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Dan.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. The multi-year CapEx outlook is very helpful. Doug, on the past call you offered a multi-year roadmap on debt and leverage. And I think the expectation was that leverage will begin to fall in 2019. Since then fuel -we've had higher fuel, margins have contracted. So, I'm hoping you or Derek could once again update us on the thought process here for leveraging each of the coming three years. Does it need to go higher before it begins to fall in 2020 and 2021?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Let me give you a generic answer, then Derek can provide any mathematical details he cares to provide. So, look, anyway, the issue on the debt is as follows. I mean, again, Derek to give you some estimates, I think, on what's happened already it is. We are indeed reducing somewhat, but yeah, earnings matter in any projections of course. But, to the extent of what we just described is accurate and we believe it is that is earnings improvement and CapEx declines what you should see is a natural de-levering, because, again, we didn't go at debt because we were trying to get some optimum debt level. We went net of debt because we were adding a lot of assets. And the best way to fund those assets was through some really efficient debt. And we thought and continue to believe that was in our shareholders' best interest.","So, as you move forward, and there isn't a need to continue to do aircraft transactions, you should expect us to pay off debt as it comes due and there's substantial amount that comes due in the next few years. Pay it off as it comes due. There's nothing we're going to go pay off in advance. It's all incredibly efficient debt, but as it comes due we'll pay it off and we won't replace it. So, we should expect a natural de-levering as we move forward with higher profitability and lower CapEx needs.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Don, Latin America has been very volatile absent a JV in the near to medium term. How do you solve for the shortfall versus peak revenue in the region? Are you seeing demand trends beginning to inflect and how long is it going to take to dig on the revenue hole there?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay. First of all, I know we talk about Latin. We often think about different piece of Latin, but Latin is a complicated part of business. So, Caribbean, Central America kind of Northern Rim markets excluding Venezuela have actually performed pretty well. The weakness that we've seen has been in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. And as we look forward into Brazil, we're taking capacity actions. We reduced capacity by 10% in September-October. And we're reducing capacity by 20% going forward in Brazil.","Mexico, we've seen a very tough environment there, particularly the pricing driven by capacity increases and some concerns probably over travel warnings. But as we look forward into the fourth quarter, we're seeing demand come back a bit. We mentioned in the call last year, we have a number of initiatives in the RM and sales space around kind of real off-peak load factor performance, and we're seeing some real improvements in the load factors in Mexico, as we look forward although the yield environment remains weak. So, overall, Latin America, we were down, in a revenue perspective, 1.6%. Parts of it are doing really well, parts of it that aren't doing well. And where we're not doing well we're focused on capacity and our load factor performance.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the timing, guys.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our question is from Andrew Tangel from The Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Hey. Good morning. How are you?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well. How are you?","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Hey, you indicated that American has lagged United and Delta on upselling and offering premium products to customers that tap into the higher potential revenue. Could you give us a better idea of why that is, what the holdup has been, and where else in your judgment you've not been fast enough to increase revenue?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'll let Don do that and having again, it's not like we haven't acted fast enough. The reality is this. We've been in the middle of an integration. We have all sorts of needs. So, I don't want to make it sound like anyone here hasn't been proactively working to get all sorts of things done. We do find ourselves today in a position where we are working on some initiatives that aren't yet complete that will allow us to do better than we are today. Go ahead Don and where we are versus others.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","We've actually done a pretty good job of growing our ancillary revenue streams. In the third quarter, ancillary revenues are up 18%. We re-launched our Main Cabin extra product in June. And since we've done that we've seen unit revenues for Main Cabin extra grow at 24%, but we see that we actually have more opportunity beyond that. And the big opportunity for us is, we haven't yet built out our infrastructure to be able to push offers out to customers effectively between time of booking and time of check-in. And that's a big window where we can put and so many offers in front of our customers to increase of ancillary revenue stream even more than we've been able to go do it and that's really an IT infrastructure question. We have a project underway. We expect to be able to be more effective in doing that in 2019.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Correct me if I'm wrong, Don. But particularly, bookings that are made outside of aa.com...","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","In third-party channels as well.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","...in third-party channels, Andrew, others have more ability to push out offers to their customers that are main third-party channels than we do today, but we'll get that corrected.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Okay. If I can one follow-up. This year, United has embarked on a growth plan, the regional flying with midcontinent hubs. How much market share have you lost to United as part of that? And how much of a threat or has that growth plan proven to American so far this year?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, again, first off, I don't know that we can like particularly say versus that. We certainly haven't seen any discernible market share shift. Probably the best way to answer that which I'll let Don do is, if to the extent we're seeing it versus anybody else would see it be in Chicago and just talk about how, what we're seeing in Chicago on a year-over-year basis.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","So the biggest overlap we have is in Chicago, but we flew our largest scheduled departure at Chicago that we've ever flown this summer. And as we look at our performance in Chicago, it was our highest year-over-year unit revenue producing hub. On the corporate side, our corporate revenue in Chicago is up 15%. Our share gap, the way we measure our corporate market share relative to our capacity, is actually up by 0.5 point, so that's also positive. We haven't lost a single corporate account in Chicago. So we feel pretty good about the way customers have stuck with us this year.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","All right, thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Conor Shine from Dallas Morning News. Your line is now open.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","I was just hoping to get a little bit of any color you guys can provide in terms of where you guys are in the employee restructuring. You guys announced earlier this summer, mostly targeted upper management. Has that been completed? Is there any sense of scale in terms of number of positions impacted or dollar figure that you guys could share on that?","Elise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, Conor. It's Elise. We're really pleased with how it went this past summer. Out of about 550 director and above employees, we had an uptake of about 100, which was higher than our expectation. And we're happy for those people who elected to move on but even happier with the people who renewed their vows and elected to stay. We're in the process of working through the rest of the levels now, and we're seeing good results there too. So stay tuned for more.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","When you say levels, have you gotten below the director level at this point in time?","Elise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We're still working through that.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Conor.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Koenig from The Associated Press. Your line is now open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi, David.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Good morning, folks. Most of my questions were asked and answered, but I did want to know. I think maybe Derek was looking for a figure when Doug was answering Helane Becker's question. Was there, first of all, ever a figure on how much fuel cost increase you are recapturing with fares and fees?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We don't have that number, I guess. Anyway, you can get it from analysts. Go ahead, Derek.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","It's 40%.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. 40%, thanks.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Calculated the same way that Delta and United have calculated.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","40%, okay. Thank you. And on the 1.5% to 3.5% TRASM guide for 4Q, how much would that be if you took out cargo and credit card and stuff like that? How much would the PRASM part of it be?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We actually just don't look at it that way. These things are all really interrelated. And so we focus on our TRASM number.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay, all right. Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is now open.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Hi, good morning. I had a question just about labor in general. If you could, just give us an update on what's going on with the mechanics. You have pilot negotiations, I think, coming up soon. Also, there have been a bunch of protests with some of the regional employees too, and you gave a pay raise I think it was like a year and a half ago that you've first announced it. Is it possible to give further pay increases to your employees going forward?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'll do an overview, and then Steve can fill in any blanks if there are any.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thank you, Leslie. So on our fleet service and mechanics, the IAM-TWU partnership \u2013 association I should say, negotiations, as soon as those contracts became amendable, the company asked that we go to the National Mediation Board for assistance. We just haven't been able, despite everyone's best efforts, to get that contract closed up. And we think it makes sense for the National Mediation Board to bring us there to get us there.","So that's done. That we think is a very positive development. So it's now in the hands of the National Mediation Board to actually oversee those negotiations, and that will begin shortly. So hopefully that will bring us to the conclusion that we weren't able to get done with the parties themselves.","We do have, at the end of 2019, our flight attendant and pilot contracts become amendable, so we'll open those negotiation sometime in 2019. Those are five-year contracts that we've signed five years ago. So that's where it stands. All in all though, what I'll tell you is, the team is doing a great job. The leadership team has done a really nice job of taking care of our team and is making a huge difference in the way that our team is now taking care of our customers. And we're really happy with the way all that is done, and we hope to get these negotiations all completed as they come due.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","And is it possible to get some of the workers will get an increase in pay? I know that there are some outside the mechanics and...","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'm sorry, are you asking about the regional carriers? Steve on the wholly-owned subsidiaries?","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Yeah.","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure, we have several negotiations going on with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. But the two leading ones are the negotiations with our ground employees at Envoy and Piedmont. One of those has been agreed with the union and is out for ratification now. The second of those, I would expect to be concluded as soon as the first ratifies. And there are pretty big pay increases built into those, the tentative agreement for the first and what we have on the table for the second.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Biers from AFP. Your line is now open.","John Biers - Agence-France Presse","Thanks very much for taking the question. This has come up in the other calls as well, but the strength of corporate traveling has been a positive for the airline industry of late. Do you think the growth in that area is sustainable? Are we peaking? Has it peaked? What's your sense there? And are you seeing any kind of breakout, is corporate travel stronger within the U.S. domestically, or is it also very strong overseas?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay, this is Don Casey. Corporate travel has been very strong this year. It's been broad-based. It's been across really all of the industrial areas that we focus on. The early indicators for next year based on surveys that other bodies do is that the expectation is that corporate traffic will remain strong into next year and that it will likely grow.","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And, Don, I'd add just add too. As we take a look going forward, I know that we see opportunities in continuing to engage with small and medium-sized businesses. We have an AAirpass program that really appeals to really very small accounts, and we see great traction there. So there's continued opportunity for us to expand how we connect with businesses, especially smaller businesses.","John Biers - Agence-France Presse","Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is now open.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Close again. Hey, I just needed to clarify two things please. On the fuel cost recapture, was the timeframe on that third quarter or year to date, the 40%?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","That's year to date.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay, great.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","That's year to date.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Thank you. And, Elise, on the buyouts or whatever you all are calling them, do you expect those to go below management levels? Will we see any like front-line employees at that level affected?","Elise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No, Mary. This was an exercise to go through post-integration and look at our management head count and make a reduction of roughly 5%, Derek.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. And, Mary, sorry about that. That's just third quarter. The 40% is just the third quarter recapture, not full year.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Not year to date, just third quarter.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Great, thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Mary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tracy Rucinski from Reuters. Your line is now open. Tracy, your line is now open. And our next question is from Ted Reed from Forbes. Your line is now open.","Ted Reed - Forbes Media LLC","Hey, thank you. Hi, thank you. My question is for Robert. I know you're working hard now to improve operations, but your operations seem to be in leadership a couple years ago and they since seemed to have deteriorated. Why have your operations been deteriorating the past couple years? Is it just weather, or is it something more?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No, Ted. First off, I'd just go back and we've been at merging the airline, integrating a lot of different areas over the past number of years. But as I said in my comments, in terms of our core operating reliability, but for the really major events, we've been pleased with modest continued improvement in those things that are really important to our customers and drive customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend scores.","And again, as we took a look into this year, we've been making steady progress and then springtime summer we fell off. We think there are some reasons behind it, a lot of additional work, some other one-time issues. But at the end of the day, we need to do a better job of making sure that we're prepared for peak season that we have aircraft available first thing in the morning and that we do a good job of turning them throughout the day.","Those are basics, we're good at that. I know that as we progress through the summer and really have everybody take a look at what went on, we'll get back to the track that we were on. And so, I look at this as more of a blip and something that as I look into 2019, will be certainly more of a strength and an opportunity for efficiency and improvement to the P&L. So, upside for us.","Ted Reed - Forbes Media LLC","All right. I just don't have a clear sense of why it fell off.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, so, I'd point to a few things. Certainly, inclement weather is something that is always an issue, but that's not a focus area. At the start of the summer, we had a lot of extra work, inspecting 600-and-some-odd CFM 56-7 engines, fan blades that hadn't been expected. We had an inordinate number of engine changes with some of the newer aircraft deliveries that we're working with the aircraft manufacturers on making sure that we get a fix for that in the long run.","And then I'd say that on some of the fleets that we're retiring our super 80 fleet that was something that it took a little bit more work than we had anticipated. But you put all that together and no excuses, that's something that we can plan for and do better and we have. And we are and we have and we'll make sure that we cover as we get into, peak season is coming up.","Ted Reed - Forbes Media LLC","All right. Thank you, I appreciate it.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Ted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Your line is now open.","Robert Silk - Travel Weekly","Thank you. So, you all mentioned that commission payout that sort of flattened this year, but there were big jumps last year like more than 30% and you're still up about 8%, I think, through the first half of this year on commission payments, and you're not alone in doing in that. What in general has driven just the higher commission payouts across the industry?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","This is Doug. And as Don said, it's competitive. So, anyway, it's a competitive business and there are really three of us that compete mostly in this. And if someone decides they want to really go after the business and do it through higher commissions, we need to be competitive. So that's what's been happening. And as we've seen other carriers in an effort to win back some business they've lost lower commissions, and we need to compete for that. I expect as you see things normalize that'll change.","Robert Silk - Travel Weekly","Is there been any sort of \u2013 as you all concentrate more on segmentation and on driving process in the front of the plane, has there been any sort of recognition that's driven the desire to reward agencies more the deal with these high-end customers?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","No. Clearly, we're all focused on high value customers, right, and customers they're going to pay higher fares on average. And a lot of our activity in our sales organization is really B2B activity, focused on corporate customers and agencies that drive a lot of that business. And that revenue is growing, as I said, at a very, very strong pace right now.","Robert Silk - Travel Weekly","Thanks, guys.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Robert.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Excellent. All right.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. In the room with us or joining us in the call this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for question-and-answer session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.","We're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on our first quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with a commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our press release that was issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is including in the earnings press release and that can be found on our website at aa.com.","A webcast of this will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thanks, again, for joining us.","At this point, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan, and thanks from everybody with us. We reported this morning first quarter results of $357 million income, excluding net special items, that's $0.75 per share, thanks to the hard working people at American Airlines, who are doing a phenomenal job of taking care of our teams and keeping us on track with all of our strategic initiatives.","We feel very good about where we're now. Those earnings, of course, are down year-over-year, that's driven by an increase in fuel year-over-year, which Derek will talk about. And indeed that fuel prices have increased yet again just in the last \u2013 since we closed the quarter. So, we've adjusted our full year earnings estimate accordingly.","Excluding the fuel price increase, is as I say though everything else feels very good at American. We continue to work against our strategic objectives and made really nice progress in each of those. First, in creating a world-class customer experience. We continue to bring in new aircraft, retire older airplanes in what is the most aggressive modernization of aircraft fleet in the history of commercial aviation continues, with our aircraft age now well below those of our large competitors.","We put in place the best property, the best lounge product ever created by a U.S. carrier with Flagship Lounges in Miami, LA, JFK, Chicago, coming soon to Dallas. We've, with the introduction of the Boeing 737 MAX's, we now have satellite Wi-Fi on domestic aircraft, something that will be continued to roll out through the entire fleet through 2019, just a huge advancement in the product for our customers allowing customers to stream.","Everyone in the aircraft can stream at the same time, much different than the ground-based Wi-Fi that is in place on most of the American fleet and most of the industry' fleet today. So that work continues as we well know as far our customers on making culture a competitive advantage, a huge initiative in American. That continues, of course. In this quarter, we accrued $29 million for profit sharing for our team during the quarter.","But leading forward is the biggest announcement in that regard for the quarter was the aircraft restructuring that we announced earlier in the quarter, which positions us for the future extremely well as it relates to our fleet addressing a couple of the issues that remained with our widebody fleet and pushing off some Boeing 737s, that \u2013 they're allowing us to leave in the fleets of aircraft that weren't quite range retired.","And then lastly, on ensuring long-term financial strength, the earnings, in spite of those fuel price increases, contribute well to that initiative. We returned $498 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We now have done $11.9 billion, $11 billion of which are share repurchases since the program was announced in mid-2014. And we announced yet again today a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by December 31, 2020. So the team's done an amazing job on hitting on all cylinders.","I'll let Derek now talk about \u2013 give you more details on those financials and Robert will give you more details on the operations and revenue performance.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Good. All right. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to recognize and thank our team members who did a great job looking after our customers despite some very difficult weather events over the past few months. Even in the face of some very challenging operational conditions, their hard work allowed us to continue showing the strong revenue growth that we have achieved in recent quarters.","We filed our first quarter earnings press release and 10-Q this morning. And as a reminder, on January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting standards relating to revenue recognition as well as the income statement classification of certain pension and benefit costs. As a result, our 2017 statement of operations was recast to reflect these changes. All the period over period comparisons I will talk about today are based on these recast results. Just refer to the first quarter 2018 10-Q filed this morning as well as our 8-K filed January 25, 2018 for our recast 2017 financial statements.","Higher fuel prices led to a decline in year-over-year earnings. Our first quarter 2018 GAAP net profit was $186 million or $0.39 per diluted share, as compared to our first quarter 2017 GAAP net profit of $340 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding net special items, we reported a net profit of $357 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus our first quarter 2017 net profit excluding special items of $414 million.","Our diluted earnings per share excluding net special items was $0.75, $0.03 better than analyst consensus. The winter storms I mentioned earlier in my remarks resulted in more than 8,000 flight cancellations primarily in the Northeast, and these negatively impacted first quarter earnings by approximately $42 million.","On a pre-tax basis, our GAAP first quarter pre-tax profit was $273 million. Excluding net special items, our first quarter pre-tax profit was $468 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 4.5%.","For the sixth consecutive quarter, we achieved positive unit revenue growth. Total operating revenues were 5.9% year-over-year to a first quarter record $10.4 billion. Passenger revenues were up 5.4% to $9.5 billion on a 1.5% improvement in yields.","Our cargo team continues to produce excellent results. Our fleet transformation over the past few years has led to significant up-gauging, which allows us to transport more cargo around our network. This contributed to a 10.9% increase in volume in the first quarter. This increase in traffic, when coupled with an improved global economy, enabled us to grow our cargo revenues by 18.8% to $227 million in the first quarter on a 7.1% increase in yields.","Other operating revenues were $694 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by revenues associated with our loyalty program.","Total GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $10 billion, up 9.8% versus the same quarter last year. This increase was driven primarily by a $441 million increase in consolidated fuel expenses. Had fuel prices remained unchanged versus the first quarter 2017, our total expenses would have been $412 million lower.","Higher salaries and benefits expenses resulted from the mid-contract base pay increase given to our pilots and flight attendants in April of 2017, also contributed to the increase in expenses.","As a result, consolidated CASM was $0.1515 in the first quarter of 2018, up 7.3% year-over-year, and our consolidated CASM, ex-fuel and special items, was $0.1157, up 2.8% year-over-year. This was lower than the guidance we provided earlier in the year, due primarily to the timing of certain maintenance expenses, which shifted from the first quarter to the second quarter.","We ended the quarter with approximately $7.8 billion in total available liquidity, well above our $7 billion target minimum. The company also has a restricted cash position of $294 million.","During the quarter, we completed sale leaseback transactions on the 16 remaining 2018 mainline new deliveries. In addition, we extended our financing commitment with Vendus (10:24) to finance the 10 [Embraer] ERJ-175s delivered later this year and in early 2019. We now have all of our aircraft deliveries in 2018 financed.","The company made dividend payments of $48 million and repurchased 4.8 million (sic) [8.4 million] (10:41) shares at a cost of $450 million in the first quarter. Since our share repurchase program started in 2014, we have bought back $11 billion of stock. Our buyback as well as the net issuance of stock and cash extinguishment of convertible debt has reduced our share count by 38% to 467.4 million shares outstanding as of March 31.","We also announced in our earnings release this morning that the board has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization for completion by the end of 2020.","We filed an investor update this morning, which included our guidance for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect our 2018 capacity to be up approximately 2.5% on a schedule-over-schedule basis or approximately 3% on a schedule-over-actual basis. By region, we expect our 2018 system capacity to be up approximately 3% domestically and 2.5% internationally.","We also guided to a second quarter 2018 TRASM forecast increase of 1.5% to 3.5%, and Robert will provide more color on the trends we are seeing in the revenue environment.","I also want to tell you more about our One Airline initiative, the company wide project that we discussed at our Media and Investor Day last fall. One Airline is designed to ensure we derive the maximum benefit from the efficiency opportunities created by the merger.","We are forecasted on driving lower cost across the business \u2013 are focused on driving lower cost across the business and have identified opportunities in a number of diverse areas, such as simply returning unused airport space, freed up by co-locations and other post-merger changes; shifting a portion of our higher cost regional affiliate flying to lower \u2013 our lower cost wholly-owned subsidiaries; and new projects such as our dynamic re-accom [re-accommodation] project, which enables customers to rebook themselves on the flight of their choice in the event of irregular operations, which in turn, reduces pressure on our reservation call centers.","I mentioned on the last earnings call that we expected our One Airline initiative to generate approximately $250 million of cost reductions in 2018, which is $50 million higher than our expectations at our Investor Day. We're excited by the opportunities that we have identified through this process for 2018, and expect more than $1 billion in cost reductions over the next few years.","We continue to anticipate that our unit cost growth rate, excluding fuel and special items, will be approximately 2% for 2018, excluding the impact of any new labor agreements. Due to timing of expenses moving out of the first quarter, we anticipate the CASM growth will now peak in the second quarter of 2018, at up 2.5% to 4.5% year-over-year with the rate of CASM declining each quarter after that.","Based on the forward curve, as of April 20, we are forecasting a 30% increase year-over-year of consolidated fuel expense in 2018 or an increase of $2.3 billion. For the full year, we now anticipate our fuel price to be between $2.16 to $2.21 per gallon. With these higher forecasted fuel prices, we expect our second quarter of 2018 pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, to be between 7.5% and 9. 5%.","Since we gave our EPS guide in early April, higher fuel costs have driven an increase of approximately $0.65 per share, therefore, we are also updating our 2018 earnings per diluted share, excluding net special items guidance to be between $5 and $6 a share.","Our CapEx plans for 2018 remain unchanged as we continue to expect to commit $1.8 billion in non-aircraft CapEx projects, with gross aircraft CapEx and PDPs of $1.9 billion. All of our new aircraft deliveries are designed to replace older fleet retirements.","Since our last call, we have announced a significant change in our aircraft delivery plans. Following negotiations with Boeing and Airbus, we announced earlier this month that we canceled our order for 22 Airbus A350 aircraft, and expect to take delivery of additional 22 Boeing 787-8s and 25 Boeing 787-9 aircraft between 2020 and 2026. These aircraft will replace our Boeing 767s, Airbus A330-300s and certain older seven \u2013 Boeing 777-200 aircraft. Boeing is also committed to provide operating lease financing for the 787-8 deliveries.","In addition, as Doug said, we agreed with Boeing to defer the delivery of 40 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from between 2020 and 2022 to 2025 and 2026, and agreed with Airbus to defer three A321neo aircraft from 2021 to 2023. These changes further simplify our fleet and better align our aircraft delivery stream with our replacement needs. They also significantly reduce our planned CapEx, aircraft CapEx for 2019 and 2020. We now expect our aircraft CapEx for 2019 to be $2.5 billion with $1.7 billion expected for 2020.","We will continue to work with the aircraft manufacturers to find mutually-beneficial opportunities to fine-tune our delivery schedule to meet our network needs.","With respect to our pension obligations, we plan to make contributions of approximately 450 \u2013 sorry, $465 million in 2018, which will allow us to maintain the funded status of our plans at 80% for 2018. Roughly $207 million has been contributed through April 2018. So in conclusion, I'd like to once again thank our entire team for another excellent quarter. Your hard work is the foundation of our continued success.","And with that, I will turn it over to Robert.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Like both Doug and Derek, I'd like to thank our team members for their impressive work throughout the quarter. They worked through challenging weather conditions, including an unprecedented four Nor'easter storms in the first 20 days of March. And as Derek said, during the quarter, we canceled more than 8,000 main line and regional flights due to severe weather.","This past winter, our Philadelphia and Chicago O'Hare hubs de-iced on nearly 80 days each. Throughout it all, our front-line teams did a great job of taking care of customers despite the difficult conditions and once again, demonstrated to the world what collaboration and teamwork means. So again, thanks from all of us.","During the first quarter, we made tremendous progress on many of our commercial initiatives that we outlined in our Media and Investor Day last fall. As part of that plan, we said that we'd take advantage of the power of our hubs and gateways, strengthen out the domestic network and leverage our existing and potential partnerships to improve our international network.","Domestically, we will launch new service to seven markets this summer. These markets not only strengthen the cities with new service, but will also add more connecting routes to our network. For example, the addition of twice-daily from Panama City, Florida to our hubs in Charlotte and DFW, add more than 175 potential O&Ds to our network. The additional of new destinations like Panama City is just one example of how we can unleash the power of our global network which not only has new destinations for our customers but also drive new, margin-accretive, high-quality revenue into our network.","Another objective that we outlined was to focus our network where we believe we a have competitive advantage, which is our hubs. In Chicago, we recently opened five new gates that allow us to offer a richer pattern of service for our customers. We also reached an agreement with DFW to get access to additional gates in Terminal E. This allows us to have departures at our largest hub, enabling more customers to access our global network. Over time, and when these changes are complete, we'll operate more than 900 daily departures in DFW.","Lastly, in Charlotte, we continue to look for opportunities to add profitable growth and recently we announced that we gained access to seven additional gates, which are expected to start going into service in the fall of 2019 and beyond.","We have also enhanced the travel experience between our New York, La Guardia, and Chicago for our business customers by adding that route to our Seattle portfolio. The Seattle is well-known among our business and top travelers, and offers an hourly schedule dedicated, gates, dedicated check-in areas, complimentary meals at mealtimes and first class to and from Chicago, O'Hare. The Free Spirit and First Class, complementary snacks, beer and wine in all cabins.","In addition, we recently filed a new application with the U.S. Department of Transportation in February, requesting antitrust immunity for our proposed joint venture with Qantas that will cover our North American and Australia and New Zealand operations. We're excited for this opportunity and look forward to its approval.","With respect to our co-brand program, we are really seeing the benefits of our dual issuer model with very strong double-digit year-over-year growth and acquisitions in the first quarter. Our total card spend continues to significantly outpace GDP growth and the growth in our overall program benefits to American grew measurably in the first quarter of 2018 and is on track with our expectations.","Our sales initiatives continue to produce strong revenue growth in the corporate segment. In particular, we saw an acceleration of small- to medium-sized corporate account acquisitions, floor performance remains positive with our corporate accounts.","We continue to methodically expand Basic Economy, which has been effectively rolled out in the U.S. and certain markets in the Caribbean, Mexico and now across the Atlantic. We are seeing strong upsell up to our main cabin product, with conversion rates now in excess of 60%. We expect further market expansion will follow as we measure our operational and revenue performance. In addition, our highly differentiated Premium Economy product is now installed on 81 widebody aircraft and it's being sold on 58 routes at an average fare that is double the coach cabin fare.","Turning to revenue. Our first quarter revenue was up 5.9% year-over-year, and was a record for the first quarter, with 3.5% year-over-year TRASM improvement. Our international performance is very strong due to solid overall demand, improved premium cabin performance, favorable currency impact and Easter shifting to an earlier date compared to 2017.","Domestic unit revenue was positive as well driven by improved load factor. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for this system and the second quarter in a row, where all geographic entities had positive PRASM growth. Much of this improvement is directly attributable to the significant investments we have made over the past few years in our product and operation, as well as the world-class team we have assembled that continues to execute.","Our Latin American performance was very strong, with PRASM up 12%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. Strength was broad-based with Brazil and Mexico improving in mid-single digits and all other entities improving by double-digits.","Atlantic unit revenue was up 2%. Importantly, our underlying coupon performance improved by 8.6%, but we have headwinds this quarter due to the timing of joint business settlements. Premium demand remains strong while coach pricing improved year-over-year. Currency added 4.5 points to Atlantic performance.","Pacific PRASM was up 3.1% year-over-year, on basis of improved premium cabin performance. Hong Kong and Japan were our strongest markets year-over-year.","In domestic, our consolidated PRASM was up 2%. On a year-over-year basis, our top-performing hubs were Miami and DFW. PRASM from close-in bookings was positive driven by Basic Economy and strong corporate demand.","First quarter cargo revenue improved 18.8% year-over-year on both strong volume and yield, continuing the positive trend we've seen since the second half of 2016. Our other revenue was up by 10% driven by increased revenues associated with our loyalty program.","Looking forward, we are seeing strong demand for our product both domestically and internationally. On a year-over-year basis, our comps get materially harder as the second quarter of 2017 was up significantly higher than our peers. However, our ongoing and future commercial initiatives will continue to drive revenue growth. We expect our year-over-year TRASM to be up 1.5% to 3.5% in the second quarter. This will mark the seventh quarter in a row of positive unit revenue growth for American.","Consistent with the last two quarters, we expect positive unit revenue growth across our network, led by the Atlantic, followed by Pacific and Latin America. As we head into the busy summer travel period, we are encouraged with the economic environment and the strength that we see in passenger demand. We remain focused on the long-term, and we'll make smart investments and expand margins that drive value for our company. We're proud of our accomplishments thus far, and we look forward to the future.","And with that said, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go first to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning everyone.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Robert, can you give us a little bit more color around where your corporate negotiated rates are right now? Can you maybe give us some reference to where they are relative to prior peak and have you even seeing a traction accelerate of late on corporate pricing?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'm going to let \u2013 I'm looking at Don here to...","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes. I mean the market, corporate market continues to be pretty competitive and we're seeing much stronger close-in unit revenue growth. And part of that is related to kind of corporate and business market. In the first quarter, our total revenue related to business travel, it's with our (24:54) corporates, was actually up 7%. So we're seeing quite strong demand. And part of that 7% growth was an increase in average ticket value. So we're seeing the yields and average values go up.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And Doug, I guess, what's it going to take to get back into the $5 billion kind of pre-tax income range that you talk about as being almost a baseline earnings number. Is there anything that the team can do to offset this higher fuel right now, because it just seems like maybe some of the domestic capacity out there in the schedules might keep a little bit of a lid on pricing? So is there anything that you can do accelerate on the cost side to help try to get back towards that $5 billion number?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. The answer, of course, is yes. And we can talk about this. Because let me just talk in first about kind of what's going on here and what it does to earnings. The reality is \u2013 I'll start with this. At this level of fuel price, I'm highly confident American Airlines could produce $5 billion of pre-tax earnings. Not right now.","But what I'm getting at is this fuel price increase is one of these that's happened very quickly, and it takes time to \u2013 for what's required to get \u2013 to react to that to take place, a lot of which is capacity changes, as you know.","So anyway, the facts are these, since last summer, oil prices have increased over 60%. That's a big increase over a short period of time. And the last 12% of that's happened in the last two weeks.","So that kind of an increase is going to have a material \u2013 is going to have an impact on airline financials. And you don't see the impact in revenues as that happens. The way revenues respond of course is through either higher fares, higher revenue, PRASM, as you know. So that's what I think.","And look, the one good thing, I guess, about higher fuel prices, is it affects everybody. We all end up in the industry, needing to pay for fuel, of course. And as it increases, all of our costs increase. And indeed, the lower cost carriers' costs increase at a greater rate. That's because their cost increase of course has nothing to do with fuel prices. It's all about having a lesser product and about paying people less.","So as fuel prices increase, their costs increase at a \u2013 greater than rest of us. And the good news on that is those are the carriers that are growing the fastest, and those are the carriers that are the price leaders.","So again, none of that has happened yet. We don't see it yet. But my strong view is that if this is where fuel prices are going to stay for an extended period of time, you'll see those types of things respond.","Going back to your $5 billion number \u2013 our number \u2013 what we believe kind of steady-state pre-tax earnings for this business are in a normal year. The number's there, it's just you obviously don't meet that number. But if our \u2013 if we had simply the same fuel price in our 2018 forecast, the 2017 one, Derek told you $2.3 billion of higher fuel, some of that is higher number of gallons, but a very small amount, $300 million of the $2.3 billion. $2 billion of the increase in our fuel price estimate for 2018 is driven entirely by higher prices.","So if indeed that hadn't happened (28:37) not suggesting revenues wouldn't be somewhat different if fuel prices were exactly the same. But you all would have numbers that have us over $5 billion in 2018 earnings.","So that's what's going on. Fuel prices have risen very quickly, and it takes time to adapt. I view that as a near-term problem, not a long-term problem, one that will get addressed in the long-term, one that the industry can certainly handle over time, but it doesn't happen immediately.","And just like when oil prices fell precipitously, whenever that was, three or four years ago, and you saw earnings increase, only to have capacity start to come in and then revenues to fall, I suspect as it goes back up like this, there is a lag effect as well.","So finally, to your question, what can we do about it, our \u2013 the main thing is \u2013 we certainly \u2013 look, we're doing everything we can on costs and we'll \u2013 if there was more that we thought made sense, we would have done it already. We don't have anything that's \u2013 now that fuel prices are higher, let's stop doing something that didn't make sense before.","We're already going after this. So I don't want to lead you to believe there's \u2013 that we would go and increase or be able to reduce other costs in some material fashion. We'll certainly go do a relook to make sure there's nothing out there that we can't do even faster than Derek described.","The way you deal with this primarily is on the revenue side. As our cost of production goes up, the cost of travel should go up in some way. We're not the price leaders in a lot of markets. So we'll see what happens. But none of the forecasts that we talk about anticipates that.","So we'll see. But it would certainly seem logical, you see over time. And you see, in our capacity guidance, no change from the last capacity guidance. That's because, as we look out, first off, in the very near term, right into the peak summer schedule, and definitely not in our shareholders' best interest for us to be reducing capacity, as we head into the best part of the year.","But as we look beyond that, we will certainly take a look on \u2013 at whether or not \u2013 again assuming fuel prices stay at this level, what's the right level of capacity. And in our case, we're growing less than the others. So there's \u2013 I'm not suggesting that \u2013 I mean we adjust as well. But certainly when you're talking about having less growth, those that are growing the least have less ability to make a large difference.","But we certainly will look at ours, make sure that things like utilization flying that we've been adding in, does it still make as much sense? And look at the fleet as well.","So that's where the real leverage is, is in the capacity. And I do believe, as we move forward, if indeed this is the steady state level of fuel prices, you'll see less capacity growth that people are talking about right now.","Operator","We'll go next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Jamie.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm not sure who wants to take this, but why shouldn't the ancillary revenue line also include revenue associated with domestic fuel surcharges? I mean, I get that they're not permitted at the moment, but what I don't understand is why the industry isn't pushing to change this? Airlines want to be compared to other high-quality industrial transports, at least I think they do. But those companies are permitted to levy fuel surcharges. You kick-started industry consolidation. I mean, why isn't this another area where American could take a leadership position?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We're all looking at each other. Who wants to answer this?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","At the end of the day, it all hits the customer. And so it's a matter of being competitive in our offering. And so we're conscious of that. And we've got to be \u2013 ensure that we're incredibly competitive in terms of the pricing that we offer all-in.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. And Jamie, look, I could be wrong on this, but I don't think it will make a big difference in the actual price, this implies. It would just be a delineation, and one that we'd need to be moving around, is fuel prices. We know the right answer is to price your product in line with your cost of production. And whether or not it's played out the fuel surcharge or not, as Robert says, the cost \u2013 what matters is what the customer's willing to bear. And we should \u2013 again, certainly, we should all work to set our prices accordingly. We can't \u2013 we can't...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But don't you think that the pace of revenue recovery would be hastened, it would be faster if surcharge mechanisms were in place?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. I don't know. I guess it's a fair question, but I don't think it's material. I don't think it'll have a material impact on revenues over time, and so it's not something that we've been pushing for.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And second for Robert, low-cost carriers have announced capacity reductions for next year, which most of them have. They're still growing but at a retarded rate. In your mind, is this evidence, the base of the economy is having an impact? I mean ULCC is obviously disagreeing with that, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're right. Do you have any opinion on this?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Whether the base economy is affecting the ULCCs?","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And whether that potentially lies at the root of their decision to reduce capacity next year.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Jamie, we can't talk about why others may or may not change their capacity. If you're asking about...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","...whether we think \u2013 if you're asking about whether we think the Basic Economy price is having an impact on ULCCs? Of course, it is. Well \u2013 but prior to Basic Economy, we were matching them across the board. So, and that was having an impact. The real impact on Basic Economy is back to 10 years, but we can actually \u2013 we have a product out there for those customers who don't want to purchase that product, where they can pay a little more and have a more \u2013 a slightly improved products or largely improved products. So anyway, that's helped us more than them. What is impacting ULCCs, I would imagine, is the fact that American and other airlines have dedicated themselves to making sure we're going into be competitive on price probably for \u2013 at any fair level they chose to go to.","Jamie, left.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Next.","Operator","We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, good morning.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Robert, just on the 15 extra gates at DFW. Can you just talk about what that means for Phoenix going forward? It would seem like those 15 gates could accommodate a lot of the flying being done through Phoenix. So how should we think about that?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","At least right now, I'd tell you, the two aren't connected. We know that we have profitable opportunities in the long run in DFW, and these additional gates which I think are going to create a nice regional opportunity and thereby also create some \u2013 free up some capacity for other main line aircraft as well. I think it creates a nice opportunity for the growth that we do have in the future. And as we take a look whether it's DFW or Charlotte, those are great opportunities for us to build on our strategy that we've outlined, which is to make sure that our network is focused on our hubs and gateways and that we expand the places where we have the greatest competitive advantage. And right now that is absolutely focused on DFW and Charlotte.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. And like I said, Phoenix is doing well. And if you \u2013 relative to other hub performances, Phoenix is performing nicely, so nothing about that makes us think we should do \u2013 we should be doing anything with the Phoenix hub other than continuing to do much like it's doing today. We just think there's opportunities to doing more in Dallas and Charlotte.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then Robert, you've mentioned before that you view the loyalty program and kind of selling miles as another distribution channel that the airline has. It would seem like a very good one, just given how opaque it can be. But I guess my question is, why not use it more \u2013 I get these e-mails offering to sell me miles pretty frequently, it's always a horrible exchange rate. And I don't understand anyone \u2013 why anyone would buy those miles. Why not offer consumers a fair rate to get their dollars into your ecosystem and kind of leverage that distribution channel more effectively?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We think that we're using the channel and the program appropriately. It's designed to attract and retain customers, and then a tremendous amount of utility is offered by expanding through the relationships that we've been able to establish with the co-brand cards and other partners.","We look for opportunities, but we think we're making smart decisions. And in the areas that we see growth, especially with the co-brand cards, we think we're doing the right thing and are really confident in enhancements in those products that we see coming throughout the rest of this year and beyond.","Operator","We'll go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning. Hey, guys. Hey, Doug. So, I realize that this might be a timing issue, and if it is, you can please tell me that. But can you help me understand the rationale for lowering the earnings guide on fuel and then not concurrently at the same time reducing some of that incrementally on productive capacity, or is it just sort of like a timing mismatch between the reporting cycle and capacity planning?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. That's a good question, and I try to answer \u2013 I can do it better now with a more direct question. The answer, yeah, we \u2013 yes, we \u2013 look, just yesterday, as we get ready for our earnings call, it's at a new fuel price, and it's gone up from two weeks we last did it enough that we begin like 12% since \u2013 in the last two weeks.","So that led to the EPS guide, and we haven't yet made decisions on capacity that I talked about. But there won't be any, by the way, Hunter, for this summer, nor should there be. So to the extent there are going to be any \u2013 we'll look to do as we start to build our fall schedule and we don't have anything to report on that yet. So does it mean that we're \u2013 you should expect that if fuel prices stay here, we won't make changes. But it's also, there's nothing for us to tell you right now as to what those will be.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then Derek, couple of years ago, on one of these calls, you said we should expect roughly flat interest expense over the next five years. But since then, your margins and earnings have been cut in half. Is there a \u2013 basically cut in half. Is there a thought to redressing that view now that sort of the margin for error above the line is so much thinner?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No. Oh, go ahead Doug.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, no. Sorry. I was just \u2013 Derek said no, and then I'll provide some color, which is \u2013 I mean, part and parcel of it, Jamie is...","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hunter...","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hunter, whoever you are.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","I've been called worse.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'm sorry, yes. You have. I'm sorry, Hunter. So anyway, the \u2013 look, the question, of course, if you're asking about lower interest expenses is about (40:23). And we feel really comfortable with our capital structure. In good or bad times, that's why we have it set this way. The way we protect against bad times is by carrying a whole lot of cash, and we continue to do so. More than our competitors, we don't think the right thing for our shareholders is to go pay down incredibly efficient debt, and which is what we have right now.","We're paying down \u2013 we pay down debt and have paid down all the higher cost debt, but the debt we're adding now is tied to \u2013 the other point I would make, of course, is we have much higher asset values than our other competitors because of the new aircraft. So there's a reason for the higher debt and it's financed \u2013 it really get rich, we think it's in the best interest of our shareholders to make sure that we avail ourselves of those rates certainly much lower than the cost of equity. And do so \u2013 and then to protect ourselves against any sort of downturn by holding more cash dollars. We like that structure, we think it's best for our shareholders, we think it's best for America and our team.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, gentlemen.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Doug, not to beat you up on the fuel and capacity question. But you make a pretty compelling argument about higher fuel leading to lower capacity but how do you reconcile that with last year where we've actually seen the opposite lower, high \u2013 we have lower capacity and now higher capacity, as fuel has moved up, and help me out with that.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'll try. To be clear, when I said the capacity would adjust to higher fuel prices over time, I don't think they'll be less capacity. I think there'll be less capacity than there would have been otherwise. So it's hard to know what would have happened to capacity had fuel prices stayed where they were. But I do believe \u2013 and I would certainly agree with you, as fuel prices had risen, even through the back half of last year, I don't think you saw changes in people's capacity adjustment. My own personal view on that is, it ramped pretty quickly, and I don't know that everyone really believed that we're going to stay there.","So if you're going to make capacity adjustments or \u2013 a lot \u2013 it requires some belief that out into the future, I think the belief out into the future about oil prices was probably one of \u2013 well, they ran up in a hurry, but there were a lot of fundamental reasons why they could go back to where they've been for the last few years. If indeed now we see they just continue to grow, I can tell you, I think, from our perspective and, therefore, I imagine for almost everyone, it leads you start questioning whether or not this is where we're going to be.","This is where we are and there need to be adjustments, so that's what I think. I think you're going to see it run, and you can see changes that ran up in the back half of last year, largely because it was unclear as to whether or not that was the new normal. This is feeling somewhat more like the new normal. So we need to adjust our business plans accordingly.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks, Doug. And then another question for you. Historically, you've done a pretty good job of taking advantage of the volatility in your stock. And you've even showed that in some of your presentations. And we've seen that again more recently with the weakness in your stock. I mean, would you consider doing what you did before, which is sort of lever up, buy back your stock and sort of take advantage of these dislocations, if you will, or do you feel like leverages is a bit full now relative to where you want it to be. Maybe that's a question for Derek as well.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. Well, first up, to be clear, I wouldn't describe what we did as levering up to our stock. It is not what we did. We increased the debt on the company. And as we acquired new long-life assets, which were aircraft and we did that at really efficient rates.","So, and at the same time, we had after earnings and making sure we're taking care of our team and taking care of the exceptional amount of pent-up demand for capital in this airline, after making sure we paid off all of our high-cost debt to the extent we still had cash in excess of what we thought was the extremely high level that we like to keep, we did of course what we always do, which is return it to our shareholders, and that remains the commitment.","So, to the extent we have cash over and above what we believe the minimum is, having done all of those things, we'll continue return it to our shareholders. And we really \u2013 we try very hard to do it in an intelligent way. And there is no doubt that where the stock is today, it looks like a nice buying opportunity for American Airlines shareholders.","Operator","We'll go next to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R.

So, not to belabor this point up, but can you talk about at that target earnings level that you guys have put out there, like what kind of macro assumptions should we be assuming in the economy? And if we're assuming a stronger economy, shouldn't we also have baked in higher fuel prices, looking back when you set those targets?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? I'm sorry I missed it a little bit.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, I guess, what are you assuming underlying in the economy to hit your target earnings level? And shouldn't that also be associated with higher fuel prices? I mean, economic growth and higher energy costs kind of go hand-in-hand. Right?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Perhaps. Look, as we got \u2013 this may take a little longer than you wanted. Sorry. I got to separate the three, five, seven from like a near-term forecast versus what it really is.","So what we have said and continue to say and continue to believe is that we have an airline that has steady-state earnings potential and at the current size of about $5 billion pre-tax per year.","We believed that from about the time of the merger, it's been true in some years, not true in the last couple years that we made that or more. We continue to believe that's a good number. We believe in it so much that's how we set our annual incentive compensation for the executives of American Airlines.","So if we make $5 billion pre-tax, then we have target bonuses for the team. If it's less than that, we pay less. If it's below $3 billion, there's no bonus. If it's as high as $7 billion, it's a maximum bonus. Those are not \u2013 so they're not just statements we make. Those are \u2013 that's how we compensate ourselves because that's what we believe.","So then you ask \u2013 I think what you asked was, well, gee, why didn't your projections have higher fuel prices in it? We didn't go make that \u2013 we didn't go set that number based on projections of any given year. That's a \u2013 those are \u2013 that's a number again that we say should be true in kind of a steady-state year.","So I guess a better \u2013 I prefer to answer the question this way, which is, well, then why in 2018, a steady-state year, because you just gave us earnings guidance which is lower than that. What I would tell you is, it's because fuel price alone is driving $2 billion higher expenses in 2018 than it did in 2017, a year where we made $4 billion.","So that is what's driving us to not have 2018 currently forecast as one of those years. It's the increase in fuel prices year-over-year.","And I do believe, as I said at the outset, that we have an airline that can make $5 billion at $75 a barrel oil. That's not the issue. This is a short-term, a more near-term issue. It happening so fast and going up so quickly. So but if everything stayed at this level, we still believe we have an airline that will make $5 billion in steady-state times.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that. And then you guys laid out a lot of commercial initiatives at the Analyst Day last year. I mean, can you tell us where you're seeing the most traction right now across all the new product offering presentation?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","So, yeah, this is exciting for us because there's still so much to come, and we've really accomplished a lot. So Don and I have talked about where we stand with Basic Economy. We think that there's still more room to go there. We've obviously expanded recently into the Atlantic and Mexico and Caribbean.","But it's not quite as broad as we think it will be. Premium Economy is really just getting started. We now have, as I mentioned, 81 aircraft in \u2013 with Premium Economy seats, and offering it. So it's really getting started.","We won't be done with the fit-out of all of our aircraft until May of next year. But we'll have a sizable chunk out there and selling. And we're \u2013 and as we said, we're seeing great traction on that. And we're seeing fares that are basically double the main cabin fare, which is great.","I'll let Don talk a little bit more about revenue management initiatives that we've seen.","But then the other things that we laid out at Investor Day were along the lines of making sure our network is producing everything that it can. And we've made good progress, but we're probably only a quarter to a third of the way through, where we think that that will ultimately lead us.","You know about the investment that we've made with our sales team and making sure that we're really aggressive out in the marketplace. Good traction there but still really only just getting started. Frequent flyer programs and the work with our co-brand card, about half of the way through on that front, which is great progress.","And then we haven't even started yet on the seat harmonization work that we talked about. And that is putting new seats on our [Boeing] 737-300 \u2013 or [Boeing] 737-800 fleet and then also making sure that we have common cabin configurations throughout the rest of our fleet types. That has not even started.","And so we think that there is nearly $500 million of benefit that we'll see over the next few years as those installations progress. Don?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yeah. I'll finish that on the revenue management front. We made our first kind of major enhancement to our kind of coach cabin management system that we put in place in the middle of 2015. And we put that out of place late last year.","And just this month, we moved our premium cabin controls to bid-price controls. This is going to enable the system to make much better network decisions at the individual flight level.","As Robert mentioned, we had outlined $2.9 billion in revenue initiatives. Everything is on track, and people should really \u2013 I guess right at 60% of that benefit is going to improve in the \u2013 through 2019 to 2021.","Operator","We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks. I may have missed it in the commentary, but can you talk about what the implied domestic RASM is, if you see that positive in the second quarter?","And then as my follow-up, United rolled out Basic Economy I think in May of last year, pretty aggressively, and a bit earlier than you did. It felt like there was some share shift positively to you. Do you \u2013 can you quantify what that impact was in the second and third quarters?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure. So first of all, just in terms of domestic performance, and as we look forward into the second quarter, we still seal expect our domestic unit revenue to be positive as we look into the second quarter. This will be the seventh consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth. Basic Economy will be a part of that. We rolled that out in September, so we're continuing to get the benefit of that as we roll through the second and third quarters this year.","To be honest with you, we did not see any large impact related to United's rollout of Basic Economy. They did aggressively rolled up only at the fare ladder, when they rolled out in May. But by the time they got through the end of June, they had to have reverse that. And so we saw a little bit of benefit in the second quarter, very little in the third quarter, and so we don't see that as a material year-over-year impact. We just look at our own results.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hey. Just two here, one for Derek, the cancellation of the A350 order. Where does that show or where does that show up in your numbers or will it show up in things like equipment purchase deposits? Should we see any impact on the balance sheet?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No. You won't see any impact there. We can't talk about what we did to do that, but it's a very small portion. We had some PDPs that were out for that and we could use those for other things. So that's the \u2013 the biggest thing is no return of PDPs that we had.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just a second question to Robert. Robert, you brought this up, and maybe Don can help answer, but when you talked about strong or good close-in performance in the March quarter, I know you mentioned premium or corporate, but I think you also mentioned Basic Economy in the same sentence. Was that \u2013 so Basic Economy driving close-in, was that part of it, or did I not hear correctly?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yeah. This is Don. Yes, so our Basic Economy helps close-in revenue because many of our corporate customers are not buying Basic Economy, and they're buying up the higher fares where they were being able to buy at the Basic Economy level before we had the Basic Economy product. So part of our kind of strong year-over-year PRASM performance, again, when we get within 7 days departure of is related to the rollout of Basic Economy.","Operator","","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Operator, let's go to media.","Operator","We'll go to Leslie Josephs with CNBC.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey Leslie.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Hey. On the fuel costs, are \u2013 I see some carrier imposed charges already. Are fuel surcharges included in that? And do you see that expanding to other markets? I know you can't for domestic, but for some other ones?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We'll just have to see, I mean we're not going to comment on forward pricing.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Okay. Okay.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","It's going to have to \u2013 so we'll see what happens with...","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Okay. And then just on the Basic Economy, do you see that moving to other markets too and if so where?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Right now as you know, we've recently rolled out into the Atlantic, and we're going to see how it does there and we do think that there's opportunity elsewhere, and it will just take time to see.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Okay. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks Leslie.","Operator","Okay. We'll go next to John Biers with AFP Capital (sic) [Agence France-Presse] (57:26).","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We're back to the analysts. Hi.","John Biers - Agence France-Presse","Hi. Can you guys hear me?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, we can.","John Biers - Agence France-Presse","You can. Okay. Hi. It's John Biers with Agence France-Presse actually. My question is you guys talked a lot about higher fuel costs. I wondered we've been hearing some other company first of all do you expect ultimately at the end of the day that that will result in a high \u2013 if fuel prices stay high, that will result in overall higher fares by consumers maybe it's not tomorrow but in the coming months. That'd be my first question.","And then second, I would say, we've heard some other companies about, just in general about cost inflation on material. I'm wondering if you had encountered that in for example you're talking with aerospace companies about building the new claims. Is that something you're hearing a lot about in general or is inflation \u2013 do you think inflation in general or something else there?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yeah, okay. On the first one, oil is our second largest expense, a material amount of our total expenses. So when it increases, the cost of air travel increases. So I do believe that consumers will pay more not so much but they will in fact demand in a material way.","But that's what happens in most businesses as you're referencing. With your next question as the cost production goes up and indeed the cost of the product generally follows. So if indeed, this is where fuel prices against \u2013 I would expect you would see higher fares to consumers over time. On the second one Robert you go ahead.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. On the second one \u2013 yes, the answer is we're constantly engaged with aircraft manufacturers, engine manufacturers \u2013 all suppliers and partners to find new and better ways to work. And so whether that's aircraft design and work on fuel burn on aircraft, and reducing weight, and making things easier to maintain and service \u2013 those are all things that we work on all the time.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead.","Daniel E. Cravens - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tina, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. In the room with us today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Kirby, our President; Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer; and also in the room for the Q&A session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communication; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer and Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs.","As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter, and provide some color on our guidance for the fourth quarter. And Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions. And then lastly, questions from the media.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures included this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us this morning. And at this point, we'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Excellent. Thank you, Dan, and thanks, everybody, for being on here. We this morning reported the highest quarterly profit in American Airlines' long proud history, $1.9 billion excluding net charges for the quarter. Obviously, very pleased with these results. Particularly proud of the fact that over the last six or seven days, our team has migrated all of our reservations on to one system, something that is a key milestone for our customers and the fact that we now have one \u2013 we are now selling under one brand, but a really key milestone for our team.","This is an issue that other airlines have stumbled at in the past in their migration. Our team did it flawlessly. This was by far the largest and most complex, one of these integration initiatives, that it had to take place. So we couldn't be happier. This is further evidence of what this team is doing to build the greatest airline in the world. Maya Leibman is here as is Robert Isom, the two people whose teams had the most to do with this. They'd be the first to tell you it wasn't them, however, but their teams. So, I just want to use this opportunity to thank everyone that was involved in this project and the entire 100,000 people of American Airlines who are working to build the greatest airline in the world, and they're showing everyday that we are well on our way to do that.","The result of all that, the financial results, the phenomenal integration work, everything else was going on including great operations the team are now running are evidence of the fact that we are well on our way to building the greatest airline in the world. We know we have a lot of work to do, but we are very bullish on our future. That bullishness is evidenced in the fact that we repurchased $1.56 billion of common stock in the quarter, 38.4 million shares. And we're happy to return that value to our shareholders through share repurchases because we think that's the right thing to do.","As we generate profits, the first thing we do is make sure we invest it in the airline. We are doing that, producing very nice returns with that capital, making sure we reduce the debt at the same time but then to the extent there's cash left over. And certainly, at a time when we think the market isn't recognizing the value we produce, we use it to repurchase shares. So that's what happened this quarter. Those are the highlights.","I will turn it over now to Derek who will give you a lot more detail followed by Scott. Thanks.","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. As Doug said, we filed our third quarter 2015 10-Q along with our earnings press release this morning. And in that earnings release, we reported the highest quarterly profit in the company's history, beating the previous record set just last quarter.","Excluding net special charges, our third quarter net profit was $1.9 billion or $2.77 per diluted share. This represents a $662 million improvement versus our third quarter 2014 net profit, excluding net special charges of $1.2 billion, or $1.77 per diluted share.","Third quarter 2015 pre-tax margin, excluding net special charges, was a record 17.7%, up 6.7 points year-over-year. We currently have the youngest fleet of any in the U.S. network airlines. In the third quarter of 2015, we took delivery of 16 new mainline aircraft and retired 36 mainline aircraft older at 75s, 76s and MD-80s.","On the regional sub, we took delivery of 15 aircraft and we removed from service and parked 9 aircraft. We also continue to modernize our fleet. Over the next several years, our fleet will get even younger and the differential in fleet age will continue to expand relative to our network peers.","The total capacity for the third quarter of 2015 was 71.1 billion ASMs, up 2.9% from the same period in 2014. Mainline capacity for the quarter was 63.5 billion ASMs, up 2.6%. Regional capacity for the quarter was up 5% to 7.63 billion ASMs due primarily to larger gauge aircraft and longer stage-length flying.","Our third quarter 2015 revenue was negatively impacted by large capacity increases in certain domestic segments, as well as weaker yields in international markets due principally to foreign currency devaluation, lower fuel surcharges and continued economic softness in Latin America.","For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.7 billion, down 3.9% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9.4 billion, down 4.2%, driven by yields 9.2% lower on a 2.9% increase in system capacity.","Cargo revenues were down 16.3% to $180 million due primarily to lower yields and other revenue. Operating revenues were $1.2 billion, up 0.6%.","Total RASM in the third quarter of 2015 was $0.1506, down 6.6%, driven principally by the decline in passenger RASM, which was $0.1316 down 6.8%, and Scott will give a little bit more detail after my remarks.","The Airline's operating expenses excluding net special changes for the third quarter of 2015 were $8.5 billion, down 11.5% year-over-year primarily due to a 43.5% decrease in consolidated fuel expense. As we have seen now for the first nine months of 2015, our financial results reflect the material benefit from the significant year-over-year drop in crude oil prices as we remain unhedged.","Our average mainline fuel price including taxes for the third quarter of 2015 was $1.67 per gallon, a 43.8% decline versus $2.97 per gallon last year. Lower fuel prices drove a 14.3% decline in mainline operating cost per ASM excluding net special charges to $0.1107. Excluding net special charges and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0856 in the third quarter of 2015, up 2.6%.","This increase is due primarily to higher salaries and benefits, costs associated with our new labor contracts that were signed at the beginning of this year. These wage increases increased our third quarter mainline CASM, excluding special charges and fuel, by approximately 3.4 percentage points.","Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding net special charges and fuel, was $0.1578 for the third quarter, an increase of 1.7%. Excluding net special charges and fuel, our consolidated third quarter 2015 CASM was up 2.6%, principally due to increased flying under our capacity purchase agreements.","We ended the third quarter with $9.6 billion in total cash and investments. Of this, $710 million was restricted and $609 million was held in Venezuela bolivars. We currently have $1.8 billion of revolving credit capacity, none of which has been drawn, which we consider to be one of the least expensive forms of liquidity on our capital structure. We have been working to upsize our existing revolving credit capacity by approximately $600 million and expect to accomplish that by the end of this month.","Attractive debt markets have allowed us to complete new financings at favorable rates. In the third quarter, the company issued $1.1 billion in enhanced equipment trust certificates at a blended rate of 3.8%. In addition, the company re-marketed $365 million of the New York JFK Airport Special Facility Revenue Bonds at a one-year rate of 2%. We also raised another $845 million of aircraft financings in the private debt market.","During the third quarter of 2015, we generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and paid down $714 million in debt. The company returned $1.63 billion to its shareholders through the payment of $67 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.56 billion of common stock, or 38.4 million shares at an average price of $40.56 per share.","In the first nine months of 2015, the company has returned approximately $2.7 billion to its shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. And since the merger closed, we have reduced the company's shares outstanding by approximately 100 million shares or 14% through share repurchases and share withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations on employee share issuances.","As our program to return capital to shareholders continues, we recognize the need to be prudent about our leverage. We closely watch our minimum cash levels and routinely stress test our credit metrics. As we have said before, our minimum cash will continue to be higher than our competitors', but lower than it is today.","Now that our passenger service system integration is complete, we will reevaluate our leverage and minimum cash levels. When complete, we will communicate guidelines that clarify our strategy going forward.","At our board of directors' meeting held yesterday, the board authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase program to be completed by December 31, 2016. This brings the total amount of share repurchase program authorized in 2015 to $6 billion. The company's board of directors has also declared a $0.10 per share dividend to be paid on November 19, 2015 to shareholders of record as of November 5, 2015.","Turning now to our guidance, we are forecasting overall system capacity growth to be up approximately 1%, resulting in full-year domestic capacity growth of approximately 1% to 2% in 2015, while international capacity is expected to be flat to up 1%.","For the fourth quarter 2015, mainline capacity and ASM is expected to be 58.3 billion and regional capacity is expected to be 7.37 billion in the fourth quarter. We're still in the process of developing our 2016 operating plan. So, as usual, the formal ASM guidance for 2016 will come when we report fourth quarter 2014 earnings.","At this time, we expect year-over-year system capacity to be up approximately 2% to 3% in 2016. Approximately one point of the increase is due to our growth of the Pacific entity, while another point is due to leap year and aircraft reconfigurations that increased the gauge of our aircraft.","Domestic capacity is expected to be up approximately 1% to 2%, while international capacity is expected to be up approximately 4% to 6%. For the full-year 2015, we are forecasting year-over-year total CASM ex special items and fuel to be up approximately 3% to 5%. As we have seen throughout this year, this increase is driven primarily by labor contracts covering our pilots and flight attendants and investment we have made to improve the reliability of our operation.","Mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel is projected to be up approximately 4% to 6%, while regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel is projected to be approximately flat to up 2%.","As I mentioned in my earlier comments, we continue to see a substantial financial benefit as a result of low fuel prices. Using the October 21 forward curve, we are forecasting our 2015 consolidated fuel price to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75 per gallon.","Based on these prices, we expect our 2015 consolidated fuel expense to improve by approximately $5 billion year-over-year. Our fourth quarter forecast is between $1.48 and $1.53 per gallon for mainline, and regional $1.51 to $1.56.","Using the midpoints of the guidance we have provided along with PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect to continue our string of strong margin performance with the fourth quarter pre-tax margin, excluding special items, of between 12% and 14%.","As we conclude 2015 and complete our plans for 2016, we will continue to focus on completing our remaining integration items, investing in the airline by renewing our fleet, improving our operational performance and returning excess cash to our shareholders.","In terms of capital expenditures, we expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $5.3 billion in 2015, of which approximately $1.3 billion will occur in the fourth quarter. In addition, for the full-year 2015, we expect to invest $900 million in non-aircraft CapEx, which includes many investments to improve our product. And we also expect to make $2.2 billion in debt payments.","In conclusion, I'd also like to thank and congratulate our more than 100,000 team members for again producing the highest quarterly profits in the company's history. We knew that 2015 was going to be a big year for integration. And given the results achieved thus far, our team has performed exceptionally well. So, thanks again for your time this morning, and I'll turn it over to Scott.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start by also adding my thanks to all the people at American Airlines for the truly fantastic job that they've been doing operationally and for the great work that everyone did to make the cut over to a new reservation system. That's a success that was largely seamless for our customers.","As most of you know, moving to single res system is probably the biggest technical training system and process hurdle that airlines face after a merger and our teams led by Maya Leibman, our CIO, and Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer, just did a fantastic job.","In fact, in the first day, five days since the cut-over happened, we've run an 89.4% on-time performance and a 99.95% completion factor. So while we're proud of the job the team did on the cut-over, we're also quite proud of the strong operational result that American Airlines is producing prior to cut-over and continued producing since then.","Our system on-time arrival rate and completion factor in September and October are the best that we have in our records which go back to 2000. At our largest hub, DFW, we've made significant strides in running a reliable operation since we rebanked the hub, including a 10-point improvement in our departures within zero minute of scheduled time, a 9-point improvement on time performance, and a 99.9% completion factor. So, a big thanks to the team at DFW for the great results.","I could go on and on, but I'll just close this section by saying thanks to all the people of American Airlines who've done such a great job in completing the reservation systems cut-over. At the same time, they're running a fantastic operation.","On the revenue front, our third quarter PRASM was down 6.8%. Domestically, PRASM was down 7.6%. And we saw the strongest performance in New York and Charlotte and the weakest performance in hubs that have a greater share of international connecting traffic into the domestic system.","Internationally, the stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges made up 2.7 points of our total system PRASM decline, but we saw additional weakness beyond currencies in Asia and Latin America. The Atlantic was our strongest region where PRASM was down 5.6%, and this decline was mostly explained by the stronger U.S. dollar.","Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 11.3% with weakness in both Japan and China, the flat year-over-year PRASM in South Korea and Hong Kong. LatAm PRASM was down 10.4%, but as has been for a while now, that weakness is concentrated in Brazil and Venezuela where PRASM was down 25% and 46%, respectively.","Looking forward, we expect the fourth quarter to look similar to the third quarter with the same factors that drove the decline in Q3 continuing into Q4. We project the currency and surcharge declines will impact system PRASM by 2.1 points in Q4, which is down from 2.7 points in Q3 as we're beginning to overlap the time when the dollar started strengthening last year.","We continue to see significant year-over-year competitive growth in Dallas as Southwest completed their final expansion at Love Field. And in South America, we don't see any improvement yet on the horizon. The revenue environment doesn't seem to have gotten any worse, but there aren't yet any signs of improvement. We don't realistically expect any improvement in South America until the Brazilian economy turns around. Given all that, we expect our system PRASM to decline 5% to 7% year-over-year in 4Q.","In conclusion, we passed a significant milestone in the integration this quarter. We're very proud of the job that the entire team at American Airlines has done in getting the res system integrated and beginning to produce record operational results.","There's still a lot of hard work left to do to finish the integration of the remaining systems and processes. But passing this milestone is a huge achievement and lets us begin or turn our energies, time and resources to innovating and continuing to make American Airlines a better airline for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott. And then I have one last thing for you. The question just \u2013 it turns out today is a big day in commercial aviation history, which people may not know. It's Scott's 20-year anniversary with our company today. October 23, 1995, Scott Kirby joined America West Airlines as Senior Director of Scheduling & Planning.","So anyway, I had joined America West like five months before that, so I've been working with Scott now for 20 years and he's a young guy. He's got 20 years left, but I'll just use this opportunity to point out. Anyway, we're happy he joined 20 years ago. He's the best in the business. He's a driver of change and has been a driver of change in a business that's needed it dearly. And we wouldn't be here without him. The result is that people of America West, U.S. Airways and American Airlines are all in much better shape than they would have been had Scott chosen to do something else 20 years ago. So we're glad he did. Thanks, Scott. Congratulations.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Thank you. It's embarrassing, but thank you.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I know. That was the point. All right. Operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the time. I guess, the first question just on the capacity guide for next year. It seems like it would be growing a bit more versus 2015, but the economy doesn't seem to be picking up and GDP isn't looking great. So just some more color on the thinking there.","J. Scott Kirby - President","As Derek said, it's really driven by two things: One is adding service into Australia, which is a big chunk of it. And the other one is gauge on aircraft. And we are behind \u2013 we intended to have more aircraft regauged for 2015 to 2016 and 2015. And one of our seat manufacturers got way behind on producing seat, and so some of that slipped. And so up-gauging that we originally expected to occur in 2015 is now going to occur in 2016 or is going to occur for 2016. That's really what's driving it as opposed to the macroeconomic. It's really just a delay in getting the gauge changed on some of the aircraft.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then just switching gears, On buybacks, you guys were clearly aggressive this past quarter. I guess, I'd just like to get more color on how you think about it just quarter-to-quarter, how do you arrive at the right level just to help us figure out how to think about it over time?","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Look, this is Doug, I'll start. Again, as we told you in the last quarter, we look particularly in times when it feels \u2013 we do not do this on a systematic basis as some companies I know do. We came into the merger with more cash than certainly our peers and arguably excess cash. We, however, knew we needed to get through a complex integration and, therefore, wanted to hold a good bit of cash to make sure that we were confident that all is going well. We clearly have passed that threshold.","At this point, what we do is as the company can use it to earn cash and produce cash, we first invest in the business. We are doing that on a pretty large scale and doing so in a way our investors would be proud because we're producing nice returns on what we are investing your capital in. Having done that, we look to pay down any high cost debt. We have done that and now are actually borrowing at rates that we simply can't ignore and believe are rates that we should borrow at. On aircraft, for example, I think, as Derek noted, we closed the EETC this past quarter at $1 billion at something around 3.8%.","So we don't think it makes sense to use our cash to purchase the airplanes but rather that we should borrow it at those rates because we could produce higher returns for you at those rates \u2013 than those rates. That leaves us with cash on hand that still is in excess of what we need. And we don't think the right thing to do with it for you is to leave it in our bank account but rather to return it to you. And we try to do that really efficiently.","So what that means is, in times like last quarter when we went through and we may go again, and there are people wondering if the industry has changed or not and such things and whether or not these type of results can continue, and our view may be different than the market. We like to use those opportunities to purchase our shares at levels that are less than we believe they were. So you put all that together and you get to numbers like this.","Therefore, it's really hard to tell you what it's going to be like in the future because it's not systemic. It's based on what we have left to do \u2013 what we have in excess remaining and what we feel about the relative value at the time. So a really long way of me telling you it's going to be maybe perhaps hard for you to project in the future, but I can tell you this. We're committed to returning value to our shareholders. And to the extent we have excess cash and to the extent we believe the market isn't giving us full value for what we plan to do, we'll repurchase shares.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","We'll go to Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a successful reservation system cutover.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Thanks, Julie.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Now that that's complete, what's the biggest focus from an operational standpoint, and are there levers that the system combination alone unlocks or do you still need to get the flight operating system combination and the seniority list integration?","J. Scott Kirby - President","Well, when you say operations, I'm going to take it more broadly. It is great to have this milestone behind us. The team, as we've all said, just did a fantastic job on getting it done, and that's really the foundation that lets us start doing a whole backlog of projects and things that we want to do, specifically on the operations front.","Robert and his team are already off and running and the numbers of late are quite strong, but under improving our core reliability, innovating on more customer self-service options, a whole suite of things that we haven't been able to get done because all of those resources were working on the systems integration to make it easier for customers to deal with us, either for our employees to have the information that they need and the tools that they need to provide a great service to our customers.","On the commercial side, we have a huge backlog of projects in terms of all kinds of areas, but two bigger areas are the frequent flyer program and doing more innovation within the frequent flyer program. And secondly, doing more to further disaggregate the products and really move to a world where we can offer fares that compete with low-cost carriers and have a suite of attributes that are appropriate for those prices, and then fares that have a greater suite of attributes and give our customers choice. It's all about giving our customers choice.","And so there really are just hundreds of projects. I hope that the IT team took a few days to rest and recover because we want them and are hoping that they're going to be running just as hard as they have for the last two years on the big backlog of stuff that we have left to go.","We're also glad to \u2013 well, we got two of our big labor contracts done. Another big thing is finishing the remaining labor contracts as those groups have gotten through the NMB process and had certification for their bargaining unit. Our customer service workers have a contract \u2013 a tentative agreement that's in place right now. We look forward to having that one behind us, and then the remaining workgroups we're in negotiating with all of them and I hope to have deals done with them soon.","So it really is a great milestone for us to accomplish and to be able to look forward to moving forward really on all fronts of the business.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. And then maybe a quick one for Derek. I know it's a little early to talk about 2016 non-fuel unit cost. But in light of the capacity guidance that you gave today, is there any directional color you can offer?","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think ex any of the labor deals, because we don't know where those are going to come out. I would expect right around flat to 2% range from CASM ex-fuel next year. But that would exclude any new labor deals that would be put into place.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Thanks, Julie.","Operator","We'll go to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Hey, Jamie.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Doug, I think it's only appropriate that you dedicate Mariah Carey's hit single Fantasy to Scott as it was the Billboard number one on this day back in 2005.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, thank you for that fine research.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. No doubt on...","J. Scott Kirby - President","You're very good with the Google.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No doubt, it was on Scott's Walkman at the time.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jamie.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Scott, a question. You're guiding in the fourth quarter to somewhere around $1 billion of year-on-year fuel savings, probably a little bit more than that. But the margin guidance implies an EBIT improvement of around $150 million or so. Maybe it's $200 million. We'll digest the full 8-K in a little bit.","In a simplistic measure, this implies that the vast majority of your fuel savings are not being retained, that you're only hanging on to somewhere around 15% of the benefit, maybe 20% of the benefit. Delta and United also guided for the fourth quarter. They think they are going to hang on to about half of their fuel benefit. Indeed, that's what you retained in this third quarter. So what is it about Q4 that's making you slip and slip relative to the third quarter and causing you to underperform the competition?","J. Scott Kirby - President","So thanks for the question, Jamie. And...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","J. Scott Kirby - President","...as I think you know, it's a little bit of a simplistic analysis when you just try to tie fuel savings to what's falling straight to bottom line because it's ignoring everything else that is happening. But it's a fair point for you to make, although it really comes down to the relationship of RASM to fuel price and what's happening with relative RASM performance. And on that front, our relative RASM we're forecasting is going to be down compared to what Delta and United have in the fourth quarter. One of the reasons for that, of course, is credit card deals. All three of our big major competitors have credit card deals on a year-over-year basis that have RASM flowing through to the bottom line. We don't have a new credit card deal.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good point.","J. Scott Kirby - President","And the other ones, or probably the two big ones at least, are Brazil and Love Field, which are disproportionately affecting us. One other point I'd make, it doesn't matter from the sequential third quarter to fourth quarter. But on a year-over-year basis, we did sign the new five-year labor contracts with pilots and flight attendants. Again, something that's impacting us, but it impacts the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter.","All that said, we feel really excited that we're now through the integration. It's hard to pinpoint a number and it's hard to tell you exactly what is going to change. But the reality is that we had a lot of constraints embedded in the revenue management systems and our distribution systems. A lot of things \u2013 and even just resource constraints of people spending eight hours a day working on the res system integration and then trying to do their day job after they finished all their work on res system integration.","So I can't put specific numbers on it, but I feel pretty optimistic that we've been held back a little bit. We've done it to ourselves, as we focus really on having a successful reservation systems integration. And now being able to turn our full attention in those groups to optimizing revenue, I believe, will lead to relative outperformance.","Now, we still are going to have the kind of headwinds of credit card deal in Brazil and Love Field to deal with. But at least relative to where we are right now, I certainly hope that we are going to start outperforming even more.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. A very thorough response. I appreciate that. Quick follow-up. I am trying to assess how the impact of low-cost carriers in your hubs differs from how revenue is holding up in markets, O&Ds where discounters don't publish fares? How would you compare the overall revenue dynamic in each type of those two markets? Is it your view that we're also seeing too much pricing aggression, particularly close in, in those markets where discounters are not a factor?","J. Scott Kirby - President","So revenue performance in markets where low cost or ultra low cost carriers are growing are clearly performing worse than in markets that don't have that. But a similar story is true in markets if there's a lot of legacy carrier ASM growth, we also have lower RASM performance. Of course, the low-cost carriers have been growing more, so there's more markets that are subject to that.","There has, however, I think \u2013 this is a trend that's been going on for 15 years at least. As there are more and more markets that have low-cost carriers flying in them, there are just more and more markets that are impacted even beyond that. So we have thousands of markets that we consider drive markets, Greensboro, North Carolina, that the pricing in Greensboro, even though it doesn't have low-cost carrier service, is impacted by Raleigh-Durham, which the airports are, I think, 55 miles apart. The customers have indicated willingness to drive.","So I think that the vast majority of pricing, probably north of 85% of domestic pricing, is really either directly or indirectly influenced by low-cost carrier pricing, which means as they're growing, it's affecting not just the 2% or 3% of revenue in markets that they're in, but it's affecting a much \u2013 it does affect a much bigger piece of the pie.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the clarity. Appreciate it, gentlemen.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jamie.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","We'll go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. So a little bit of a follow-up on Jamie's question and I kind of want to \u2013 I'd love you to synthesize some of the stuff you've been alluding to throughout your prepared remarks. Obviously, you want to talk about this, I can tell, about some of the IT stuff. So...","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How could you possibly tell that?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Love to do that. So okay, it's clear that you guys have concluded that ULCCs are a long-term threat in your market and they need to be dealt with and fine. That's your decision to make. But how do we know that you guys aren't totally blowing up yourself in the process of defending them, causing long-term damage on the pricing side while you're doing what you think you need to do to match them on fares.","So effectively, what you've done is \u2013 feel free to disagree with the premise, but you're competing against yourself. You're selling $41 walk-up fares to business travelers that were never going to be in the ULCC to begin with. So is there a more tactical way to going about keeping the pressure on the ULCCs as vis-\u00e0-vis they're competing in your market while being a little bit more surgical about how you don't impact your own close-in demands by like inverting the yield curve for \u2013 inverting the booking curve, I mean, for example, and then that in itself might be an IT question.","J. Scott Kirby - President","It's not an IT question, but thank you for the question, Hunter. And I don't agree with all the premises of at least you representing our view in the question.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Tell me where I'm wrong, actually, if you would.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Well, more broadly, I'll talk about because I get this question a lot. I do get this question a lot from investors about \u2013 I would summarize it as, why are you matching ultra low cost carriers' price. And for what it's worth, we're doing \u2013 to start, we're doing what's best for American Airlines and for American Airlines shareholders, for our customers, and that's the premise that we do every day from. I have started asking investors when they ask me that question, if they own shares of Spirit Airlines, and so far, 100% of them have been honest enough to acknowledge that yes, they do.","And so we're not trying to do things that helps Spirit. We're trying to do things that are better for American Airlines. This, however, is not something that's just about Spirit. Most people ask it about in that context because they happen to own shares in Spirit. But we're competing the same against Frontier and Volaris and Norwegian Air Shuttle and carriers around the world.","Essentially what we're doing is anytime that we are competing with a nonstop carrier, nonstop-to-nonstop, we're going to compete and match their prices. And the reason is because those carriers are relevant, and we have many customers who are willing to fly them. A statistic that when I told people they find somewhat amazing is that 87% of the people that have flown American Airlines in the last year flew us only one time. So 87% of our unique customers fly us one time for a year or less, and they represent over 50% of our revenue.","While there are a lot of our customers who want to have a lie-flat seat to fly in the transcon market or who want a lie-flat seat to fly when they go overseas and are willing to pay a premium for a better product. We have that 50% of customers who are very infrequent travelers who fly us once per year \u2013 50% of our revenue who fly us once per year or less, for whom air travel is largely a commodity, and I wish it wasn't that way, but it is. And you can see it. I'll give you some more stats in a minute about how much Spirit and Frontier and others have grown and how successful they can be in getting those customers to move off of us if we don't match their prices. And so, 50% of our customers are up for grabs. We have to compete for them. We can't just walk away from that size of the business.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","50% of revenue?","J. Scott Kirby - President","50% of revenue, sorry. And if you look at what's happened, it gives you some clarity on how those customers have moved to low-cost carriers. In Dallas, for example, before American filed bankruptcy, Spirit served three markets out of Dallas. Today, they serve \u2013 they have over 50 flights a day in 25 markets. In Chicago, they've grown to 24 markets with over 60 flights per day. In Dallas, Spirit at DFW is our number two competitor. They are larger than either Delta or United. In Chicago, they're the number three competitor. They're larger than Delta in Chicago. In those 25 routes in Dallas that Spirit flies, they have 20% market share, huge market share. But you have to understand this, when Spirit flies a flight, they carry all local passengers. So one Spirit flight is the equivalent of about three American Airlines flights, because we carry so many connecting flights. So if they fly a market twice a day, that's the equivalent of American Airlines flying six times a day in terms of the amount of passengers that they carry.","Also, we have larger overlap. If you measure our overlap as our domestic ASMs that have non-stop competition from someone, 28% of our domestic ASMs have non-stop competition with Spirit. That is much larger than our domestic overlap with Delta and United.","Frontier, similar. Frontier, before American filed bankruptcy, had 1% overlap with the American Airlines networks, and they've grown that by 1000% and they now have 11% overlap. Similar statistics, they're not as large because of the markets, but in some of the international markets where Volaris has grown into many markets.","And so given that 50% of our revenue is up for grabs in these markets and that these carriers have had so much success when they weren't matched, we know that we have to match their fares. This isn't something that's unique to ultra-low-cost carriers. We match Delta. We match United. We match Air France. We match every carrier that we compete with around the globe. But if we are going to fly head to head and compete non-stop to non-stop with any carrier around the globe, we are going to be competitive and match their prices.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So that's all well and good. And this is my last question, it's a true follow-up, but is there a way \u2013 what we don't know as an investment community is how many seats you're selling on a plane to match that. Are you selling three seats? Are you selling a row?","J. Scott Kirby - President","Yeah.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Or are you selling 25% of your seats? And that's what some of your competitors I think do better and that's maybe where you haven't had the resources from an IT perspective to get more surgical on your inventory. So I'm not saying you should come in here and let ULCCs take your share or whatever, but is there a way to be more precise? And to have a certain product that's more tailored to that type of customer, so you're not imploding, like I said, the booking curves. So, I, the business traveler, I'm buying the $46 walk-up.","J. Scott Kirby - President","So thanks for the follow-up because there are good points that I didn't make. One, so we are trying to be precise about where we have seats available. And what we've seen so far, and I'm sure we can fine tune it, but we're pretty happy with our results so far, in markets where we've matched ultra-low-cost carriers, our RASM performance has been the same as it has been in the rest of our domestic system. So we've performed just as well. What we've done is we're running much higher load factors, particularly on formerly off-peak flights. We've done a really good job so far of directing that traffic to formerly off-peak flights running higher load factors, running lower yields.","But our RASM performance even in the short-term has been equivalent to the RASM performance we've had in the rest of the system. And there probably are opportunities to fine-tune it, but that's normal course of business stuff that we do, and it's not going to be a meaningful change in terms of the number of seats.","One thing longer term that we would like to do, I talked earlier about further disaggregating the product is, and we haven't been able to do this yet because we've been getting through integration, but we are going to go to a product that has different attributes. And so that the attributes that you get if you buy ultra-low cost carrier competitive fare are going to be different. I'm not going to give you all of the attributes that will be different today because we'll wait till we're ready to announce it. But that's something that we hope to have in place in 2016, which will have two benefits for us. One, it will allow us to compete with the ultra-low-cost carriers.","And for that 50% of revenue and 87% of the customers that are up for grabs, it will allow us to offer them a product that's competitive on price with ultra-low-cost carriers. But also, for our customers that want a better product and our frequent flyers that want better seats on the airplane, we can give them the choice of not paying that fare and getting a better product.","But we're not going to have that in place until sometime in 2016. And in the interim, we can't just walk away from competing with Delta or United or Air France of WestJet or Frontier, any of those carriers. And so, we're going to keep competing and knowing that we have upside later to come sometime in 2016.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Great, Scott. Thank you very much.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","We've got Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Helane.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, John and thanks for the \u2013 and Maya, thanks for the time. So I noticed that you announced that you're going back into Venezuela, I think, from New York. And I'm just kind of wondering, is that market showing signs of improvement that you would go back into that market.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Well, it's still profitable, but it's not improving. But it's enough that we thought it was \u2013 that it would be incrementally profitable to serve New York, even though RASM is down 46%. It's still a profitable market, however.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one point of clarification on your response to Hunter, the 80-some-odd percent of your passengers that are unique, is that system wide?","J. Scott Kirby - President","It is. It was 87%.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, so 87%, okay. So if you looked at like Dallas for something like that, are the numbers lower where you could be more \u2013 because one of your strengths actually, I think, Scott, it was you who developed that whole plan when you were at America West, that closed your lowest buckets sooner rather than later. And at America West, you guys were outperforming the industry in terms of RASM and yield well before the rest of the industry kind of caught on to what you were doing. And I'm just kind of wondering why you wouldn't be that clever in your current role.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Well, I think we are that clever. And look, we're doing the exact same kind of stuff. The big thing that we did that I think you're referencing at America West was we stopped matching connecting fares that were really low. So the example I used to use with Wall Street was I looked at a pricing display and saw Orlando to Seattle for $79 in the summer. And I looked out at our August \u2013 or our July FPS from the previous year and we had run at 96% load factor between Orlando and Phoenix and a 97% load factor between Phoenix and Seattle. And so why would we ever want to sell a $79 fare between Orlando and Seattle?","So that's where it started. But we've never done that in our non-stop market. It's one of the great things about running a hub-and-spoke airline is you can be willing to not be price-competitive in a connecting market that doesn't make sense for you and pick the connecting markets where fares are okay and continue to be competitive in the local markets. But you can't walk away from competition in a local market because it's too important to \u2013 it's always the largest segment of O&D traffic flows in the market.","And secondly, you walk away from a long-term relationship with the customer to be in the AAdvantage program, even people that are flying once a day right now, getting them on American experiencing our fantastic product, experiencing the new aircraft that we have, because someday that might be a customer that's an Executive Platinum customer. And so we're not going to ever walk away in the local market, though we are willing to walk away in connecting markets.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Yeah?","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Helane. It's Doug, how are you?","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, look, only because Scott's going to get angry eventually if people keep suggesting we don't know what we're doing.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sorry, I don't want to do that.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, no. Helane, you were very kind about it, but let me just try and \u2013 let me just from my perspective tell you that what I think Scott said in detail was at a global level. The 20 years of experience Scott brings is going into this analysis as well, and we are not constrained by systems, we are not constrained by intellect. And indeed, we know what we're doing and we're extremely comfortable with what we're doing. We have to be careful when we talk about pricing in the future, but we're perfectly comfortable telling you that the same people that have gotten us this far who are the best pricing yield management people in the business are managing pricing yield management in American right now and are not constrained by systems and have not suddenly changed the way they look at analyses.","But the reality is all the things Scott said, which are this is non-stop service, we will and need to compete on price on non-stop service. So to the extent any of our competitors are suggesting that maybe we had \u2013 that we've lost sight of this, they're incorrect. And you guys know enough to know that so long as we're focused on it, we're going to be doing it better than anybody else and we are. So, you guys can keep asking these questions, but we really know what we're doing, and Scott and his team know what they're doing, and we are going to continue doing what we're doing.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Well, that's awesome and...","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","...that's good that you continue to do what you're doing because, obviously, it's been very successful. So, thanks very much for all that clarification. I appreciate that.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","We'll go to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks very much for taking the questions, guys. Listen, I just wanted to check, everybody looks at this business, sort of this industry, on a CASM basis. But if I just take a step back, by our math, your mainline cost per passenger is in the $180 range in the third quarter, and that's with really cheap fuel. Do you think that's a fair assessment?","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I haven't done the math. I don't know.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. I think it's in that range. And in that vein, with respect to some of this walk-up fare pricing that we're seeing, I guess the decision is we're just going to lose money until something changes. So, I guess, how are you measuring the success of this very aggressive walk-up fare program that we're really not seeing from other airlines here in the U.S.? How will we measure the success of it?","J. Scott Kirby - President","Duane, we are not deciding to lose money. We aren't losing money. And I suspect that your Econ 101 class they taught you that you don't sell everything at the average cost. We sell a lot of tickets below our average cost because they are quite profitable on the airline. It all adds up to a profitability. But our variable costs are not the same as our average cost.","And as the statistics already gave you, in these markets, once we've gone to matching their prices, we've actually had performance that's been either in line or better than the rest of the system. And so we feel really good about it. Every single market that we are matching any low cost carrier is profitable. They're nicely profitable. They're some of the most profitable markets in our system. And you can see that that adds up to 17% plus margins in this quarter. So it's working really well.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Appreciate that commentary, and certainly don't want to beat a dead horse here, but it seems like a very favorable environment right now with fuel as low as it is. And I guess the question would be and it's one you can't comment on because it speaks to the future, but the question is how quickly can you get that pricing back? And are you diluting your brand with some of this pricing?","J. Scott Kirby - President","So the question on fuel actually, I think if fuel prices went up, our ability to compete is improved because fuel as a percentage of cost is much bigger for low-cost carriers. And so their average cost advantage declined as fuel price goes up. So our ability to compete gets better in a higher fuel price environment.","And as to the longer term question, I tried to answer it once before, but we will do more to disaggregate the product and really have a product that has less frills, comes with a really cheap price, and we're going to do more to have products for the brand for that. Less than half of customers who fly us more than once \u2013 or that less than half of revenue from customers who are more frequent travelers who want the premium product and who want to pay for the brand, and who want a better experience, we're going to be able to give them the choice of having that, but it will be sometime in 2016 before we can do that.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then, just lastly by our math and I wondered if you agree, if I just look at ASMs Dallas metro, I see you guys at 70% of domestic and Southwest at about 16% and Spirit at about 4%, and Spirit is not really growing right now. So, I guess the question is, if they're not growing, Southwest is growing a lot, I guess, I would just question again what the long-term game plan is here. And again, thank you for taking the questions.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Our long-term game plan is to compete with every airline that flies that we need to compete with, which includes every airline that we are competing head-to-head nonstop with, is the long-term plan. And, as to the Spirit 4% point, it's a bad statistic, because included in your statistic is the amount of customers that are flying from Dallas to Abilene, a market that Spirit is not in. The relevant statistic is the 25 markets that Spirit flies, they have 20% market share, and any other statistic is irrelevant.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott. And then, Duane, you didn't specifically ask us, but your comments about fuel prices being so low give me the opportunity to make a comment, to make some points I've wanted to make. I referenced in my opening comments about how \u2013 we, on the last call, went through the points about whether the industry is indeed different. So, I want to point out this on fuel. The reality is, Brent oil prices this year are going to average to something around $55 a barrel. In 2005, Brent averaged $55 a barrel. The economic cycle for 2005, and you guys decide, but it was a pretty good year in the economic cycle.","So the two things that we as airlines that really affect our profitability that are outside our control, the economic cycle and fuel prices, were very similar in 2005 as they are in 2015. In 2005, this industry lost $28 billion. In 2015, we're going to make something close to $20 billion. This business is not the same. It's dramatically different. People that are worried that, oh, my gosh, now that fuel prices have fallen, here go fares falling and what are the airlines going to do, it's the old business again, are missing the point and are missing what has happened.","This business has dramatically transformed. Fuel prices fall, indeed. It does make sense for some capacity to come in that does result in prices falling. But if you think this is the old business, you're just not paying attention. And I know you didn't say it, Duane, so I'm not saying that to you directly. But anyone that suggests that just isn't paying attention. Just go look at what's happened over 10 years and what's happened over 10 years is there have been five big mergers. And as a result, we got a business now that's still intensely competitive, but actually can produce returns for investors and we're doing that. So, anyway, that was just a gratuitous commentary from me. Thanks.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much for the time.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","We'll go to Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, just a question here and I guess, Scott, you're getting a workout here. I apologize. But look, now that you're a single airline from a distribution and marketing perspective, I mean, some of the opportunities, but I wanted to ask you about some of the opportunities, but sort of within the context of just some of the recent news I saw that Sabre now is going to be using this new distribution capability to sort of connect right into some of your ancillary product. And one of the things that I actually felt was interesting, I didn't realize that your agency point of sale that that was at \u2013 that the Direct Connect was 15%, or that represented 15%, which sounds like that that's right up there with some of your GDS volumes from agencies.","Like, how does that evolve? I mean, because it sounds like you can really put the foot on the accelerator on the distribution front and I realize you touched on some of this in multiple answers about really creating this bespoke product. But, where do we go on the distribution front here?","J. Scott Kirby - President","Well, we'll see how it evolves. Where we are today is we're happy with \u2013 look, I'll start with the GDSs have a network that works all the links built. And so to the extent we're paying a reasonable price, we are happy to go through the GDSs and work with GDSs. All of the debate is about price. And our frustration, not shared just at American but I think a lot of airlines' frustration is, it's one of the few places in technology where prices have gone up a lot over the last 20 years because they've got monopoly market power in some cases.","That said, we'd like to work with the GDSs on doing things like selling our ancillary products. And we want them to sell it. It's good for our customers, it's good for their customers, the travel agencies, and then the customers that are flying that they represent. And so we're trying to do that. I think we're still all jointly figuring out how the GDS and distribution model evolve. But at least where we are today, I thank Sabre for getting this product out there. It's good for their customers, it's good for our customers, and it's nice that we've been able to find some common ground and work on something that's good for both of our respective customers.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Scott, do you think there's a scenario where you could create, I don't know, if it's just a product whether it's internally or something that's attractive to maybe bring the travel management companies to go by way of the Direct Connect sort of process, or is that...","J. Scott Kirby - President","Yeah. I don't think I can answer that question today.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Well, very good. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. A slightly different line of questioning, but on the ancillary revenue side, I was wondering if you could help kind of clarify a little bit of how much of the kind of other revenue pressure came from the reduction in change fees that you guys called out, and maybe whether trend was excluding that pressure? I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of what the underlying strength is.","J. Scott Kirby - President","I'm looking to Derek.","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'll work to get back to you on that. But I think...","J. Scott Kirby - President","I could tell you, conceptually, though, we've had a little bit of decline \u2013 some of those lines have declined a little bit as we've done things like maybe credit program, both credit card programs, first bag. So, if there's anything driving the decline, it's been a change as we've integrated to have the same set of benefits for all of our customers.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Great. And just then the follow-up on the domestic unit revenue kind of color that you provided. Just wondering how much of that is being impacted by kind of the international feed. I know you mentioned that a lot of the domestic hubs that have international feed are the ones that are under pressure. I'm wondering how much of that PRASM decline might be from the international component of the ticket or the domestic component of the international ticket?","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't remember the exact number, but it's over two points of the domestic decline is the domestic portion of international journeys.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. Derek, the $900 million improvement to the product, what are those improvements exactly? And then just tied to that, how would you characterize the return profile of these investments?","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The $900 million is the number of non-aircraft CapEx that we're spending, and part of that is with the product. And we've have already announced the $2 billion improvement to the product with lie-flat seats and those kind of amenities and the clubs and other things. So, the $900 million wasn't intended to be spent on improvement of the product. That's how much we're spending in capital for this year. That is non-aircraft CapEx.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the clarification. And then, Scott, not to kick a dead horse here, I actually will talk about something a little different. So, just keeping fuel prices constant, margin compression on the international entities, but there are some margin expansion initiatives that, I think, that you have under way to help offset and blunt some of those. And one of those, if I'm not mistaken, is just the RJ fleet restructuring. It's not something you guys have talked a lot about in the past, but I'm just wondering how material is the swap of the smaller RJs with the larger RJs to your overall margins?","J. Scott Kirby - President","It is a meaningful number. We haven't disclosed any specific margin or dollars associated with it. But we are rapidly swapping out the 50 seat and smaller regional jets and going to the larger regional jets which \u2013 the economics are great. And while we're running high load factors, we can feed more traffic onto our mainline network, feed more traffic onto our international flights and really helps the whole network get much better. It is one of the big contributors and will continue to be going forward as we continue that re-fleeting exercise.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And what percent of the departures are those that are being affected of the system departures?","J. Scott Kirby - President","What do you mean? What percentage are being...","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just the...","J. Scott Kirby - President","...are being upgraded?","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","...RJ departures as a percent of total that would be helping to drive this improvement?","J. Scott Kirby - President","I don't know the number exactly off the top of my head.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That's it. That'll do it for me. Thanks, guys.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for your time. I had a couple of questions on the international side. I wanted to start out with Brazil first of all. Just with regard to that market, do you feel like you're rightsized for it?","And I guess I'm just wondering earlier, I think a comment was made that the market will cover when effectively the macro does. And I guess I'm wondering like what do you need to see to potentially get more aggressive on capacity? Thanks.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Well, we've cut 30% of our capacity in Brazil. And so, we continue to look at the market, but we don't have any imminent plans to cut. We've cut 30%, but total capacity in the market is still up quite a bit and I think we're just, at the moment, hanging in there with what we have.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Tom, it's extremely important part of the world for American Airlines. We're the largest carrier to Brazil and the South America so it's \u2013 we've cut back as Scott said 30%, but that is not a market we're going to abandon because it's so important strategically to us.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, fair enough. I mean it's obviously the third largest domestic market in the world, and so you simply want good connectivity there. And then I guess just on the Atlantic side, can you give us an update in terms of the competitive landscape? And I guess more specifically, the JFK, Heathrow and I'm wondering if \u2013 with that sort of commentary if you could sort of update us on how your share has been progressing relative to your domestic peers? Thanks.","J. Scott Kirby - President","Well, we have the best partner across Atlantic in IAG and specifically in JFK. Heathrow, the partnership that we have with British Airways, we're doing quite well. We've increased share in that market and we're more than holding on our own against all competitors in that market.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Go to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll just ask two. Scott, just on the \u2013 if I look at kind of load factor trends the past couple of quarters compared to this one, there's a pretty noticeable increase in loads with some softening in yield. So, just wondering if there is a change in kind of the RM-System this quarter that drove some of that?","J. Scott Kirby - President","It's not so much a system change. The increase in load factor, well, we'll start across the wo whole industry, we all get better at squeezing people onto off-peak flights every year. And as much as anything for American, this was about getting more customers on off-peak flights, and the biggest increase in load factor on those off-peak flights was in markets where we're matching ultra-low-cost carriers.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I mean, domestically, can the load factor go beyond 88%? And then if you could just talk about how the revenue synergies start to phase and now do you have a single res system?","J. Scott Kirby - President","I don't know how far they can go. Every year that I get asked this, you think it's at the highest it can realistically be and then the next year it's higher. So I'm going to stop predicting when we'll have a peak in terms of load factor. In terms of synergy, the two biggest ones yet to come are full connectivity across the network prior to getting the single reservation system. If you went to usairways.com and AA.com, you would see different prices often times. That's a whole bunch of reasons in the old management systems.","Why that was different? That is now gone and we have effectively \u2013 we do have seamless availability between the two networks. And then the other one is moving aircraft around and putting the right-sized aircraft on the right route, again, prior to being on a single reservation system. We were limited in our ability to do that. We now have full reign to do that. That will take us a while to get done because there's also operational considerations to go along with that. And so, we'll start that next year, but we won't finish that piece of the integration really probably for 18 to 24 months.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me in here at the end. Just had one question, I guess this is for Derek. Certainly I appreciate your commentary just in terms of addressing the cash balance and balance sheet coming up here. But your debt has been picking up this year obviously, particularly in 3Q as you brought back a lot of stock. Do you feel comfortable with leverage levels higher than today, particularly as your earnings grow or would you like to see this come down over the next, call it, 18 to 24 months?","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. We'd like to see it come down. I mean, we're comfortable where we are today, but we'd like to see it come down over time. That's why we're going to look at \u2013 relook at everything from the leverage levels to the minimum cash, and try to figure out where we're going forward. But our plan is to bring it down over time.","Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","We'll go to Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Derek, any initial thoughts on 2016 CapEx at this point?","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We think it'll be around \u2013 we've said it's around $1 billion. We were at $900 million this year. Some of those reconfigurations that Scott had talked about that didn't get done this year are going to push into next year. So, we'll be around the, probably about $1.2 billion range for CapEx next year just due to some of the spending that we expected this year pushing into next year.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Would the gross number be about five times that?","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, no. That would just be the CapEx for non-aircraft. Aircraft CapEx is right around probably about $4.4 billion for aircraft CapEx.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Great.","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Combined, it's $5.6 billion, in that range.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for that.","Derek J. Kerr - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","And then, Doug, I've heard you say a few times this year that you don't think margins have peaked yet. And I guess I'd like it if you can put a little bit more meat on the bones there because the airline stock here is included, trading at single-digit P\/E multiples do seem to imply margin deterioration from here.","And just within the context of an industry that's earning probably above what most would consider it to be cost of capital and within that industry, your own margin seems already be very competitive at the high end of your peer group and a premium that Delta and United which holds even if kind of adjusted for the fuel losses away from you. So, I guess I wonder if your comment there regarding the forward margin progression was meant to be taken in an absolute sense or in a relative sense, and just generally speaking, why you think margins cannot just hold from here but actually higher? Thanks very much and apologies for the long-winded question.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No problem, Darryl, and I apologize in advance for hopefully what's not a really long-winded answer. But to the extent I said \u2013 anyway, here's what I believe which is the traditional \u2013 at least when I think of it as peak margins as though this is the best it's going to get, and you should expect declines from this point on. That's just not what this feels like at all.","I do believe that the 2015 margins probably were higher than this economic cycle should warrant given fuel prices fell so quickly. And when fuel prices fell that quickly, capacity which rightfully, when your largest cost of production falls by 50%, one should expect capacity to come in. And if demand stays the same and capacity comes in, then by definition, prices fall. And that happened, but that didn't happen in the first part of the year.","So, we probably had some artificially high margins for this point of the economic cycle at the start. So, if that's clear \u2013 so, therefore, we'll leave to you guys to project next year's margins, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if anyone was suggesting 2016 would be lower than 2015 margins with the exception of carriers that had large fuel hedges losses this year, which you should obviously adjust for.","There is apples-to-apples, paying the same amount for fuel year-over-year and not losing a lot on hedges, I would expect you'd see most all airlines have margins lower in 2016 and 2015 because of what I described. That's not because \u2013 it doesn't mean to me that the business gotten worse. It just means fuel prices fell so fast than you can respond in time. And then what it feels like to me is beyond 2016, you see margin increases. So do they get back to where 2015 was and when did that happen, I don't know, but of course, they can be higher than they were in 2015. And what I definitely don't believe is whatever they are in 2016, that they would be lower than that in 2017. It doesn't feel like bad at all. Is that clear?","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Well, thanks very much for that.","William Douglas Parker - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah."],"1301":["American Airlines Group, Inc.

Good day, and welcome to the American Airlines Group First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Now I would like to turn the call over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead. ","Dan Cravens","Thank you, Jake, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to the American Airlines First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.","Joining us on the call today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Kirby, our President; Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. And also in the room for our question-and-answer session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Bev Goulet, Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; and Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs.","As is our normal practice we are going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some color on our guidance for the remainder of 2015. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance; and then after we hear from those comments we\u2019ll open the call for analysts\u2019 questions and lastly questions from the media.","But before we begin we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, and load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31.","In addition we\u2019ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can also be found or can be found on our website at aa.com under the More About American Airlines Investor Relations section. Webcast of this call will be archived on our website and the information that we\u2019re giving you on the call is as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us this morning. At this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Dan. Thanks everyone for being on. We announce this morning record results for the first quarter of $1.2 billion in earnings excluding special charges, which is over three times the prior record of $400 million which we just set last year\u2019s first quarter. So obviously pleased with those results, pleased with the improvement year-over-year. The credit belongs to the 100,000 hardworking team members of American Airline. They are coming together exceptionally well to take care of our customers, and to restore America as the greatest airline of the world. That\u2019s evidenced by the great work that\u2019s being done by the team on integration. Most notably of late combining our frequent flyer programs into one single frequent flyer program, re-banking our DSW and Chicago hubs and getting to a single operating certificate from the FAA. So we have a lot of work ahead but the results today give us confidence we\u2019re on the right track and we\u2019re looking forward to the remainder of 2015 and beyond. ","With that said as Dan said I\u2019ll turn it over to Derek, then to Scott and then we\u2019ll open it to questions. Derek?","Derek Kerr","Thanks, Doug and good morning, everyone. As is our custom we filed our first quarter 2015 10-Q along with our press release this morning. As Doug said in our earnings release we reported a record net profit, excluding special charges of $1.24 billion or a $1.73 per diluted share. This represents an $841 million improvement versus our first quarter 2014 net profit excluding special credits of $402 million or $0.54 per diluted share.","Our first quarter 2015 pretax margin, excluding special charges, was 12.4%, up 8.6 points year-over-year. On a GAAP basis we reported a first quarter net profit of $932 million or a $1.30 per diluted share and this compares to a net profit of $480 million or $0.65 per diluted share at the same period last year. In the first quarter we did take delivery of 20 Mainline aircraft and retired 30 Mainline aircraft. On the regional side we took delivery of 16 aircraft and we removed from service and parked five Embraer 140 aircraft. ","We will continue our fleet replacement program throughout the year by taking delivery of 55 Mainline aircraft and 38 regional aircraft and retiring 73 Mainline aircraft and 17 regional aircraft. ","We have worked with our partners at Boeing in restructuring our 787 delivery schedule. Under the new revised agreement we\u2019ll reduce the number of aircraft delivered in 2016 by five aircraft. Four 787 aircraft that were scheduled for delivery in 2016 will now be delivered in 2017 and one aircraft will be deferred until 2018. We expect this revision to reduce our 2016 wide body capacity by approximately 2.5% and our system capacity by approximately 0.6% and it will also reduce our estimated 2016 gross aircraft CapEx. ","Total capacity for the quarter of 2015 was 62.8 billion ASMs down 0.9 from the same period in 2014. Mainline capacity for the quarter was 55.9 billion ASMs, down 1.7% and regional capacity was up 5.7% to 6.94 billion ASMs due to larger gauge aircraft, our longer stage length flying offset in part by fewer departures. While core demand remains healthy first quarter 2015 revenue was negatively impacted by industry capacity growth in some of our core markets, a stronger U.S. dollar and economy softness in Latin America. ","Total operating revenues were $9.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015, down 1.7% from the same period last year. Passenger revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, down 2.6% year-over-year with yields down 1.2% on a 0.9% decrease in system capacity. Cargo revenues were down 5.9% in the first quarter of 2015 to $194 million, due primarily to the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, weaker overall Latin demand and a declining cargo capacity. ","Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year primarily associated with our affinity card program which had a higher volume of new card acquisitions and increased average spend by existing card holders. Total RASM for the quarter of 2015 was $0.1565, down 0.7% driven principally by a decline in passenger revenue which was $0.1344, down 1.7% as compared to first quarter of 2014 and Scott will go into lot more detail in his comments after I finish. ","Helped by substantially lower fuel prices the Airline\u2019s operating expenses excluding net special charges for the first quarter of 2015 were $8.3 billion, down 11.7% year-over-year. We continue to see a material financial benefit resulting from the steep year-over-year decline in crude oil prices as we remain un-hedged. Average Mainline fuel price, including taxes for the first quarter of 2015 was a $1.83 per gallon, a 41% decline versus $3.10 per gallon in the first quarter of 2014. ","Driven primarily by the lower fuel price, Mainline operating CASM per ASM excluding net special charges was down 10.8% year-over-year to $0.1226 on the 1.7% decrease in Mainline ASMs. We recently announced that we had reached new five year joint collective bargaining agreements with our flight attendants and pilots. The costs associated with these agreements are reflected in our first quarter results and in our guidance for the remainder of the year. Excluding net special charges and fuel our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0949 in the first quarter, up 5.8%. This increase is due primarily due to higher salaries and benefits costs resulting from these contracts which increased our first quarter mainline CASM excluding special charges and fuel by approximately 3.6 percentage points.","Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding net special charges and fuel was $0.1647 for the first quarter of 2015, which was 0.9% lower than 2014 and excluding net special charges and fuel, our consolidated CASM was up 5.2%.","We ended the first quarter with $9.9 billion in total cash and investments, of which $757 million was restricted. The company also has an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1.8 billion bringing our total unrestricted liquidity to $11 billion, $644 million of which was held in Venezuelan bolivars.","As talked about on our last call we took advantage of historically attractive financing rates to fund a portion of our aircraft deliveries. During the first quarter of 2015 we completed two transactions including the issuance of $500 million of unsecured bonds, priced at 4.625%. and a $1.2 billion EETC at a blended fixed rate of 3.425%. In addition in early April we refinanced our $750 million 2014 slot, gate and route term loan reducing the margin by 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 300. This refinancing also reduced the collateral acquired under the loan and improved our future collateral flexibility. We are pleased with the economics associated with these transactions and continue to look for attractive opportunities in the market.","During the first quarter we generated $2.5 billion in cash flow from operations and $1.1 billion in free cash flow. We also paid down $746 million in debt, including prepaying $460 million in high cost debt. Looking forward we will continue to give priority to prepaying high cost debt when the opportunity arises. The company also returned $260 million to shareholders through the payment of $70 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $190 million of common stock or 3.8 million shares. This brings our shares purchased since the merger up to 27.2 million shares The company\u2019s first quarter weighted average fully diluted share count reduced by a net 7.8 million shares as compared to the fourth quarter 2014 primarily due to the effects of our share repurchase program. In addition the company\u2019s Board of Directors has declared a $0.10 per share dividend to shareholders of record as of May 4, 2015.","Turning now to 2015 guidance, in our last IR update two weeks ago we lowered full year overall system capacity guidance by a half of a point and are now forecasting it to be up approximately 2%. This growth is primarily driven by one, an increase of gauge from aircraft deliveries, higher seat density through aircraft reconfigurations and increased stage length.","As of today we are currently working on our fourth quarter schedules and we will update second half 2015 guidance in early April with a bias to continue to reduce capacity. Domestic capacity is expected to be up approximately 2% to 3% in 2015 while international capacity is expected to be up approximately 1%. By quarter mainline capacity in ASMs breaks down as follows; $61.9 billion in the second, $63.7 billion in the third and $58.9 billion in the fourth. Regional capacity breaks down as $7.6 billion in the second, $8 million in the third and $8.1 billion in the fourth. ","For the full year 2015 we are forecasting total CASM ex-special items and fuel to be up approximately 4% versus 2014. The increase is driven primarily by three items; the cost of a new labor contracts for both flight attendants and pilots, investment in new aircraft and costs dedicated to improving the reliability of our operation. Mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel is projected to be up approximately 3% to 5% in 2015 while regional CASM excluding special items and fuel is projected to be down approximately 1% to 3%.","By quarters for Mainline CASM second and third, up 2% to 4% and in the fourth quarter up between 4% to 6%. Regional CASM in the second quarter will be flat to up 2%, third quarter flat to down 2%, and the fourth quarter down, 3% to 5%.","As I mentioned in my earlier comments we have seen a substantial financial benefit as a result of significant drop in crude oil prices. Using the April 21 fuel curve we are forecasting our 2015 consolidated fuel price to be in the range of $1.89 to $1.94 per gallon which we believe will be the lowest economic price in the industry. Based on these prices we expect our 2015 consolidated fuel expense to improve by approximately $4.35 billion year-over-year. By quarter, the second quarter we believe will be $1.84 to $1.89, third quarter $1.93 to $1.98, and the fourth quarter $1.95 to $2. Regional fuel price will have the second quarter 186 to 191, third quarter 196 to 201, and the fourth quarter, 198 to 203.","Using the midpoints of the guidance we have provided along with the PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect a record second quarter pretax margin excluding special items of between 18% and 20%, up by more than 600 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2014. For the remainder of 2015 we continue to expect a large increase in operating cash flow driven by lower fuel prices. Going forward we will remain disciplined in our capital allocation process with a continued bias towards completing the integration, investing in the airline, paying down high-cost debt and returning excess cash to our shareholders.","In terms of capital expenditures, we are forecasting total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $5.4 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion will occur in the second quarter. In addition we expect to invest $1 billion for non-aircraft CapEx and make $2.1 billion in debt repayments in 2015. In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members we are very pleased to report another record quarter with our financial results. We were also able to complete several key milestones in our merger integration. While a lot of hard work remains as we complete our integration we continue to make tremendous progress and look forward to reporting strong financial results in the second quarter.","With that I will turn it over to Scott.","Scott Kirby","Thanks, Derek, and I\u2019d like to start by thanking all the people of American Airlines for the great job they continued doing operationally during the difficult first quarter and effectively managing all the change we have, like re-banking two hubs during the middle of some challenging weather events.","On the revenue front, our first quarter PRASM was down 1.7%, the stronger U.S. dollar had over a one point impact on our system PRASM declining international surcharges had a 0.4 point impact on system PRASM and Venezuela was approximately a 0.5 point drag on system PRASM.","Domestically the PRASM was down 1%, which given the significant capacity -- competitive capacity growth we have seen in Dallas and some of our other markets, a small decline in Q1 PRASM is indicative of healthy underlying domestic demand. Across specific PRASM was down 7% on 36% capacity growth. Currency and surcharge changes had a particularly large impact in this region and given our level of capacity growth combined with the currency effect we continue to be pleased with absolute demand at Asia. ","Latin was down 6% but it really is the tail of Brazil and Venezuela versus the rest of Latin America. Despite double-digit industry growth Mexico and the Caribbean were essentially flat on RASM, meaning that demand grew rapidly to keep pace with the large capacity increase. Argentina appears to be recovering, leading to positive year-over-year PRASM but we experienced large PRASM declines in Brazil and Venezuela.","And finally the Atlantic was our strongest region for PRASM, up 3% year-over-year. In the Atlantic we were also pleased with the absolute demand given the currency and capacity headwinds. We made some significant progress this year on integration and some of the recent integration highlights, which Doug talked about as well included our pilots ratified a new five year contract, we received our single operating certificate from the FAA on the very day and schedule that we originally planned a year and half ago and we have successfully completed one of the most technically difficult integration projects that we have to do and we combined into a single frequent flyer program and we rebanked both the DFW and Chicago hubs and our teams are doing a great job operationally so far with the new schedule. ","We have a lot more hard work left in 2015, including combining to a single reservation system in the fourth quarter, so we can\u2019t rest on our laurels but we are very proud of all that the AA has done so far and the first few months of 2015 saw us achieve some significant integration milestones.","Turning to the outlook going forward, the comps are more difficult in the second quarter than any other quarter this year. We also have some big headwinds including an expected two point system PRASM impact from currency, 0.7 point impact from the continuing decline in international surcharges and 0.5 point impact from Venezuela. And of course the continuing pressure from industry capacity growth in all regions. ","At American we saw the supply demand imbalance beginning to build last year and have now reduced our international capacity versus prior guidance for four quarters in a row. And while our proactive approach to international capacity is helping our PRASM result it's not enough to overcome the currency and capacity headwinds.","Given all of this we expect PRASM to be down in all regions of the world with the largest declines occurring in the Pacific and Latin America and we forecast that our overall system PRASM will be down 4% to 6% year-over-year in the second quarter. ","As we move beyond 2Q, the comps do get easier and we'll overlap the Venezuela drawdown, so all of us [indiscernible] would expect the year over year -PRASM comparisons to improve as well. While we never like to see negative PRASM we do believe that demand remains fundamentally strong in almost all areas of the world with the exceptions of Brazil and Venezuela. Currency and surcharge changes unfortunately mask some of that core demand strength and high single digit capacity growth in all region pressures otherwise growing demand that while healthy is not growing as fast as capacity. ","In conclusion we're very encouraged with the operating integration and financial results at American Airlines and while there are some near term capacity and currency headwinds, demand environment remains strong and we remain positive about the long term demand trends. ","Doug Parker","Thanks Scott. Thanks Derek. Operator we are ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll take first, William Greene with Morgan Stanley. ","William Greene","Good morning. Hey, Derek can I ask for some commentary on the cash side. I realize you've got still some big milestones to come on integration, but can you talk about your appetite to return more to shareholders, going forward. It feels like there is going to be a pretty big build here that could still drive some pretty big buybacks but how are you thinking about that?","Derek Kerr","Yes, I think as we go through this, as I said earlier that we do, as you said too, is make sure we get done with the integration. So we have set aside a certain amount of cash to get through the integration. We do have a lot of aircraft coming in. So we do want to have cash to pay for that aircraft and then past that, I mean as you saw in the first quarter and you've seen what we have done over the last, since the merger, buying back in over 20 million shares, we do plan on returning cash to the shareholders. ","We did do $190 million in the first quarter and we do have the $2 billion program that's out there and we plan to do that over the next two years. So we do -- that is our plan, how fast we do that is a question but as of right now we want to keep more cash than we need to get through the integration and get through the merger and then begin doing that. But you've seen we've done a significant amount, over $2 billion worth of share repurchases going back, including all of the other things that we've done. So we plan on doing it and we plan on continuing to return throughout the year. ","William Greene","Okay. And then just one follow-up here on the fleet you mentioned you've got a lot of aircraft coming in. Can you also talk a little bit about your thoughts on some of your peers sort of trying out a used aircraft strategy, is that something that intrigues you at all or is that just we've got fleet plan we're going to stick with it. ","Derek Kerr","We have a fleet plan and we're going to stick with it. We have a lot of aircraft on order to replace all of our older MD 80s, 75s and 76s, have plans in place and we plan on going down that path. We have enough aircraft on order for replacement and that's the method we're going to go down for the next three or four years. ","William Greene","That's great. I appreciate the time. ","Doug Parker","Thanks Will. ","Operator","And now we'll hear from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. ","James Baker","Hey good morning everybody. First question for Scott, can the A321 in your low density configuration operate Trans continent [ph] at LaGuardia without taking a C Block and what are your views on potentially lifting the perimeter rule. ","Scott Kirby","Yes, we could operate out of La Guardia and our views on LaGuardia perimeter rule are that the facility we have a challenge handling all the customers we have in the facility today. And if the perimeter rule is lifted we would have a lot of large aircrafts with long haul flying out of LaGuardia of course. And so we need the facility to be prepare to handle those customers before you really even consider to enter. So I think our issue is mostly focused on the logistics of having the facility able to handle that number of people before you -- before you consider changing the parameter rule and having a much higher volume of customers. ","James Baker","But you're not taking the position against the possibility with the port. ","Scott Kirby","No, but our view would be that we need to get the facility work done first. ","James Baker","Yes, got it. And a follow up for Doug, Doug good morning your closest international partner is on the exact opposite side of you as it relates to the issue of Middle Eastern competition and illegal subsidies. And how contentious are your discussions these days with Willie Walsh on this topic? I mean are you just sort of reluctantly holding him to Delta and United on this issue, or from a modeling perspective, I'm sure we don't need to model for an outright divorce from British Air. But might this disagreement nonetheless represent a spat that could potentially strain profitability? ","Doug Parker","Well to your last question, no, you shouldn't model anything and we're working even more closely with British Airways on ways to improve the profitability of the joint venture. We do have a disagreement to this issue but it doesn't have -- has no effect on our relationship or certainly on our -- on the joint venture. This is -- and as to whether or not Americans are reluctantly holding hands, no we're all in on this. We think the situation in the Middle East is serious and needs to be addressed and if it's not addressed it could have material consequences to our industry overtime. ","We believe it will be addressed so all those things and BA just has a different perspective for different reasons but the other European carriers have seen severe impact to their profitability because of the growth of these subsidized airlines and we don't care to see that happen in the United States. So that's our position, we're all in all on it but it has no impact whatsoever on our relationship with British Airways. ","James Baker","Okay. Thanks a lot for the color. I appreciate it, Scott and Doug. Take care. ","Operator","And now we'll move to a question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. ","Hunter Keay","Thanks, good morning everybody. ","Doug Parker","Good morning. ","Hunter Keay","Hey Scott, wondering we haven't talked about synergies in a while, wondering if you can give us an update as sort of where we are on that, if you have captured really any on the revenue side and wondering if at this point you want to maybe revise the target higher or even lower. Is it to too soon to think that revenue synergies might manifest themselves and some driving outperformance is really for third quarter? ","Scott Kirby","So I think there are a lot of synergies and I know that there are a lot of synergies in our numbers today. Although some of the big ones won't come until after we get to a single reservation system. So some of the biggest things are the connectivity of the network, moving aircraft around re-gauging the airline and putting the right sized aircraft in the optimal market, those kinds of revenue synergies can't occur until after you get to single operating certificate or a single reservation system in the fourth quarter. So those things are yet to come but they probably won't be third quarter impacts, they will be 2016 impacts. ","Hunter Keay","Okay good. And that\u2019s sort of a good segue into next question. As you think about 2016, how many of the deferred 787 deliveries relate just directly to the issue at the seat manufacturer versus you guys actually saying there is a little bit too much supply that\u2019s mismatched with demand in international markets. And how did the aircraft deferral sort of translate into how you're thinking about overall 2016 capacity growth? Thanks. ","Scott Kirby","So the deferrals have absolutely nothing to do with the seat manufacture. We think it will be back on time long before these aircrafts are delivered. And so this is all about trying to do more to match supply to demand. And while we haven\u2019t given 2016 capacity guidance I mean clearly we\u2019ve been -- it\u2019s the fourth quarter in a row we\u2019ve been ahead of the view of supply and demand not being in balance or being imbalanced and so I think that philosophy will continue to guide us as we move into 2016. The only thing we\u2019ve done that\u2019s concrete so far is this pushing back aircraft deliveries but we\u2019ve actually accelerated retirements of some of other aircraft MD 80s and 767s which will impact 2016 capacity and we\u2019ll have more to come on 2016 capacity but that -- as long as we look at a world where supply and demand are out of balance and you\u2019re having negative PRASM our bias will certainly be to the downside. ","Hunter Keay","Thanks a lot, Scott. ","Operator","And Julie Yates with Credit Suisse has the next question. ","Julie Yates","Good morning, with the competitive capacity additions on the Trans-Atlantic this summer and with the currency headwinds do you expect that you can return to positive unit revenues in the Trans-Atlantic in Q3?","Doug Parker","I don\u2019t have a forecast for Q3, so can\u2019t really specifically comment on that. But Trans-Atlantic, even in 2Q, which has the big bump in the competitive capacity out of Heathrow, in particular and also has the headwinds from the currency, we expect to kind of be neck-in-neck for being the best region in the world, tied with domestic for us. And so it\u2019s certainly not inconceivable it would be positive in 3Q but we just don\u2019t have a forecast that\u2019s very accurate that far out. ","Julie Yates","Understood and then in your Q4 schedule overview are you also considering cutting any domestic capacity in response to the competitive pressures that you\u2019re seeing?","Doug Parker","Well, we look at everywhere and look at every market that we serve but when you look at the competitive markets for competitive capacity, our capacity is up, they\u2019re probably not the kind of markets where we\u2019re going to cut just because they are highly profitable markets and they are places that when you have a lower fares, actually demand is higher. So it\u2019s fine, happens in the normal kind of schedule review process in some of those markets while we don\u2019t add flights we would have a tendency to up-gauge flights so a 737 becomes an A321 and so those markets typically just in the normal course process become higher capacity markets. That\u2019s capacity that moves from some of the markets into those markets just because absolute demand in terms of number of customers is higher. ","So we haven\u2019t done that, we don\u2019t have specifics yet for domestic market but I\u2019d be surprised if we had a material change in the domestic markets. We\u2019re much more focused on the international. ","Julie Yates","Okay, understood. Thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. ","Mike Linenberg","Hey, good morning everybody. Hey, Derek when you were going over the aircraft deferrals, I think I missed this what was the -- you talked about a reduction in gross CapEx, what\u2019s the rough number you may have said?","Derek Kerr","We didn\u2019t say a number, just because then you know what the amount we pay for the aircraft is. ","Mike Linenberg","That\u2019s right, five airplanes. Okay, not a problem.","Derek Kerr","Boeing doesn\u2019t like that. ","Mike Linenberg","Not a problem.","Doug Parker","And it did, Mike just so you know, obviously it is most of \u201817 and \u201818 so\u2026","Mike Linenberg","That\u2019s right, very good. And then just my next question then just looking at your regional cost reduction, I mean you can see how the restructuring of Envoy [ph], looks like it\u2019s really starting to take hold and I just -- I wanted to know, have you now fully allocated all of the regional aircraft that you\u2019re looking to deploy over the next couple of years? I mean are we done with Envoy and the regional fleet restructuring or is there more to come because I feel like that there\u2019s been significant -- the opportunity to generate some real savings from this side over the next couple of years because I do think you\u2019re probably going to have some of the lowest regional cost lift of any carrier out there?","Scott Kirby","Well, the restructuring will continue in terms of going from 50 seaters to 76 seat aircraft and so that so -- is going to run and will continue over the next at least 12 to 24 months. ","Mike Linenberg","Okay, very good. Thanks Scott. ","Scott Kirby","Thanks, Mike. ","Operator","And now we\u2019ll hear from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. ","Helane Becker ","Thanks operator. Hi guys. Thank you very much for the time. So Doug, I'm very impressed that you decided to just get all your compensation in equity instead of cash and equity. So how are you thinking about that?","Doug Parker","Thanks Helane, thank you. The thoughts are, one it seems to be that my compensation should be paid in the same currencies we ask our shareholders to accept because we should have interests that are highly aligned. In the end I think though to the extent you all can infer [ph] what this means, I think it\u2019s one more piece of the evidence that it\u2019s been really different this time and investors keep asking is it really different this time, you guys have said in the past, everything you get profitable so this is [ph] times you remain profitable. I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if I thought we were still the same order line business because it is not and I don\u2019t think anybody, I don\u2019t think any executive over the last 15-20 years would have been willing to take all their compensation in equity because we all knew the equity had an enormous risk, we are not suggesting there is not still risk in the airline stocks but we are really bullish on what the outlook is for years to come. ","So I am more than happy to be compensated the same way you are.","Helane Becker ","You know I thank for you response. I just feel like, listening to you and all of your competitors talk about competitive capacity growth it is hard to get over -- it is not the same old airline industry because you are still seeing a lot of capacity going into markets that probably shouldn\u2019t be there. So I applaud your decision. I just wonder about the competitive market and how it\u2019s going to be\u2026","Doug Parker","Yeah, I guess, now you got me scared.","Helane Becker ","It wasn\u2019t the intent though.","Doug Parker","No, I am just kidding. It is not the same. It is nothing like what we saw in the past when airlines got first with the profitability and then use that to say well, I had, if I could be profitable with 100 airplanes just think how profitably it would be with 150. This is what\u2019s going on now again we can only now look at it and say the demand is growing faster -- I mean supplies is growing faster than demand and in some cases it is. But the rates of growth we are taking about are nothing like we see in the past. ","Where the growth comes from is nothing like we saw in the past, and people aren\u2019t looking to start up new hubs in different parts of the country. People are growing their strength into markets. Again maybe in excess of the near-term demand but that\u2019s nothing like what we saw in the past and where you just saw all these wild changes in year-over-year profitability we will find out when you get in the next down cycle but I am really confident that what we\u2019ll see is, yes, still a cyclical business but the peaks are much, much higher than they were before and therefore the troughs are going to be really much, much higher and I think the swings are going to be much less.","Helane Becker ","That\u2019s great. I hope you are right. So I appreciate that. Thank you very much and have a nice day.","Operator","And we will now hear from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask some follow-up on your Venezuela commentary. Obviously you are comping against some capacity cuts when RASM is really high there. But was your comment about Venezuela specific to a comps issue or you are seeing incremental demand weakness there?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t know it is hard to sort that, it\u2019s a such a big decline that I am not sure if it is incremental demand weakness or just the year-over-year effect. But it is clearly -- got some challenges right now.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Yeah, I guess the point is you feel like you get beyond those year-over-year cuts by the third quarter and that minimum it should be less of headwind in the second-half of the year. ","Scott Kirby","It is certainly less of the headwind, the capacity issue and the selling in bolivars issue is less of a headwind. By the time you reach the third quarter and by the time you are at third quarter that will be the kind of organic question you are asking of what\u2019s happening to demand and I suspect that Venezuela will still be down on a RASM basis because it has got incrementally weaker but the impact that our system will be a whole lot smaller than it\u2019s been for the last 12 months. The year-over-year impact will be much smaller. Even though it maybe down a lot, it will be on much more capacity base and it will be down less than it was in first quarter and second quarter because you won\u2019t have the bolivar dollar ticket selling issue.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Got it, thanks. And then just following up on the pace of capital return, can you provide any detail on -- obviously you had a huge statement in the fourth quarter which may have gotten people\u2019s expectations pretty high in terms of the run rate there and then a much more modest level in the first quarter. Can you quantify or just give us some thought process, details on how you thought what the level into the first quarter?","Doug Parker","It\u2019s Doug. Look we would just encourage you not to make strong conclusions based on the quarterly reports of our share repurchases. The facts are we have announced a very large share repurchase program. We demonstrated overtime our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. But look for obvious reasons we got to be careful what we disclose about the program and what our intent is on the program, what we will disclose is how much we actually purchased each quarter and that\u2019s what we can do. But know this we are not going to be systematic or ratable in our purchases quarter-by-quarter but we are absolutely committed to returning excess cash to shareholders because it is your cash. But really we just ask you not try and make strong conclusions based on quarterly reports on the program.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay very fair, thank you.","Doug Parker","Thanks.","Operator","Now we will take a question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel J. McKenzie","Hey, good morning guys, thanks. With respect to the buyback, can you talk about the longer term balance sheet goals; on the one hand the cost of debt lowers the cost of capital. So it makes sense to keep more of it, which suggests potential larger share buyback than investors perhaps appreciate, and so I guess I am just wondering what is the right level of debt looking ahead?","Doug Parker","Okay, it was my turn again, anyway I have reasonably strong views on this. So our view is that the best thing for our shareholders is not to go try and target any particular debt-to-equity ratio, target rating. That\u2019s not to suggest to the rating agencies or to our debt holders that we are not concerned about such things. What we know is though in our business, certainly at American it seems at this point in time that the right thing is to be, given that we can borrow at the rates we are borrowing, which don\u2019t seem to reflect the credit rating that we have today. ","We think the right thing to do is to borrow, certainly on aircraft which is the debt we have coming, or as much as we can and because the rates we are getting are sub-4% and borrow at those rates and continue to lever, if you will, and it\u2019s to the extent -- because we can generate higher returns than that for our shareholders. And with the cash that we don\u2019t -- though we are generating returns which we return to our shareholders because [ph] you can generate higher returns than that. ","So that\u2019s our view on this that the -- this focus on de-levering and could be contrary to our shareholders\u2019 best interest. So our goal is to make sure that we are actually doing this intelligently and making sure that to the extent that we have the ability to borrow at rates below what we can earn or that we can return to you, we should continue to borrow irrespective of what that may do to some ratio. So anyway that\u2019s a long winded way trying to answer your question Daniel but we are not heavily focused nor we can give targets to you on credit ratios.","Daniel J. McKenzie","Understood, thanks Doug. And then Derek what percent of the aircraft are you financing this year exactly and is that a fair run rate going forward as we think about 2016 and beyond?","Derek Kerr","I think our value [ph] in the WTC transaction it was around 80% of the aircraft. So I think I would use that number as you move forward. What we have in the cash flow guidance today is only transactions that have been completed versus transaction that are contemplated just so you have the right numbers in there. But the run rate that we did in the first quarter on those deliveries is probably a pretty good run rate going forward.","Daniel J. McKenzie","Fantastic, thanks guys.","Operator","And now we will take a question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth","Hey good morning. I wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on what you are seeing from a corporate demand perspective and maybe particularly out of Dallas?","Derek Kerr","Well, corporate demand is strong. Revenue results are down at Dallas because of the capacity situation, fares are down and there is a lot more competitive capacity. So revenue is down but corporate demand in total is strong and given the capacity situation in Dallas, I think we view demand in Dallas as strong as well. ","Savanthi Syth","Got it. And then to follow up, on the Latin front given the weakness that you're seeing in the market in maybe specifically two countries, is there anything that you're doing on the capacity front to address that or is it something you are just going have to absorb?","Scott Kirby","So we cut capacity to Brazil or to Venezuela by over 70% and we've cut capacity to Brazil about 20%. So we've done that and to this point not a lot more left to have to come from American Airlines. ","Savanthi Syth","Got it and just on that, just following up on the U.S. dollar strength, how much of a benefit is that on the cost side from -- that offsets the revenue pressure?","Derek Kerr","There was about -- in this quarter there was about $36 billion of benefit on the expense side. ","Savanthi Syth","All right, great, thank you. ","Operator","And next we'll take a question from Joe DeNardi with Stifel. ","Joe DeNardi","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Derek, maybe just a quick one on the 787, did any of that deferral have to do with the kind of the economics of that airplane, given lower fuel or was it strictly a capacity decision? ","Derek Kerr","Strictly a capacity decision. ","Joe DeNardi","Okay, and then on some of the rebankings you guys have gone through, I guess we only have maybe a few weeks of data. But has the revenue improvement met your expectations at this point and maybe what are the cost impact as well? ","Derek Kerr","It's too early for us to try to measure the revenue impact there particularly when the first two weeks of it are overlapping last year, and a change in the Easter. So it's early to measure the revenue impact and probably too early to really measure the cost impacts. Operationally I'll let Robert talk. ","Robert Isom","Operationally it's been a tremendous success on all the important metrics, whether it's starting the day out or departing and arriving on time throughout the day, connecting customers and baggage. We've been very pleased with the results, certainly in Dallas and especially in Chicago. ","Derek Kerr","And Joe, this is Derek, from a cost standpoint we added costs into those areas which is built into our CASM guidance or about there. It's probably about a quarter point of CASM with the headcount and another things that we put out at those airports. So that is already build into all the guidance that you have from our kind of CASM numbers. ","Joe DeNardi","Okay and Scott I think you spoke recently at a conference about some of the competitive pressures you're seeing from some ultra-low cost carriers. Has that changed the way that you are planning on competing against them going forward given some the share that they have in certain of your markets.","Derek Kerr","I guess it depends on, I\u2019d say the final change from -- we're competing using a lot more of the tactics, I think that perhaps we had used it US Airways where we had a bigger overlap with low cost carriers than American did. So probably as a level that is more aggressive perhaps in terms of competition. But were you really using a similar playbook that we used there but we were -- we had a whole lot more low cost carrier competition than American had had historically and now our network at American looks a lot more like level of competition that US Airways used to have particularly because of the changes here at Love Field. ","Joe DeNardi","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","And now we'll move to a question from Darryl Genovesi from UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just one for Scott. Some of the U.S. Airlines are taking the domestic up-gauging strategy a little bit further than just adding some line seats and replacing 50 seaters with 76 seaters. I guess you've had the 717s coming in at Delta and then United, I guess now bringing in 757s and in particular the 777 in the domestic market. At what point do we start to worry that the domestic up-gauging is going too far and I guess are you contemplating any similar moves to perhaps bring more wide bodies into the domestic market. ","Scott Kirby","Well, I think Up-gauging within a class makes all the economics sense in the world for an individual airline. But going from 50 to 76 seats, going from an A-320 to an A-321, up-gauging in terms of wide body size 787-8 to -9 because the marginal cost of those is much lower. We're talking about going between classes. We certainly aren\u2019t going to spring wide bodies out [ph] domestically. It's lower cost to provide two narrow bodies than it is to provide a single wide body for the same amount of seats. ","So that's not something that we're planning to do. But we are doing the same thing as others on -- as we get to trend that and it's really the higher profitability. It is pressuring RASM, on the cost system but we will get -- every airline is supporting record profitability in the first quarter and second quarter for the full year. And one of the things that's helping everyone report profitability, record profitability is up-gauging and getting more seats on aircraft. It's also one of the important ways that we can compete more effectively with ultra-low cost carriers. There is real advantages cramming as many seats as possible on an airplane. So we fly bigger airplanes and spread the cost of flying the aircraft out over more seats, it makes us that much more competitive with ultra-low cost carriers.","Darryl Genovesi","Great, thanks for that. And then I guess Derek, maybe just if you wouldn\u2019t mind can you provide an update on I guess the current view on when, if you even have a current view on when you might think about reversing the valuation allowance on the NOL. ","Derek Kerr","Yes, I think we're going to take a view and look at that at the end of the year. So I think that is probably the timeframe. We want to get through the integration and get through the res migrations, which happens in the fourth quarter and then I think for modeling purposes I believe the val allowance will probably be reversed at the end of the year and then have book taxes in 2016 but no cash taxes until the NOL of about $10 billion runs off. ","Darryl Genovesi","Okay, and then on the fuel guidance I guess fuel has been pretty volatile here. I guess I was expecting it to move up a little bit more than it did. Can we think of this fuel market being kind of as of today, or is this sort of already stale just because of some of the volatility we've had in recent days. ","Derek Kerr","That's pegged as of April 21st. So I think it was pegged like a couple of days ago. ","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it guys. ","Operator","Tom Ken [ph] with Goldman Sachs has the next question. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Scott I have a follow-up to a comment you made earlier about maintaining an elevated cash level during the integration. So given your operating cash flow outlook which is very bullish and your $10 billion in cash, can you help us understand why you wish to maintain an elevated level during the integration, like what are some of things that you're concerned about that drive this? ","Derek Kerr","This is Derek. We put aside cash to integrate the airline and we said it was going to be $1.2 billion, $1.25 billion to integrate the airline. We still got a lot of work to do. We still got a lot of integration to complete, a lot of capital to deploy, as we re-do the hubs and things that we just, that we've talked about earlier. So a lot of that cash is earmarked for those kind of things as we move forward and is built into our long range plan, which would have us elevated levels this year and maybe a little bit into next year. ","Doug Parker","This is Doug. To be clear we haven't said that the existing level is the right level. We said all the while it was simply that we think we -- which is accurate we believe as we go through integration we should hold more than other airlines our size or relative or similar sizes we're not trying to suggest that the existing level is the proper level, that\u2019s really sure. I just want to be clear on that. That's not the point we're trying to make, it\u2019s simply that we should be holding more than others as we go through integration and they aren't. ","Unidentified Analyst","That's fair enough. Would you be able to give us a sense of like what you think the right cash to revenue figures should be long term, like obviously you're at north of 20% now. ","Derek Kerr","It's hard to say long term when we're so focused on the near term again through integration. Other airline, you can look where other airlines, again similar size to us what their ratios are and my guess is they're being prudent. So you could view that perhaps as a prudent level but we haven't come to such conclusion yet. We're focused right now in going through the integration. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then just with regard to pricing can you frame out how much international PRASM decline in the first quarter was due to FX translation and how much might have been related to international fuel surcharges? ","Derek Kerr","Yes, it was a little over a point for currency and about half a point, I think four points in the first quarter for surcharges. ","Unidentified Analyst","And then can you sort frame that for your 2Q guide as well?","Derek Kerr","Yes, it\u2019s two points for currency and 0.7 for surcharge. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks a lot. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Mike Kardarshian [ph], Sterne Agee. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, yes, it\u2019s Sterne Agee, [indiscernible] just merged there. ","Doug Parker","Congratulations Michael. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good to talk with you. I want to go back to [indiscernible] question, Doug as a large shareholder I'm sure one of the things in mind was your current valuation being as low as it is and certainly your confidence in management and executing its business plan, if you might have some insight information of that. And I'm curious about the comment about, we really won\u2019t know it\u2019s different until the next recession. I'm not so sure that\u2019s correct and I just wanted to explore that one with you. I mean certainly one could do a sensitivity analysis and say that the fed goes crazy and all of a sudden we have a recession next year. I mean it would take an incredibly large drop in RASM next year for you guys to go into the red. I think you would agree with that. ","So and obviously a lot of other things have happened changes to your business model that are permanent changes, they\u2019re not going to go away in the next recession. They will actually get a buffer thing. So I'm just wondering if you, particularly as a shareholder you are looking at valuations which are really being negatively affected by this perception that you guys are going to lose billions of dollar again in the next recession, if you can add some color to that. ","Doug Parker","Mike, I can\u2019t agree with you more and you said it better than I did. If -- I'm sure I said what you said is which is we won\u2019t know next recession that, what I believe is we will prove it in the next downturn. What I believe is what you just said, which is if anyone doesn\u2019t believe it yet, we\u2019ll prove it in the next downturn, is what I was trying to communicate. I believe exactly what you just said, which is anybody that really takes the time to study the industry and where it is now versus where it\u2019s been in the past knows that it\u2019s different. ","I certainly know that it\u2019s different therefore I'm confident doing what I have done. And I think not to suggest that people that first thing I'm not sure yet, I haven\u2019t studied that properly but I think I just want it heard [ph] to look at what\u2019s happening today versus what\u2019s happened in the past and not come to conclusions it is different. Where the level of earnings is much higher than it\u2019s been in the past and it\u2019s unclear. I don\u2019t think this is peak. ","So the peaks are certainly higher and the volatility is less and the things that we worry about are much less dramatic than the kinds of things we worried about in the past, in terms of supply versus demand growth. So I'm with you completely and like I said you said better than I did. So I wasn\u2019t trying to congest that this is an open question in our mind and we\u2019ll find out in the downturn, what I meant to say what I should have said was it has changed and if you don\u2019t believe it yet I guess we have to wait until there\u2019s a downturn to prove it to you, but we\u2019ll prove it to you then. But those who figure out now will reap the benefits of that instead of ebbing away. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks Doug, well said. ","Doug Parker","Thank you for helping me say it better. ","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s what I'm here for. ","Doug Parker","All right, thanks Michael. ","Operator","And now at this time we would like to invite the members of the media the opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will hear first from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. ","Mary Schlangenstein","Hey Scott can you clarify for me, did you say that American has revised capacity downward four quarters in a row or were you just talking about international capacity?","Scott Kirby","It would be both, it\u2019s been on the international side but overall capacity has come down four quarters in a row from our prior guidance. ","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay and if you can clarify for me a little bit, a couple of time as you\u2019d referred to demand being strong but capacity additions outstripping demand. So when you do something like the further Dreamliners is it on just because you don\u2019t want to add capacity to a market that already has too much or is it that the demand itself is slowing so you\u2019re seeing lower demand as well?","Scott Kirby","No, it\u2019s really more the former, that while demand is still growing it\u2019s not growing as fast as supply. ","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay, and is that worldwide?","Scott Kirby","It\u2019s mostly worldwide yes. ","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay, great, okay, thank you.","Operator","And now David Koenig with The Associated Press has the next question.","David Koenig ","Hi, good morning, folks.","Doug Parker","Hey David.","David Koenig ","I guess as a follow-up or maybe rephrasing Michael Derchin\u2019s [ph] question, are you going to be able to keep growing the profits, when you start lapping the collapse fuel prices and if so how?","Scott Kirby","Well we certainly hope so. We will have to get there and when we start getting to a point in time where fuel prices are up year-over-year, that really means is we will have to have RASM growing and because that\u2019s just the way math works. We will have to get to a world where RASM is growing and I hope that will be a guess.","David Koenig ","But I mean how do you do that beyond just you know scaling back your planned increases in capacity?","Scott Kirby","Well we there\u2019s all kinds of things we do to try to manage the business and have always historically done to try to increase revenues and we will continue to do all of those things. It is not just about capacity, we will continue to -- we will continue -- we will get synergies from the merger, we will continue to have -- win new customers from the great product that we are putting out there. And there is a lot of things that we can do that are independent of the macroeconomic environment to make American Airlines a better airline, the preferred airline of our customers and that can lead to higher revenues even if we have macroeconomic challenges.","David Koenig ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram has the next question.","Andrea Ahles","Hi, good morning.","Doug Parker","Hey, Andrea.","Andrea Ahles","I wanted to ask a very profitable [ph] question about Dallas\/Fort Worth. Can you talk a little bit more about the competitive pressures you are getting from Southwest and their continuing growth, I believe they aren\u2019t even done adding all of what they have announced and if you are considering any capacity cuts, then domestically at DFW because of the competition you are seeing and the capacity increases you are seeing just in our local market here.","Scott Kirby","So I may have answered this question less directly to one of the analysts that I thought it was referring to -- though he didn\u2019t say DFW and the short answer is no. We are not planning to cut capacity in DFW markets. What actually might have happened is when fares go down one, these are all important markets for us, profitable markets, markets that are critical, the DFW hubs that connect customers from all the other destinations we fly and there is no chance that you pull any of these roots out the network. ","So why is that happening is you have lower fares, you will see you have absolute levels of demand that are higher. So at lower prices economics one-on-one you have more customers that want to buy the ticket at those prices and so you have more people showing up. So typically what happened is in many of these routes we\u2019ll wind up actually having more having more capacity not by adding more frequencies or adding more flights but by simply up-gauging to larger aircraft, that these are [indiscernible] as we are taking more large aircraft like A321 and as we do that we have the opportunity to put them in routes and serve a larger segment of the customer in those markets. So no chance to reduce -- no plans to reduce capacity in those markets.","Andrea Ahles","So the softness that you are seeing on the fare side because you are lowering fare to compete and the softness of it, is it still sort of on that promotional softness side or are you sort of seeing, at least some stabilization on -- out of this market?","Scott Kirby","Yeah, I don\u2019t know if it is promotional or if it\u2019s permanent, I tend to be more in the camp of this is the new equilibrium point when the supply curve moves that much, economics one-on-one the price, the clearing price changes and I tend to think that we are near the clearing price. I don\u2019t know if we, for sure we are not, but we are pricing to the demand and supply as it exists in the market today.","Andrea Ahles","All right, thank you.","Operator","And Jeffrey Dastin with Thomson Reuters has the next question.","Jeffrey Dastin","Thanks. Could you break out any capacity change to Japan and clarify the timeline for Brazil and Venezuela capacity front?","Scott Kirby","No change to Japan that we have, and Venezuela capacity cuts were last year in the third quarter of last year and Brazil has been coming online in the beginning in the third quarter, really fourth quarter of last year through today.","Jeffrey Dastin","Okay, but might there be capacity cuts to Japan in the coming quarters?","Scott Kirby","If there was we wouldn't be able to tell you in advance if they are but there is nothing loaded or planned. ","Jeffrey Dastin","Got it and if I just may one completely separate question. How is American preparing for fed rate hikes?","Scott Kirby","For what? ","Jeffrey Dastin","For Federal reserve rate hikes. ","Scott Kirby","We're not doing anything specific for the federal reserve rate hike. ","Jeffrey Dastin","Okay great. Well, thank you very much. ","Scott Kirby","Thank you. ","Operator","Now we'll hear from Edward Russell with Flightglobal. ","Edward Russell","Hi yes. I've been looking at the loads on your new flights in Dallas\/Fort Worth Hong Kong and Shanghai last year. And I noticed that they're significantly below where it was when you launched that in 2013. Can you give me -- do you have any view on how it's performing and whether you potentially plan to down gauge Hong Kong as you have done in Shanghai? ","Scott Kirby","Those routes are doing really well and we're happy with them and that's at best very imperfect to way judge a route performance. It depends on what the fares are in the market and in particular how much premium business, you look at market like Hong Kong actually and it\u2019s our best premium market across the Pacific. So those routes are performing above expectations and we're happy with how they're doing. ","Edward Russell","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude your question-and-answer session. I'll be happy to turn the call back over to your host for closing remarks. ","Doug Parker ","All right, thank you all very much for your interest. We appreciate it, and thanks again. ","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, with that, that will conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. "],"1310":["American Airlines Group, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","And now I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the American Airlines second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room we have, for Q&A session, Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Stephen Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior VP of Revenue Management.","We are going to start the call with Doug and he will provide an overview of our second quarter 2017 financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risk and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.","In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website at AA.com. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no under obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everyone, for being on the line. This morning, we reported pre-tax earnings, excluding special items, of $1.5 billion and a pre-tax margin of 13.5%. Our earnings per share, excluding special items, were $1.92, which is up 8.5% versus 2016. We're particularly pleased with the revenue performance in the quarter. Our unit revenues increased 5.7%, which is evidence that the long-term investments we're making at American, in our product and in our team are working.","In the second quarter, we continued the most aggressive fleet modernization program in commercial aviation history. As we took delivery of 20 new aircraft to replace older aircraft in the fleet, we expanded our Basic Economy and Premium Economy products allowing us to offer more choices to our customers. And we're introducing new technologies to make it even easier for our customers to fly American, like proactive bag notification and auto re-accommodation tools.","These long-term product investments are examples of how we're working to validate the trust that's placed in us by customers when they choose American and by all of you when you invest in American.","We believe that building this trust starts first with our own team. We need an engaged and enthusiastic team if we want to be the best airline in the world. Early in the quarter, we gave unprecedented mid-contract increases in base pay to our pilots and flight attendants. And we continue to make other significant investments in areas such as customer service, training and team member empowerment. And we are working hard to finalize a joint contract with our ramp and mechanic team members.","We're running American for the long haul. And we're extremely bullish about the future prospects for our team members, our customers and our investors. Today's results provide validation we're on the right course and we are even more excited about what lies ahead.","So, we want to thank and congratulate our 120,000 team members who are the ones responsible for these strong results and the key to our future.","Derek is going to give you more color on the financials, and then Robert will tell you more about the great work our team is doing, and also about some of the exciting revenue opportunities we have ahead of us. Derek?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. I'd also like to thank more than 120,000 team members for everything they do each and every day. As a result of the outstanding job they do looking after our customers, we had another very successful quarter. As Doug mentioned, we filed our earnings press release and 10-Q this morning. In that release, our second quarter 2017 GAAP net profit was $803 million or $1.63 per diluted share. This compares to our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. Excluding special items, we reported a net profit of $944 million in the second quarter of 2017 versus our third quarter 2016 net profit of $1 billion.","Our diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $1.92 per share, up 8.5% year-over-year versus $1.77 per diluted share in the second quarter 2016. This growth reflects the impact of our share repurchase program, which resulted in a 12.9% year-over-year reduction in our weighted average diluted share count. Our GAAP second quarter 2017 pre-tax profit was $1.3 billion. Excluding net special items, our second quarter pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 13.5%.","Turning to revenue, our total second quarter operating revenues were up 7.2% year-over-year to $11.1 billion. Passenger revenues were $9.6 billion, up 6.5% on yield improvement of 4.3%. Cargo revenues were up 13.1% to $196 million due primarily to higher volume. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 11.1% year-over-year, due primarily to revenues associated with our new co-branded credit card agreements that we signed in the third quarter of 2016. Robert will give more detail on our revenue performance during his remarks.","Total GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2017 were $9.6 billion, up 11.1% versus the same period last year. This increase was due primarily to a 12.5% or $333 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a result of the mid-contract pay increases that Doug talked about, as well as rate increases for our ramp and mechanic team members which became effective in the middle of the third quarter of last year. Higher year-over-year fuel costs also contributed to this increase.","The second quarter CASM, cost per ASM, was $0.1334, up 9.6% year-over-year. Excluding fuel and special items, our consolidated CASM was $0.1049, up 6.8% year-over-year, due primarily to the salary and benefit increases, selling expenses due to higher revenues and aircraft-related depreciation expense. We ended the quarter with approximately $9.3 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of cash and investments of $6.9 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had a restricted cash position of $554 million. In July, our restricted cash was reduced to $490 million due to a reduction in our workers' compensation collateral requirements.","During the quarter, our treasury team raised $645 million in proceeds to finance 11 aircraft through private mortgages and sale-leaseback transactions. We also completed repricing on our $735 million facility secured by our London Heathrow franchise at a rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. In April, the company made a $279 million contribution to its pension plans, which was $254 million in excess of the $25 million required cash contribution in 2017. And, as a result, all of our pension plans continue to be fully funded under the Airline Relief Act.","In the second quarter of 2017, the company returned $500 million to its shareholders including quarterly dividend payments totaling $50 million and repurchase of $450 million of common stock, or 10 million shares. Our share count has dropped by 35% from 756 million at merger close in December 2013 to 488 million shares as of June 30.","In addition to our earnings release, we also filed our investor update this morning. Consistent with our previous guidance, in the third quarter of 2017, we expect our system ASM growth to be up approximately 2.7%. For the full year, we continue to expect consolidated system capacity to be up approximately 1.5%, driven by gauge up approximately 2.5% and stage length up approximately 1%, offset by 2% fewer departures.","We expect domestic consolidated capacity to be approximately flat year-over-year and international capacity to be up approximately 4%, primarily due to the continuing impact of the 777-200 retrofit program and the year-over-year impact of new Pacific markets that were added in 2016. We continue to expect the rate of CASM growth to decelerate throughout the remainder of the year. We expect our third quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel and special items, to be up approximately 4.5%, with mainline up approximately 5% and regional up approximately 2%. Our fourth quarter consolidated CASM expected to be up approximately 3%.","We are forecasting fuel prices to be up approximately 8% in the third quarter, based on the forward curve as of July 24, 2017. On a consolidated basis, we expect to pay between $1.57 and $1.62 per gallon which is slightly higher than our previous guidance. Using the midpoint of guidance we provided, we expect our third-quarter 2017 pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 10% and 12%.","Our annual CapEx assumptions remain unchanged as we continue with our fleet renewal program, for the full year, we expect gross aircraft CapEx to total $4.1 billion, which includes the delivery of 57 mainline aircraft and 16 regional aircraft. In addition, we expect to invest $1.6 billion in non-aircraft CapEx for integration work and projects to improve our product and operations. Notable product investments completed in the quarter include new Admirals Clubs opening in Houston and Toronto, a major refurbishment of our JFK lounge and the induction of our last 777-200 for retrofit. We now will have lie-flat seats on all 777 fleet.","In conclusion, our team produced outstanding results in the second quarter and we look forward to continuing in this trend. This is a busy time of the year for our more than 120,000 team members and I would like to thank them once again for all they do to continue the success of American Airlines.","With that, I will turn it over to Robert.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd also like to begin my remarks by thanking our 120,000 team members for the strong second quarter results. Without them, none of this would have been possible.","Over the past several earnings calls, we have talked a lot about the many commercial and operational initiatives to improve the overall experience at American, and it's rewarding to see many of these projects come to fruition as they move from planning phase to implementation. We successfully launched Basic Economy and our new Premium Economy cabin is also performing well. We also continue to make important long-term investments in things like customer service training, facilities improvements for both our employees and customers, and technology investments to improve the overall customer experience. In addition, we just launched phase 1 of our dynamic re-accommodation and proactive bag notification self-service applications. And those will be followed by other customer self-service tools that will provide improved capabilities for our customers.","Airport experience is also becoming more customer-centric with our new flagship experiences, as well as new and refreshed Admirals Clubs across the system. The first flagship dining (sic) [Flagship First Dining] location debuted at JFK on May 25 generating significant media interest and praise from the traveling community. American is leading the way in premium travel experience, and the great news is that there's more to come as we expand our updated flagship lounges and new Flagship First Dining experience to other key international gateways over the next 18 months. All of these investments are beginning to bear fruit and we're very excited about the opportunities ahead.","Our operational performance continues to gain momentum as we make progress relative to our domestic peers in each of the core operating metrics. One notable area where we continue to close the competitive gap is in our mishandled baggage, MBR performance which improved 17.4% year-over-year based on DOT-reported data. The extraordinary effort of our frontline team members to drive this sustained improvement is remarkable and it's encouraging to see investments in new technology, operation centers and new ground service equipment producing intended results.","We expanded our new Basic Economy product into 78 markets in the U.S. and Canada. The early results continue to be in line with our expectations with approximately half of the customers given an option to buy up to the Main Cabin, choosing to do so. We expect to roll out Basic Economy across our domestic network by the end of September. In addition, we're very pleased with the customer adoption of our new Premium Economy product, which has an average upsell rate of more than $400. These seats are now being installed on our 777-200 aircraft, and we expect to have most of our other widebody aircraft retrofitted with this highly differentiated seating choice for international customers by the end of 2018.","Turning to revenue, the overall environment remains robust and we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Our second quarter consolidated PRASM was up 5% and our second quarter TRASM was up 5.7%. Our significant investments in our people, product, and new corporate sales initiatives are paying off, and when coupled with our new revenue management tools, changes to our AAdvantage program, and our new mobile platform, the results have been impressive.","In domestic, our consolidated PRASM was up 5.7%. We saw strength across the board with Philadelphia and Miami leading the way with double digit increases. We continue to implement a number of revenue management initiatives for the Premium cabin and these are proving to be very effective. Our sales initiatives with our high-value channels are also gaining momentum as we continued to see strong performance with gains in corporate share, share gap and average ticket values.","Our Latin America performance, overall, was very strong with PRASM up 15.1%. Positive Latin PRASM was driven by a strong performance in all entities, an improved trend from the first quarter of 2017 where only South America had positive year-over-year PRASM performance. We expect positive Latin year-over-year PRASM performance for the remainder of 2017. Atlantic PRASM was flat year-over-year, but more than 5 percentage point improvement from the first quarter's year-over-year performance. Premium cabin pricing and yield management initiatives, improved share performance with travel management companies and easing comps from past year events will continue to contribute to 2017 year-over-year PRASM performance.","The UK is showing the largest PRASM improvement on a year-over-year basis due to improved Premium cabin performance. However, the overall environment remains challenged as low-priced carriers grow substantially resulting in a weaker pricing environment for coach travel. Across the Pacific, PRASM was positive for the second quarter, a sign that we are turning the corner on our capacity buildout for the Pacific. Both Japan and Australasia had strong year-over-year performance. Second-quarter cargo revenue improved 13.1% year-over-year on strong volume growth, continuing a trend we've seen since the latter half of 2016.","As we look forward to the third quarter, we do face difficult year-over-year comparisons that uniquely impact American. In the third quarter 2016, we benefited from competitive pricing actions, IT disruptions at one of our competitors and the Olympics. That said, we still expect positive unit growth in the third quarter. Regionally, our domestic PRASM is expected to be positive for the quarter in spite of some unique events that benefited last year. We think Latin America will again be our best-performing entity with performance in line with the first quarter. The Atlantic is expected to be flat and the Pacific in line with the second quarter.","Looking forward, we continue to be excited about our operational commercial investments and the value that we expect them to create. While our year-over-year comparisons do get more challenging as we lap the impact of our new credit card deal, the start of a stronger revenue environment in South America and some unique events last year, we expect our third quarter TRASM to be up approximately 0.5% to 2.5% year-over-year. Although this is lower sequentially than second quarter, this has more to do with 2016 than any trend for 2017.","Our comps for the second quarter were comparatively easy while the comps for the third quarter were comparatively hard for the reasons I've stated. The best way to view this is to look at the year over two year comparisons. When viewed through this lens, the second quarter and third quarter unit revenue change is almost identical and thus, we feel very good about our second quarter revenue performance and similarly good about our third quarter performance. And we also expect that our fourth quarter unit revenue performance will be better than our third quarter estimate. While we have a lot of work left to do, we are encouraged by what we have achieved so far and we look forward to the future.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And we will take our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Doug, given your two-year capacity view as well as your view on just sort of technology in general, by the end of 2018, do you expect to have greater, fewer or the same number of employees as today?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I don't know, Jamie. I think we will be growing over that time. So I would expect we would have more people, but again, we'll see as we move forward and it's not something we \u2013 that's not a number we project.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Also, can you tell us what percentage of the fourth quarter revenue is already on the books and what gives you the confidence in the fourth quarter RASM guide that you've delivered exceeding the growth rate of the third quarter and then it implies a rate of sequential improvement that's \u2013 I think it's better than anything you've witnessed since the close of the merger. So just wondering what the contributing factors are to the confidence there.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","There's not much on the books, as you know, for the fourth quarter. It's more of what we see on a year-over-year basis versus 2016. (20:48) the third quarter is particularly a difficult comp, and the fourth quarter is less difficult. So if things stay the same, we expect we will see more improvement in the fourth quarter than we expect to see in the third quarter.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Doug or Robert, you guys have guided to a $1 billion potential benefit from cabin segmentation. I believe that was a number that Scott used to talk about. Do you still think that's a good number? And can you give us a sense of how much of that you might expect to come through in 2018?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We do think it's a solid number, and we're making great progress. As I said, Basic Economy is going to be rolled out throughout our domestic system by September, and our Premium Economy product is really dependent on how fast we retrofit our fleets. We should have that done by the end of 2018, and as we look past 2018 that should be in our numbers.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. This is Derek. I would \u2013 yeah, go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","I'm sorry. Go ahead, Derek.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No, I was going to say that the big piece of that is Basic Economy, and as Robert said, we'll have that all rolled out by the end of the year. So that should be all reflected in the 2018 numbers. Premium is the one that's going to take a little bit longer to be put in as we change the aircraft over.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess United initially rolled out its Basic Economy product all the way up and down the fare ladder while I think Delta's was only at the bottom three rungs, and as I understand it your Basic Economy product looks more like Delta's than it does United's. If the primary objective of Basic Economy is to segment the market in such a way as to compete with the ultra-low-cost carriers without diluting the Premium fare from the late booking business traveler, then don't you need to offer Basic Economy all the way up to zero-day APE (22:58)? And assuming that's correct, does your Basic Economy product as you've structured it today prevent you from being able to do that?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay, this is Don Casey. When we roll out our entire product, you'll see exactly how we think the appropriate way to structure the products, so we're not going to disclose exactly how we're going to implement it. So I think it's a bit too soon to judge exactly what our plan is.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks, Don.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, Doug. I want to follow up on Jamie's second question because I think it's important, and I would kind of appreciate a little more thorough answer. I think the market would, too. On the 4Q commentary, if you don't want to give a number in terms of percentage bookings that's fine, but I think we should really get a sense for how you feel so comfortable about that. I think there's a lot of sloppiness and volatility in the close-in pricing which you alluded to. I just don't want this to become an overhang on the stock for the next five months, so like how can we be sure that you feel good about that hitting that number? I would imagine that you see like a pretty substantial gap between 4Q and 3Q to even put that out there. So what gives you the confidence, just one more time, to say that that's going to be better?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Same thing again. People don't book that far in advance, as you guys all know. So I don't know. Don, what do we have \u2013 percentage bookings on the...","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","14%.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","About 15% bookings. So that 15%, for what it's worth, gives us some confidence, but it's only 15%. So that is not the source of the confidence. The point we're trying to make is our third quarter comp was particularly hard. Our fourth quarter comp looks less hard. Based on what we're seeing today, if the demand environment stays where it is today, we expect the fourth quarter increase will be greater than the third quarter. It's maybe about 16% to 17%. It's about 17%, staying where it is.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks. And then on distribution, you had the distribution summit last month, I guess it was, can you talk about for a second what kind of feedback you've gotten from the TMCs around the direct connect concept since that conference, and how much of that is driving your expectation of corporate share gains? And can you help people understand what you're trying to do that's different than the industry in terms of sort of tailoring I guess specific products to specific corporations? And how you bank on that driving share gains? Thanks.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","This is Don, again. First of all, our NDC strategy is a long-term strategy, right. It's not a short-term strategy. And so we don't really expect anything we are doing right now in NDC to have any impact on the corporate share performance. Having said that, we're getting a lot of momentum in corporate share performance for all the other things that we're doing. Our focus in our NDC initiative is to provide kind of tailored unbundled products to corporations that are going to be integrated into the booking systems that they use to manage travel, and that's going to be a value-added proposition to our corporate customers. But it's a long-term strategy, not a short-term strategy.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, Don. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Derek, I know you've put out a goal of, I think, some 2% CASMex growth in 2018 and beyond. How do you think about your pre-tax margins in that context, assuming sort of the historical correlation of fuel with fares? Do you think you could ever get back to a level somewhere in between 2015 and 2016 pre-tax margins or is that sort of too aggressive right now?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No. I mean, as you said, it depends on where fuel goes and where things are, but I think in an environment where we are at today, I think we can have margins that are above where we are at in 2017. CASM growth stays in the 2% range. We have a lot of initiatives that we've talked about that signal to us on the revenue side where we would have revenue growth higher than that that would produce margins that are comparable to those times in 2015-2016 timeframe. So, I think the margin growth is there over the next few years, and we've talked about our $5 billion number and we believe that that's where we can be from a pre-tax income perspective, up and down \u2013 ranged around $5 billion over the last few years, so we're very confident with that.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And I guess just to follow up a little bit on Hunter's follow up to Jamie, obviously, another airline spoke of some weaker domestic pricing out there in the market yesterday. So with your 4Q comments, it seems like you're not seeing this weakness spillover into your markets. Can you maybe talk about what you are seeing within the domestic pricing environment right now?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","This is Don again. I mean, what we are really observing is just carriers are matching other carriers' prices. In our case, for anybody flying into our hubs, we have been matching their fares since the middle of 2015. So from a competitive perspective, nothing has changed for us. And in fact, we're quite excited about rolling out Basic Economy because that is the tool we've been waiting for to put in place in the fourth quarter of this year. That's going to allow us to continue what we are already doing, which is matching the fares of anybody that flies in and out of our hubs. But it's also going to give us the opportunity to generate more ancillary revenue and generate more upsell to the product that we offer to customers today.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks. Look, you guys have done a really nice job improving your revenue trends for the last year since you made some big leadership changes late last summer, so you clearly deserve credit for that. I wanted to ask you some follow-ups on Basic Economy. Can you talk about any positive share shift you may be seeing from the fact that you don't have it yet, have you noticed any positive share pickup out of Chicago in June and July?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We've really only rolled out Basic Economy to 78 markets. We anticipate that this is going to be beneficial in the long run. And from what we can see right now, it's going to be beneficial. It's producing the results that we want. And anything that others may or may not say hasn't really shown a heck of a lot in our numbers.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","I guess the question is more in markets where you don't have it, but a competitor does. It seems like you'd be seeing some positive share shift.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We saw some, I would describe it as fairly modest share shift in close-in bookings, but based on changes that have been made to United's pricing structure, we do not expect any of this to continue into the third quarter and that the impact in the second quarter was very marginal.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And indeed as we put it in place, it will actually increase our revenue generating performance versus where we are today without having it in play.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","I appreciate that. I guess the question is doesn't inventory management still matter? And again, you deserve credit. You're clearly focused on \u2013 it seems like you care about pricing, but if an airline puts out garbage walk-up fares at Basic Economy and then adds $20 to it and calls it Main Cabin, isn't Main Cabin fare just a garbage walk-up fare plus $20?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","If somebody flies into our hub, right? We are going to match their fares, right. And that is what we are going to go do. I mean, we do sell out, right? So we did do yield management in all of these markets and we sell out of the EOCC (31:44) pricing structure a very high percentage of the time, but that's all based on individual market, but we do yield manage. We yield manage up out of those pricing structures as demand warrants, but we will, with our basic product, match whoever flies in and out of our hubs.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Just sort of going back to the fourth quarter expectation that you outlined in the press release and some of the comments there, I guess thinking about having Basic Economy fully rolled out by the end of September, could you maybe comment on how accretive do you think that could be to the fourth quarter RASM number? Because I think that maybe is part of the optimism that you're sharing today.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","I'm not going to give you a number because once we roll it out, we're going to have to figure out what the right price points are and kind of how it settles out in the marketplace. So, we don't have a specific number that we're going to add into the fourth quarter. We've had a number of initiatives, right, that we've had all year that we've seen the benefits to. As Doug mentioned, 2017 is (33:05) more of a 2016 than 2017. And we expect all of the improvement we've seen through the first two quarters, right, to continue in the fourth quarter because of the initiatives that continue into the fourth quarter.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Don, thank you for that. And just to stay with you for a moment, if you could maybe just expand on the comments earlier just from a geographic perspective, just curious the trends that you're seeing in Asia, other carriers have commented on continued deterioration as they move through the second quarter and into the third quarter in Asia. What are you seeing there? Are you seeing the same thing? And then in Europe the comments, I think, were generally positive in the prepared remarks. Now that we're getting more towards the shoulder season of U.S. travel, would you continue to expect to see the same type of positive trends, I think, which have surprise to the upside in Europe thus far this year?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Let me just start with the Pacific. I mean, our situation in the Pacific is a little bit different, right. So in the Pacific for us, okay, we've rolled out a lot of new service. We started four new services from Los Angeles last year. We're going to lap the fourth of those new services in September, Los Angeles-Hong Kong. So from our situation, okay, we're now just kind of growing into the capacity that we had out there.","In addition to that, we've improved our premium product in the Pacific. We didn't get to a full lie-flat product until February of this year. We're seeing very strong demand for our premium product in the Pacific. So, the combination of kind of lapping all of our new service and growing into that capacity as well as the improvements that we've made in the premium product may be changing our profile compared to others, but the Pacific, again, we've had a couple of positive quarters and the third quarter looks very similar to us.","As far as Atlantic goes, Atlantic is challenging. The fundamentals are challenging. There is excess capacity in the marketplace. The capacity is being driven by low-price carriers. What's offsetting this for us is, again, strong Premium cabin performance, again partly because premium market is strong but plus we believe we now have the industry-leading premium product on the transatlantic and we're seeing very strong demand for that product. We're seeing strength in U.S. point-of-sale demand which is also important for us. And last year we had relatively low load factors, so we're able to increase load factors. So strong Premium cabin performance combined with load factor gains, it really offset what is a really weak coach pricing environment.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks again for the time.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. If I could dig a little bit more on the corporate share comments, could you provide any color on the progress there? And even to the extent that I appreciate the Premium Economy comments about when that gets rolled out, but are all your international fleet \u2013 is that now have free lie-flat on a very competitive product? And are you gaining share from that aspect as well?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Don can help me out here, but we're definitely seeing share gains from our product on all fronts. And again, that's in place this summer for the first time, so adding to strength, and as we look to Premium Economy, it's just on a limited number of aircraft right now \u2013 just ten aircraft. By the end of the year, it'll be 63 aircraft, and I think in the first quarter...","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","77.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","77 \u2013 end of first quarter of 2018, 77. But we do anticipate that that strength will continue to hold as well.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","I'll just say, on the corporate front, this is the third in a row where we've seen both gains in our share and also our share gap in the corporate market. We've also seen stronger yields, so average ticket values are up. We've seen particular strength this quarter in professional services, industrials and in financials, so again, we're very pleased with our performance in corporate.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you. And then if I may follow up as one more way to kind of crack the 4Q issue here, just looking on a two year-over-year basis that you mentioned for looking at 2Q and 3Q, if I look at 4Q it seems like a tougher comp just on two year-over-year basis, which is why I'm kind of curious is, is the difference between like 3Q and 4Q, is that kind of the Brazil Olympics and the fact that you gained from some of the technology outages last year? And so that's not having those pressures in 4Q is what really drives that outlook? Because if I look at it on two-year basis, it doesn't seem to have an easier comp.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay. Let me take that. Again, we've been improving our sequential performance now for six straight quarters, and so once you go over one quarter, the comps do get harder. But we had some specific things related to this quarter that put us off trend line that were baked into 2016 last year. You've identified a number of them. The other big issue we had last year was there was a lot of disruptive pricing action in the marketplace last year, in the third quarter. We ended up with actually a price advantage for a period of time which helped us materially in the third quarter last year. Again, we look at the trend line, we look at the initiatives we have and the traction they have, and with Basic Economy rolling out in the fourth quarter, we see an improvement over the third quarter.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you, operator. Hi, team. Thank you very much for the time.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi, Helane.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. I would like to ask an unrelated question. I think you guys have talked about something like $2 billion to $2.5 billion in revenue opportunity over the next few years that you see from some of the things that you're doing, and I'm just kind of wondering one of the things you needed was obviously buy-in from labor and \u2013 so I wanted to know, have you seen significant improvement in their on-time performance and their participation and their buy-in to your plans since the labor agreements went into place?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, Helane, I'll tell you this. I think our team has always been behind us, and from our perspective, we want to make sure that we're supporting them in the ways that we need to and we can so that they can do their jobs that they want to do even better. And that's what we see. We see people that really can make use of new tools, new technology, and support from the leadership team.","And so I'm pleased with where we're headed. We have buy-in, people get excited about new aircraft, people get excited about new product in terms of seats, they get excited about lounges and flagship dining. And as we take a look forward, as you noted, we have a lot of confidence in the revenue initiatives that we have coming forward. And some of those are finishing off reconfiguration programs and looking at even some others. And it's finishing off product launches that from basic and premium that we think are really going to pay off.","So all-in-all, we're optimistic and very pleased with the support we have from the team, and that's only going to grow as we get stronger.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much for that. And then just one other question on IT investment. As we look forward and think about your investment in the products that you are doing, but also what \u2013 and I know I think I asked this question last time as well \u2013 what about back-office in ensuring that cyber-attacks and IT outages and other things don't impact you? Can you just talk a little bit maybe about the redundancies in your systems, and how you are ensuring \u2013 because I think I saw also you're going to the cloud, IBM cloud, right, services for some of your system? So I'm kind of wondering how that all ties together if you could talk a little bit about that.","Maya Leibman - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. This is Maya, and I'll take that question. When we think about our technology investments, they fall into a few different camps, and one of those camps is what we call ensuring the reliability and stability of our systems, because we know how disruptive that can be to our customers and to our employees. So we will always have a big chunk of investment focused on things like improving our disaster recovery capabilities, making sure that we are replacing systems and components that are end of service life, and certainly protecting us against cyber-related initiatives. So big chunk of investment is focused on that and that will always be the case going forward.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, I appreciate all that insight","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","We will take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for getting me on the call. I guess I want to come back to Helane's question because I feel like on the last earnings call, Wall Street was taking a pretty shortsighted view on the pay increases. So, I don't know, can we revisit the philosophy here on pay and how you encompass that into closing the margin gap? We know where Delta's guidance is for next quarter, and that was quite an issue for your competitor last week. So I guess, Doug, can you just talk about how you can get to better profitability long-term, and how that pay philosophy works into that outlook?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes, look we are not particularly concerned about how we measure our success versus others. What we care about is making sure we're doing everything we can to make American everything it can be, and to do that it's important to us that our team is properly engaged and that includes compensation. So we \u2013 it has been a long history here at American of labor discord that we are working hard to overcome, and that includes working really hard to rebuild trust with some people that lost trust over lot of times.","So what that means to us is we need to make sure our team understands that we're here to support them. They know exactly what to do and how to do it. Our job is to make sure they have all the tools and products they need to go take care of customers and really do so well. And we're doing all that, as Robert described.","But it also means that we'll live up to the commitment we made when we did this merger, which is we're going to \u2013 if we have an airline that has the revenue generating capabilities of other airlines, we need to be able to pay our people as other airlines do. Because of the way those two contracts have transpired, we've gotten to a point that in those two cases our team was going to be working for less than their peers at other airlines for a few years. That didn't seem right to us. So we addressed it. And we made that commitment to the rest of the team. If we find that in the future that we have \u2013 their peers that are doing the same job that they do at other airlines but not doing as well as they do, they should know that the company is going to address that, as we should.","So we feel really good about that commitment, and it's one that is going to help us move forward. My own view is all the things we talked about in terms of product enhancements that we're doing and all the capital investments we're making are going to be sub-optimized if we continue to treat our team members the way they feel as though they've been treated in the past.","So the way to actually get those investments to achieve their real value is to let our team be excited and fired up about the company they work for and give them an environment that they know cares about them so that they can go take care of our customers. And that's what this is for. It's for the long-term, not the near-term. We know it's the right idea. We knew it was the right idea when we did it, and we did our best to impress that upon you on the last quarter's call and I'm certain it'll play out over time.","A decent time for me to make the point that, again, we're in this for the long term and we look at investments in the long-term and we look at this mid-contract pay increase as a long-term investment as well. And we feel good about the long-term. When we get on these calls, we spend a lot more time talking about the near-term than we do internally; that's fine. That's something that you all care about a good bit more than we do, and our job is to make sure that we address those concerns for you all.","I'll tell you, though, when we talk to our shareholders, these are the same kind of conversations we have. We talk a lot more about the long-term with our individual shareholders, and we're really pleased to see how our shareholder base has gotten to be a lot more long-term holders because I think they appreciate what we're doing at American to build for the long-term.","So anyway, it's a long way to be saying we don't just look at a world that says how is it going to affect next quarter's earnings? We look at a world that says what's it going to do the make sure that American over time produces the kind of returns for our shareholders that they deserve? And that includes making investments in the near-term that'll pay off in the long-term.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that response, Doug. And I guess as we look out over the long-term, I know you guys are going to have an analyst meeting in couple months. Maybe we'll save it for that. But is there any reason why you think your airline, your network can't be industry-leading from a return perspective or a margin perspective?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I don't know. It depends on what the others do. What I know is what we've said in the past, and again, the best evidence I can give you is the way we compensate our executives. We've built an airline that we know over time \u2013 and indeed, in the near-term time, not in the distant future \u2013 that today should be able to produce $5 billion pre-tax earnings in a normal year, $7 billion in a really good year, $3 billion in a not so good year. That's the company we have here. That's what we believe we have. That's not just a goal. That's how we build our incentive compensation plan for our team.","If we have a year where we make less than $5 billion pre-tax, our executives get less than target bonus. If we make $5 billion, they get target bonus. If make more than that, they get \u2013 and if we make less than $3 billion, they're not going to get a bonus at all. That's what we've built, and we feel really good about where we are in that regard today.","As we look to next year, we'll talk more about that as we get to earnings \u2013 as we get to our Investment Day and as we get closer to 2018. But 2018 looks like a year that we can \u2013 again, it certainly doesn't look like a year that can't be one of those target years. So we feel really good about where the company is today, what our prospects are for the future, and we're really bullish for our investors, for our team members and for our customers. The investments we've been making for the last few years are beginning to pay off already and there's a lot more ahead. So we're excited.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much. Just two questions on the card program. I'll try and get more creative next quarter. So, Derek, just on the accounting of it. Is it fair to say that the revenue from selling miles, which flows through the passenger revenue line, has costs associated with it, those costs being providing free travel or some other reward? But that the revenue from selling miles, which flows through the other revenue line, does not have much in the way of costs, negligible bag fee waivers, lounge access, that type of thing. Is that a fair characterization?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I mean, we lump it all into one. I mean, the amount that goes through the other revenue line is more the marketing driven side of things, but we lump it all into one. There's expenses for all of it to provide travel for our frequent flyers. So there is a definite cost to it. As you talk about over the past time, all we had said is that the increase in the new credit card deal that we did was more rate driven than it was volume driven. It was just an increase in the rate as we went forward and negotiated with our cardholders. So we had said that that came at not too much of a cost. But if you look at the overall program, there is costs associated with both of those dollars that come in to provide travel for our frequent fliers.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then you mentioned or quantified the average upsell on the Premium Economy side. Can you do the same on the Basic Economy side on the 50% upsell on Basic Economy, what's the average upsell?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay. This is Don, again. I think we've set the structure. These are our beta markets at $20 upsell, and $40 upsell in the close-in bookings. But as I said earlier, even though that's the upsell, the yield management system will potentially sell up from that, beyond that, right. That's just the starting point. So if we just look at the initial sell-up point, it's about $23 because most of the volume is at the $20 sell-up rate.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein Financial House (52:21).","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, guys. With the Premium Economy, can you give us a sense for what percentage of the international seats, when it's fully rolled out, will be premium versus regular economy? And whether you have any plans to expand the Premium Economy into the U.S. market as well?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I don't know if we have a number to...","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","It's 20 to 28 seats a plane.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","These are wide-body airplanes that have 250 seats, 280 seats, so.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes...","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And there's no plan right now...","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And there's...","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","...to go domestically.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","No plans domestically, yes.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And I guess as you think about maybe longer-term, the vision around the flagship experience, if we were to just, say, look out five to seven years, what do you think is going to change about the travel experience on American? Like, what's the vision about what you can do from a customer experience perspective that you think will be either special or unique or will help you, kind of, deliver a better travel experience over the next, call it, five to seven years?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, this is the start of it. So the flagship lounge and flagship dining product we have plans to expand over the next year, 1.5 year. And that's a continuation of making sure that we're meeting the needs of a premium traveler. So whether you're taking a look at the hard product on the aircraft and making sure that we have the best first- and business-class hard product in terms of seat and entertainment, whether you take a look at our product on the ground with flagship check-in or the lounges, and then in terms of how we serve our customers with technology and with our personal attention through things like the AAdvantage program.","We've got all the tools, and the great news is that there's more coming in every one of those categories. So when we take a look at the premium customer, we think that things are definitely going to be improving, and they're going to have value for the money they spend on American.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Do you envision things like agentless boarding and things like that, like more automation, kind of, hitting the ground-based operations as well? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you think this is going to shift. Do you think there's some potential there to change that experience in a meaningful way?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, yes, and Maya can help me out here, too. But, look, customers demand gratification instantly in many respects, and so we want to give them what they want and what they need, whether it's personal attention or technology to make their days easier. So the process for a customer in the airport is going to get better and better from a baggage perspective and also from a transit through the airport and onto the aircraft. And the real advantages I think for the vast majority of customers that we can provide is that when things do go wrong, or when things are disrupted, we can make things a lot better in giving options on an immediate basis.","And then, personalization is something I think that is out there. The more that we can stay connected with our customers, the more that we know what they want when they want it, and we have means to deliver it. Maya?","Maya Leibman - American Airlines Group, Inc.","(55:51).","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks for the time.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","All right, thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kevin Crissey with Citi.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Hey. Thanks a lot. Maybe one, I'm not sure if it's maybe for Don. If an airline files a fare on its website that differs from the ATPCO filing, how quickly do you see that? And how does that affect your pricing strategy, generally?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","We track every channel. And if we see prices, we will respond to price action in any channel and every channel.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So the match would be at the lower of the two fares. Is that the way you would take that?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","We will match whatever fares are in the marketplace in our hubs, wherever they are.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Maybe bigger picture, can you talk about your view on the transatlantic, the thoughts of the effectiveness of the low-cost model over time, maybe the pros and cons? I don't know that it's a proven model, but maybe you could talk about the pros and cons of the low-cost model. Obviously, you're not operating that model, but it's important because it's obviously having an impact on transatlantic leisure demand. Thank you.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. I think the best place to go to that is to the low-cost carriers. I can't really predict how well they're going to do. I can tell you, though, that we have confidence in being able to compete against them. The nature of our system and our hub-and-spoke network and the gateways that we have I think provide us with a unique opportunity to deliver a higher quality product, one that people will pay more for and with a lot of content that can't be delivered by the ULCCs. So it's going to be a competitive marketplace. We know that there's a lot of capacity coming, but we feel confident in our ability to compete, no matter what goes on with the ultra-low-cost carriers.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","And I'll just add, one of the competitive tools that we have is our current (58:03) business arrangement with IAG. And IAG has the ability to go and launch new carrier called Level. And so we are participating in this market through our partnership with IAG because the Level services are part of our joint business relationship with them.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","And at this time, we'd like to take questions from the media.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Before we do that, operator, I just wanted \u2013 before we leave the analysts, a little gratuitous commentary from me again. Look, I just want to stress again how excited we are about where American is today and where we're headed. And again, I believe that if you go and model in what we've been telling you, which this is an airline that can produce over $5 billion pre-tax profits on a normal year, and that we feel today that we're undervalued.","It feels at least to us, to me, that things like these near-term pricing issues that have been happening for the last few years feel like still part of the market that just can't believe the industry has really gotten itself well and is looking for signals that indeed we're going to default back to the industry of the past, almost like this is too good to be true. And what we've noticed over the last few years is those tend to be buying opportunities.","So that's what this feels like to us. We felt undervalued before yesterday, and we felt more undervalued when yesterday was over. So again, I would just encourage those of you that can to look at American in today as to what we produced and what we will produce going forward, not so much about what's going to happen in the next three weeks, but more about what's going to happen in the next three years.","And we feel good about both those things, by the way. We just don't think what's going to happen in the next three weeks has any impact whatsoever in our value today, because that should be based on what we're going to do in the long term and over the next few years. And we couldn't, again, be more happy, more excited and more bullish about that.","So by no means we're trying to be dismissive of your concerns about the near term. We recognize that's important to some subset of our shareholders and we'll do everything we can to answer them. But just please understand that if we don't have quite the same level of concern as you do, it's because we don't view this as importantly as some of you do because we're in this for the long game, and we're going to keep being in it for the long game. But we'll do our best to keep addressing those concerns of you that care about the short term.","All right, media.","Operator","And at this time, we will take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Good morning, Doug.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","So earlier this week, TWU was out protesting, picketing at DFW Airport and one of the things they talked about, while they didn't talk about specifics of the company proposal that was offered last week, they were making the point about outsourcing. That they want to see actually some of the work that had been outsourced under previous contracts brought back in-house. And I was wondering if I could get some comments from you and the team, about your thoughts on bringing some of the work that's currently being done by third parties back in-house?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Again, we indeed are in the middle of negotiations. The company, in an effort to bring to a close, the contract negotiation that's been going on too long, put a comprehensive proposal on the table in the last week, and we'll leave that at the table. The IAM, TWU has done a nice job of doing that too, as you note. They haven't talked about specifics of our proposal. But look, what we'll tell you on the point you raise, American does more work in-house than any other airline, and nothing in our proposal seeks to change the amount of work done by our aircraft mechanics and where it's done.","So we'll continue to work with them, but we're trying to get two contracts to come together and they have different kind of work rules and scope clause and things like that. We put a proposal to our team that results in a contract for our IAM and TWU members that is industry-leading, just like we have in every other contract we've gotten done. So we're confident we'll get that done at some point in time. We need to continue to work through it with our team and we prefer to do it with them as opposed to talking about it in public, but as it relates to outsourcing, we again, American does more in-house than any other airline and that'll be the case going forward.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Do you think you guys can come to an agreement before the end of the year?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I don't know, Andrea. Look, we'd like to. This is the one contract we still haven't gotten done. But again, not for lack of trying on either party's part. It's a very complex one. We're dealing with two separate unions that have formed a coalition alliance. Thank you. They have formed an alliance to work together. They're working together, but that's hard. They haven't worked together before. It's seven different work groups covered by this alliance, so two different unions, two different contracts, seven different work groups going through it clause-by-clause takes some time.","As you know, about a year ago we came to the conclusion that it was taking too long and that wasn't fair to our team, so we worked out an early kind of not joint agreement but an agreement with the alliance that allowed our team members to get significant pay increases and so that's happened. That's the good news is they're not far from industry-leading wages as we sit here today. So we've taken care of that part and now we've got to get this through a joint collective bargaining agreement. I know we will at some point.","If it's done by year-end or not, that's up to the negotiating parties to try and do that. We certainly are trying to do that by putting this comprehensive proposal on the table earlier this week, and we're waiting to hear back from the IAM and TWU and I suspect shortly we'll keep it at the table and hopefully hammer something out. What gives us encouragement, of course, is we've done this with every other work group. When we get done with them, our team has industry-leading contracts. That'll be the case here, so we'll keep working through it.","She's gone.","Operator","And ma'am, does that answer your question?","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Yes. Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. And we will take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi, Mary.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Hi. Good morning. Don talked earlier about an average upsell on the Basic Economy and I didn't get those figures. Can I get those again, please?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Sure. So the structure we have in our test markets is a $20 upsell and a $40 upsell closer to departure. And the average upsell rates are $23 because most of the volume is happening further from departure, because as we get closer to departure we actually sell up out of the basic structure.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Great. Great and if I can ask, hey, Doug, so I kind of hear you saying that the emphasis on RASM and other near-term numbers like that you think are misplaced in terms of valuing the company. So what would you see as a better measure? If investors want to look at something near-term, what would you rather see them look at?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","The long-term. Look again, it's up to our investors to decide how they value a company and that's their job, and they know how to do it. So I'm not trying to tell anybody how to do it. Our point is simply this, as we look to the value of American Airlines, near-term pricing changes don't have any impact at all on what we think the value of our firm is. And none of these things feel like trends in the environment, they feel like noise. They feel a little bit like things shaking out. But what I know is this, we have an airline with a hub-and-spoke network that allows us to compete against anyone in and out of our markets for the long-term.","And we feel extremely good about that, and we are making huge investments in our team, in our product such that that network will be able to compete with anyone with similar networks. And as a result, what we know is we have an airline that's going to produce results in good and bad times that are going to give really nice returns for investors, give really nice product to our customers. And give a really great place to work for our team members, and we're excited about that. So again, we're not trying to tell anyone how they should value the company, rather just noting that when prices fall in the near-term, we don't go run off and change our five-year plan.","We don't go off and tell our executives that we're going to lower our target for your incentive compensation because someone else has gone and decided they're going to have some price skirmish for a while. But those are all short-term things and we aren't supposed to make decisions for the near-term. We're supposed to make decisions for the long-term. Our team is doing a phenomenal job of doing that, and we feel we are really, really bullish on the future. And as a result, we tend to talk about those things more than the shorter term.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Thanks, Doug.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Mary.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Good morning, guys. I was hoping that you guys could talk about the decision around the Boeing 737 MAX seating arrangement, why did you consider going to 29-inch pitch for some of those seats and how did your whole experience with that, how that's going to affect how you think about density decisions in the future?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. Conor I'll try this and anyone else can chime in. That decision again was one that was released not by us, but somehow in a way that I think over state of the situation, but that's fine. I mean what we had at one point planned to do on our 737 MAXes was get three rows in the aircraft to have \u2013 would have a 29 inch pitch notably. These are new state-of-the-art slimline seats, very high in comfort, but also much thinner than the existing seat. So 29 inches feels like something bigger than that. But nonetheless that piece of information came out on its own, and when it did, we got a lot of push-back from our customers, and most notably, from our team members, who care as much as anybody in the world about having the product they need to take care of the customers.","So when we started hearing from our flight attendants and others that, gosh, really. You're going to put us in a position where we need to explain to these customers that indeed this is necessary so that we can have one more row of main cabin extra for the rest of the airplane? It was an issue that we came to the conclusion wasn't the right decision to make, and again back to those long-term point, while we could convince ourselves that that might be able to produce somewhat higher revenues on the aircraft, what it was doing to our perception with our team wasn't worth it. So we decided to go back to 30 inches for those three rows, and again, 30 inches on a slimline seat which will feel more like 31 or 32 inches, and to go with one less row of main cabin extra.","It wasn't a hard decision for us, frankly. It was a decision that had been made in a different environment, and as we announced it, it was about to happen. When we got pushback from the team, we agreed with them. Rob?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No. Doug, the only thing I'd add is, it was never about more or less seats on the aircraft. It really is just one row of main cabin extra that was allowed that has just been converted back to a row of normal economy to produce the 30 inches. So it's a balance that we've got to constantly take a look at, and I think in this case we took feedback from all the right parties and made the right long term decision.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Conor.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Susan.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Two little questions. First of all, on your China Southern investments, the $200 million, I assume that's a done deal now. And I wondered what percentage of China Southern you own as a result of that investment? That's number one.","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi, Susan. It's Steve. We actually haven't closed the transaction yet. We're waiting for some final government approvals related to the slot exchange. We expect to get those, I was going to say this month, but in early August and can close the transaction then. And I actually haven't done the calculation, but it's sort of 3%-ish of China Southern.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Okay. I'm asking obviously because I'm wondering, given the airline casino that opened yesterday among Delta, Air France, VA and China Eastern, whether, a), you have an opinion about that transaction just from afar? And secondly, are you kind of motivated? Or have you thought about investing in your partners in the same manner?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Susan, it's Doug. We are very happy with our partners and the partners we have in place, particularly those that we either have joint ventures with or are working to get joint ventures with. We always look at ways we can strengthen the partnership. That may make sense over time. To date, it hasn't made sense for American with any of our partners except China Southern where indeed we needed to help a new partner appreciate that we were in this for the long term. But the rest of our partners, one, they're on pretty sound financial footing and aren't coming to us looking for investments, and two, already have really long term commitments with each other.","So, again, not to opine on what others are doing. I'm sure they have reasons that I'm sure make sense, but my guess is the basis for those reasons is ensuring that you have long term partnerships where everyone is equally committed. We feel that way already, but as we move forward that may or may not be something that makes sense for us and our partners. But really happy right now with the partnerships we have and the long term commitment to each other.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Koenig with Associated Press.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Hello. Susan asked my question. Let me pivot then to kind of a Washington question. There's been no visible action yet on your complaint against the Gulf carriers, and the Senate looks like it's not going to go along with privatizing air traffic control. And they're raising the PFC which is going to mean higher prices for your customers. And I'm wondering, how do you think Washington is doing on your issues? And are you concerned that your agenda is not going to get enough attention because of all the chaos and other issues that are going on there?","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","This is Steve again. We aren't concerned. I mean let's face it, there's a lot going on in Washington, and there's a lot of drama. And we have tough issues, issues for which there's some real opposition, and it's not really a great environment in Washington in July of 2017 to have the kind of discussions that we need to have to really get these issues focused on and across the finish line. I mean, we're all looking forward to everybody being able to escape Washington for the August recess and have some time to get away from the drama. That'll be an opportunity to have some really good discussions about issues and hopefully we'll be able to reset and focus on other things in September and October and be able to move these issues forward.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay. Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thank you all very much for your interest.

Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operation Instructions]","And now, we would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior VP of Revenue Management.","Like we normally do, we're going to start the call with Doug and he will provide us an overview of our first quarter 2017 results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment and then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions and, lastly, questions from the media.","But before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning revenue, our future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website at aa.com. A webcast of this call will be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us, and at this point, we'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks a lot, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. This morning, we reported our pre-tax earnings excluding special items of $491 million. We are extremely excited about the near and long-term prospects for American Airlines and our shareholders. We are in the midst of transforming American through investments in our product and our team and it is working. Our unit revenues are increasing at a faster rate than our competition and the outlook is strong. Robert will talk more about that in a minute. Before that, I just want to talk a little bit about an initiative we put in place last night.","Many of you have heard us talk about the mission at American, which is to validate the trust that is placed in us. That is a trust our customers place in us and when they choose American for their travel, and it's a trust all of you put in us when you select American as an investment choice. And at American, building trust for us starts first with our own team. We announced yesterday something that impacts our expenses, but it's also a very important step as we rebuild trust at American with our team.","The announcement yesterday was that we would make mid-contract pay increases for our pilot and flight attendant groups. It's an unprecedented move because those two groups have close to two years left on their existing contracts and to the best of our knowledge, something like this has never been done in our industry. And so therefore, it's a move that might surprise or even dismay some of you because it adds costs to the airline. We couldn't be more convicted about doing it and here's why. When we merged, we knew we were creating not only the largest airline in the world, but we set out to build the best. And that's best defined by a global network, a best-in-class product and an engaged and enthusiastic team.","With our industry profoundly changed, we made a commitment when we merged, the new American would have pay rates for our team that were at or near the top of our competitor's pay rates. And I'm happy to report that we've lived up to that commitment in every joint contract we negotiated thus far.","Also, the reason last fall, in spite of not having reached an agreement for our mechanics and fleet service workers, we moved their pay rates to industry leading rates in an unprecedented move as those contract negotiations have continued. But it's the right move for the new American. So we're going to keep leading this way because it's the right way to lead any service organization and certainly the right way to lead American Airlines. There's a history at American that's bred some mistrust, and we're working hard to change that culture, and the team is making great progress in that regard. We recognize pay alone won't build trust, but we also know it's an important step in the right direction.","As outlined in our 8-K last night, the expense add is about $350 million annually for something less than two years \u2013 I'm sorry, less than \u2013 a little over two years, as our contracts were amendable at the end of 2019 and early 2020. That's certainly a lot of money of our shareholders but in the bigger picture and taking the longer view, as a service organization, investments in our team are investments in our product. And the leverage at American today is in closing our unit revenue gap, and we believe this is an investment that will help us do that and therefore help our shareholders.","We think it's precisely this kind of investment in our people is going to make the difference in our service, and while this won't happen overnight, we also think it's the kind of investment that will continue to drive revenue outperformance for American. And as that happens, all of you will be the beneficiaries of those returns.","So in closing, we're tightening the revenue gap quickly, and our investments to accomplish this are going to continue. Because we work for all of you, you can be assured we're using your money to create an airline for the long-term. We couldn't be more excited about our prospects.","And now, I'll turn it to Derek for the financials and then Robert will talk more specifically about how we're doing in the operation and in our revenue progress. Derek?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our 120,000 team members who continue to do an exceptional job of taking care of our customers. Because of their hard work, our integration efforts and financial performance have been outstanding. As Doug mentioned, we filed our earnings press release this morning. In that release, our first quarter 2017 GAAP net profit was $234 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. This compares to our first quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $700 million or $1.14 per diluted share. Excluding special items, we reported a net profit of $308 million in the first quarter 2017, or $0.61 per share versus first quarter 2016 net profit of $765 million or $1.25 per diluted share.","The significant year-over-year decline in earnings is due primarily to a 37.8% or $472 million increase in first quarter 2017 consolidated fuel expense. Our GAAP first quarter 2017 pre-tax profit was $365 million. Excluding net special items, our first quarter pre-tax profit was $491 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 5.1%.","Our revenue performance continued to improve in the first quarter 2017 as total operating revenues were up 2% year-over-year to $9.6 billion. Passenger revenues were $8.2 billion, up 0.8% on a yield improvement of 2.4%. This marks the third consecutive quarter that our unit revenue performance has been the best of the six largest U.S. carriers. Robert will give more detail on our revenue performance later on the call after I'm done. Cargo revenues were up 6.3% to $172 million due primarily to higher volume.","Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 9.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to revenue associated with our new credit \u2013 co-branded credit card agreements. Total GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $9 billion, up 11.4% versus the same period last year due primarily to higher fuel prices and salaries and benefit expense resulting from the investment in our team. Had our first quarter 2017 fuel prices been flat to last year's $1.21 per gallon, our consolidated fuel expense would have been approximately $500 million lower.","First quarter CASM was $0.1402, up 12.6% year-over-year. Excluding fuel and special items, our consolidated CASM was $0.1116, or up 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to salaries and benefits, increases provided to our team members, which is about worth three points, higher depreciation and amortization resulting from increased CapEx in our aircraft \u2013 new aircraft, about a point, and maintenance timing of about a point.","We ended the quarter with approximately $9.1 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of cash and investments of $6.7 billion and $2.4 billion of an undrawn revolver capacity. The company also has restricted cash position of $543 million.","During the quarter, our treasury team raised $983 million to finance 24 aircraft deliveries at a fixed rate blended cost of 3.93%. We also re-priced $1.8 billion term loan at an industry leading rate of LIBOR plus 200 [bps]. In addition, we also closed two private mortgage transactions to finance four more aircraft.","In the first quarter of 2017, the company returned $563 million to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments totaling $51 million and the repurchase of $512 million of common stock or 11.7 million shares. Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee share distributions and equity awards and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped by over a third from 500 \u2013 excuse me, 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 495.7 million shares as of March 31. The company did declare a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on May 30, 2017, to stockholders of record as of May 16, 2017.","In April, we also made a $279 million contribution to the company's defined benefit plans, of which only $25 million was required, which are now fully \u2013 the plans are now fully funded as of April 17, 2017 under the Airline Relief Act. In addition to our earnings release, we also filed our investor update this morning. Consistent with our previous guidance in the second quarter of 2017, we expect our system-wide ASM growth to be up approximately 1.5%.","For the full year, we expect consolidated system capacity to be up approximately 1.5% and domestic consolidated capacity to be up approximately flat year-over-year. We expect international capacity to be up approximately 4%, primarily due to the continuing impact of the 777-200 retrofit program and the year-over-year impact of new Pacific markets that we added in 2016.","Over the past two years, we have made significant investment in our people, our product and our operation. And as Doug discussed in his remark, we are offering mid-year contract, hourly base pay rate adjustments of approximately 5% to our flight attendants and an average of 8% to our pilots. The estimated pre-tax income on the company's 2017 salary and benefits expense would be approximately $230 million in 2017 and $350 million in 2018 and 2019. So those are numbers that come off the base that we are at today. So the total impact is $350 million.","We are happy to be able to fulfill the commitment we made to our team members and continue to believe these investments are vital to improving our product and operation. With these pay rate adjustments, we now expect our second quarter of 2017 year-over-year consolidated CASM, excluding special items to be up approximately 7%. The mainline is in the range of 6% to 8%, and the regional is in the 3% to 5% range.","We continue to expect higher year-over-year fuel prices in 2017, based on the forward curve as of April 24. We expect to pay between $1.63 and $1.68 per gallon consolidated in the second quarter of 2017, which is approximately 16% higher year-over-year. Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided along with Robert's revenue guidance, we expect our second quarter 2017 pre-tax margin, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 13%.","For the full year, we expect gross aircraft CapEx to total $4.1 billion. This includes the delivery of 57 mainline aircraft and 16 regional aircraft, while retiring 46 mainline aircraft and reducing the overall regional fleet count by 9 aircraft. In addition, we expect to invest $1.6 billion in non-aircraft CapEx, which includes projects to improve our product and operations, as well as investments to complete our integration.","With respect to our fleet, we announced in our release this morning that we reached a new amended agreement with Airbus to defer delivery of the 22 A350 XWB aircraft the company has on order. Under the new amended delivery schedule, we expect to take delivery of the first two A350 aircraft in late 2020 instead of 2018, as previously expected. We now expect to take delivery of these A350s from 2020 through 2024 with an average deferral of 24 months.","In addition, we also reached agreement with Boeing to defer the delivery of two 787-9 aircraft from the second quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. These changes, as well as the impact of changes to net pre-delivery payments, reduced the company's planned capital expenditures by approximately $500 million in 2018 and approximately $300 million in 2019 and 2020 and provides us with additional wide body capacity flexibility.","So in conclusion, our team produced outstanding results in the first quarter and we look forward to more of the same as we move into the peak summer travel period. I would like to, again, thank our 120,000 team members for the great service they provide to our customers.","With that, I will turn it over to Robert.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Derek. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I would like to start by recognizing our 120,000 employees. My colleagues have done outstanding work over the quarter and we've asked a lot of them over the last few years and they've really delivered. The first three months of the year, we saw continued improvement across the enterprise, including operational improvements, fleet refresh, customer experience and team member engagement. We continue to make smart long-term investments in things like customer service training, facilities improvements for both our employees and customers and technology to improve the overall customer experience. These investments are starting to pay real dividends, and we're really excited about the trajectory that we're on.","Our operation continued to take big steps for the first quarter. Despite the impact of Winter Storm Stella in March, which disrupted the operations at stations in the Southeast, Mideast and Northeast, American team members set new post-merger operational records in February for mainline, on-time departures, on-time arrivals and mishandled baggage. We had eight days without a single mainline cancellation in the first quarter, which is more than any year that we've had since the merger. These accomplishments demonstrate our progress in creating a consistently reliable operation for our customers and team members.","While much of the integration work is already complete, there's several noteworthy projects in the works that will refine our network and make us even stronger for our customers. Some of these projects include the March announcement of new service to eight cities from our hub in Chicago, as well as one new route in Dallas-Fort Worth and Miami. None of these 10 new additions will serve cities that have flights to other American hubs and have historically performed well.","In addition, the bank patterns at our Miami hub have been redesigned to facilitate better connections, more efficient gate utilization and faster processing through customs and immigration. One critical part of refining the network is focusing on the areas where we can maximize the value of our resources and we're building up service in profitable cities, improving the efficiency of the scheduling process and making structural changes at our hubs. These are just a few of the examples of how we're striving to invest our resources to create a seamless operation for our team members, the best product for our customers and the highest return for our owners.","On the commercial side, we rolled out the new Basic Economy product in 10 test markets in early March with encouraging results. In the 10 launch market, half of the eligible Basic Economy passengers have bought up to the main cabin, which is right in line with our forecast. We plan to continue to roll the product out to the remainder of our domestic and short haul international markets in a phased approach with more markets coming in May and June.","At the end of March, we started selling Premium Economy with our first departures on May 4. We expect to have nine widebody aircraft configured with Premium Economy by the second quarter and more as time comes in the future. We also announced an agreement to invest $200 million in China's largest carrier, China Southern Airlines. Later this year, we expect to begin codeshare and interline agreements that will give our customers approximately 70 more destinations in China, beyond Beijing and Shanghai.","Lastly, we entered into an arrangement with Scandinavian Airlines to obtain two slot pairs at London's Heathrow Airport, strengthening American's presence at a key international gateway for American and our joint business partner, British Airways.","Turning to revenue, we're very pleased with the revenue performance in the first quarter. Our first quarter consolidated PRASM was up 2%, and our first quarter TRASM was up 3.1%. This is the third consecutive quarter where our unit revenue performance was materially better than the rest of the industry. And not just the industry average, but better than each of the six largest U.S. carriers. We believe that this outperformance can be attributed to the significant investments we've made in many years of business from our people to our product and to selling, revenue management, our AAdvantage program and our mobile platform and aa.com.","And customers are noticing. We recorded our highest customer satisfaction rating since the merger, the fifth consecutive month of sequential improvement. And last week, the Harris Poll named American Airlines its Full Service Airline Brand of the Year. And earlier this year, American was named the 2017 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World.","Turning to domestic, our consolidated PRASM was up 2.3% and importantly, improved in every month in the quarter. We have been implementing a number of revenue management initiatives for the Premium cabin and they have proven very successful. Our sales initiatives are also bearing fruit. We continue to see a positive trend in corporate share in the first quarter with strong results across the network. This trend is continuing as we enter the second quarter as well.","Our Latin America performance overall was very strong, with PRASM up 7.7%. Although Brazil led the way, up 43%, strength (20:14) broad-based also. The balance of South America had positive unit revenue growth as well, while other areas within the region had low single digit declines.","The Atlantic was our weakest performing international entity with PRASM down 5.9%, but that number overstates the decline in actual performance. It requires some explanation. While our results did decline as a result of industry growth in a soft pricing environment, half of the decline that we saw is due to an out of period adjustment that positively impacted last year's results. And another point and a half is due to the decline in UK currency and our exposure to that.","Across the Pacific, PRASM was positive. This is the first positive result since the third quarter of 2014 and is a sign that we're turning the corner around our capacity build-out in the Pacific. We expect this region to continue to improve as we lap the additions of Haneda, Sydney, Auckland and Hong Kong throughout the year.","First quarter cargo revenue improved 6.3% year-over-year on strong growth, a positive trend that we've seen since the latter half of 2016. The focus that our cargo team members have placed on improving cargo's operational performance and efforts to deliver best-in-class customer experience are paying off and being recognized by the industry. American Airlines Cargo was voted Air Cargo News 2017 Cargo Airline of the Year for the third straight year. And American is the only U.S. based carrier to have been recognized with this honor in the award's 34-year history.","So looking forward, the revenue environment at American is very strong, and we expect this momentum to continue. The June quarter will mark the sixth quarter in a row of sequential improvement unit revenue and the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. Based on published guidance, we expect to outperform the industry in the second quarter as well, for the fourth quarter in a row. We continue to expect positive revenue improvements for each quarter throughout this year.","Regionally, our domestic PRASM is expected to strengthen in the quarter due to a number of initiatives focused on Premium cabin pricing and yield management and continuing gains through our investments in our sales organizations. In Latin America, we expect another quarter of strong year-over-year improvements with every entity having positive unit revenue. The Pacific entity is expected to perform in line with the first quarter.","Lastly, the Atlantic region has continued to show modest signs of improvement due to easing comps from past terror events. However, it remains challenged, as low priced carriers continue to grow and the British pound remains weak. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, we're excited about our operational commercial investments, and we expect our second quarter total revenue for ASM to be up 3% to 5% year-over-year. We rolled out our new Basic Economy product, our Premium Economy product as well, and early results are encouraging.","While we have a lot of work to do, we look forward to reporting on future successes. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operation Instructions] And we will take our first question from Kevin Crissey with Citi.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hello, Kevin.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Can you provide evidence that cultural investments are more than recouped through higher revenue? Having worked at JetBlue, I can assure you that investors are unconvinced by this argument.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, what I'm certain of is that we \u2013 the leverage in this airline is in closing the revenue gap that we have. And I'm equally certain that our ability to do that, while asking our team to work for less than their peers is a big challenge and one that I'm certain either is fair to our team nor to our leadership because it makes it increasingly difficult. So I don't know that I can directly answer your question but I'm highly confident that it is correlated. And would note, again, this isn't about us making a bet that, oh, if we can go get to rates that are \u2013 pay levels that are higher than others, that will get us something that will allow us to generate higher revenues than others. I don't think I would make that argument.","This is about us getting our team to the levels that are currently in place at our competitor airlines and consistent with the commitment we made to our team at the time of the merger that we would compensate them in line with their peers at other airlines, a commitment again that we've made consistently with each and every contract. But in the case of these two contracts that were done shortly after the merger and were put in place on five-year terms, which is also worth noting, longer terms than the other airlines are putting in place today. It just got to where the gap was too big and it was going to be in place for too long and that didn't feel right to any of us.","So I feel good about that commitment. It's a commitment we're happy to make, not just in this case, but to any of the rest of our team to the extent we see large discrepancies in our pay rates, our base pay rates versus competitors, other airlines and there's still significant amount of time and we can get that addressed through contract negotiations. You should expect us to correct it because that's the right thing to do for our team and I think \u2013 and I do believe, Kevin, what happens so long as we do that, we have an engaged and excited team that is seeing the trust they placed in us validated and they go take care of our customers and that's the best way to take care of our shareholder.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. But isn't this taking your number one cost item and handing it over to the most aggressive competitor effectively? Whoever thinks that they can pay the most goes out and signs a contract and your labor rates are going to go to that optimistic or arguably the dumbest management team out there is an argument investors could look at. You've taken it out of your hands and put it in the hands of others and that doesn't feel like what well run companies do.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes, I would beg to differ. Again, given the experience levels here, and what our teams have been through. And look, we're comfortable with the commitment. You're right, in one sense, I suppose, that if you want to look at our commitment and figure out what it means for the industry, the answer is you've got to go ask others in the industry because we're, indeed, not leading this charge. We're just making sure we're staying \u2013 we're catching up. So where it goes in the future will be dependent on what others do in the future.","But look, I feel, I think again, I think this is \u2013 what you're seeing here is the maturing of an industry and an industry that has seen the people work in this business go through incredibly difficult times and what we needed to have happen was that get corrected. And I think look \u2013 and I think it's largely corrected. We were encouraged to hear Delta, apparently at their Investor Day, mentioned that they put in place a 6% pay increase for all their team, for all their non-union members, which at Delta is everyone, I believe, except their pilots and their dispatchers. So the vast majority of the airline they increased 6% again this year but note on their Investor Day they thought that was their last industry reset and they would see inflationary increases in the future.","So I don't know that I agree with your premise but I certainly agree with our commitment and that is we're going to make sure, because it's important that our team who is an incredibly important part of our product is excited and engaged. And it's hard to do that if they see others that do the same job they do and don't do it as well at other companies, getting compensated more on an hourly basis. So that's important to us. It will continue to be important.","I don't think it's dramatically different than if you saw another airline make some major enhancement to their in-flight product, you would see us match those because it is an important part of making sure that we're taking care of our customers. And these are the people to take care of our customers, the people that are on the frontline, not just our pilots and flight attendants, our mechanics, our fleet service employees, our reservations agents, our gate agents, every single one of them deserves the same commitment and we're happy to make it.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Moving next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Doug, you have this plan to achieve pre-tax profits mid-cycle of $5 billion. Over the last year or so, it feels like you may have been retreating from that somewhat. Consensus estimates certainly don't embrace that outcome and now, of course, you're adding additional costs to your internal forecast. When do you think you'll be able to reverse direction and start moving towards that objective? Or are we doing the right thing by kind of just ignoring it?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, Jamie, I think you referenced some comments that we made at your conference and the rest of the group may not know what you're talking about, so let me try.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Oh, I'm sorry.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","That's quite all right. And I don't know, your conference is so well attended maybe everybody knows exactly what you're talking about but I'll try anyway.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","When it doesn't snow.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes, that did make it rough. So look, and importantly, I need to restate it because \u2013 I would restate it slightly differently than what you just said. Here's what I said and here's what we do. And it's a really important point so I'm glad you raised it. We believe the \u2013 we have a company today that over \u2013 on average, over time in today's current environment, should generate pre-tax earnings of around $5 billion. Now, look, it's a volatile business. We all know that. That hasn't changed. While that level of earnings is a number that no one has ever fathomed before, the fact is it's still volatile. So, we think it will average $5 billion over time. We think the better years will look around like $7 billion and the lesser years will look around like $3 billion but over time, we should expect this company can generate over time $5 billion.","Now, look, that is not just a statement that we make. That is how we compensate our every one of the employees at American Airlines that get an annual bonus, so everyone essentially manager level and above. That's why this is important. We use that formula I just said to fund our annual incentive pool, and we've done that since the merger. Now again, the $3 billion and $7 billion have moved around a little bit as we've gotten more comfortable with post-merger earnings, but the $5 billion hasn't changed since the day of the merger. And maybe it will change one day but we're not changing it \u2013 we're certainly \u2013 nothing about what we're seeing today leads us to believe that should change.","So that's what I reported to you all is that \u2013 that's what we think about the earnings prospects of this company. And not only do we think that, that's how we fund our incentive pool. So, again, the way the incentive pool works, not that you care that much about our executive compensation, but I think it's really important to what you think about our expectations for the business. We fund the incentive pool by telling the team, look, if we have a year where we make $5 billion, we're going to fund the incentive pool at target. If we have a year where we make $3 billion, we're going to fund it at half of target, below that, there's no bonus. And if we have a year where we make $7 billion that's the maximum, which is double the bonus.","So \u2013 and you're right, no one on the Street, I think, is forecasting $5 billion for American this year. But we didn't change that formula for the team. So this \u2013 if indeed the Street is right, this will be one of those years that's slightly worse. And there will be years in the future that are slightly better. What's important about this point is that if we are right, and, again, we're not just throwing out numbers here.","This is how we're incentivizing our management team. If we're right, our stock is so undervalued it defies logic in my view. If we're right, and this company is going to \u2013 over time going to average $5 billion pre-tax, really easy \u2013 really simple math and you guys are a lot better at this than me, but I'll go to the simple math, $5 billion taxed is $3 billion, $3 billion and for a company today that is trading at somewhere around \u2013 has a market cap of about $24 billion, that's eight times what I'm telling you I think is our steady state earnings. Eight times steady state earnings when the average S&P company over the last 20-something years has had a multiple of earnings of something like, help me, Dan, 19 times.","Feels like people don't believe the $5 million (sic) [$5 billion] (34:05) number. And that's fine. But we do. So that's why we're so bullish on the company. And the investments we've made today only strengthen that view. We don't look at that and think, oh, gosh, now it's $300 million harder to get to $5 billion. We look at this and say this reinforces our view that we're going to continue the momentum we have in improving the revenues by these investments we're making, and we feel even better about that in the long-term. So that's what I said, and that's what we still believe.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","As part of that, it looks like it still takes considerably more American employees to get the job done than at Delta. And it's tough for me to accurately do that analysis. There's some outsourcing issues we have to account for, but there do seem to be opportunities for American to become more efficient, and your letter last night seems to imply as much but maybe that's just my interpretation. Can you quantify the opportunity to improve labor efficiency?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, look, I would say this. When you say it's difficult for you to do that, I would argue it's almost impossible for you to compare those numbers. There are enormous differences in the amount of work that American does in-house versus what some other airlines do outside. So you wouldn't see it in the head count or in the salaries, you'd see it, instead, in their numbers and their outside services, and we try to do similar analysis and you can't get there, I don't think. But I'll tell you this, as is the case in most mergers, when you're running two airlines, you need to have some redundancies in place that as you get through the merger, you can eliminate, and we still have some of that in place.","But rather than trying to quantify it, because I don't know that we know what it is yet and\/or how we're going to manage it and over what period of time, I would just point you to the guidance that Derek rattled off on our cost trends. We had CASM ex fuel in the first quarter here of 8%. The second quarter we say 6% to 8%. The third quarter we say 3% to 5%. Fourth quarter we say 2% to 4%. That includes \u2013 again, those estimates include this adjustment that we made last night. So that's a rapidly declining year-over-year increase in cost. And while we're in no position to start giving 2018 guidance yet, I would certainly expect that that trend would continue into 2018 and that is that number of 2% to 4%. And fourth quarter 2017 would be even lower for the full year of 2018.","So it's coming down. The rate of growth is certainly slowing. But look, we recognize that our job is to make sure we're running the airline efficiently, and we believe we're doing so today. There are some things that because we're still running in some cases two separate airlines that may have us doing that less efficiently than we'll be able to do over time, but we'll make sure we get there as quickly as we possibly can. I think you'll start to see most of that in 2018 and, again, nothing to report now on how big that will be because I don't think we know. I know we don't know because I don't know.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. Doug, I appreciate you taking my questions this morning. Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doug, on that note, in terms of the $5 billion, kind of, run rate pre-tax earnings, I guess, when you consider that, and given the permanent step-up in labor, does it change your view at all of capital allocation? With these higher fixed costs, would you consider more debt pay-down over share repurchases going forward? And if not, why?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","The short answer is no. And again, I come back to the overriding point, which is this increase in our near-term expenses in no way changes our view about our long-term prospects. Indeed, it gives us more confidence that they're achievable. So nothing about this makes us think anything about \u2013 and, again, let me make one other point on that because this seems to be a theme \u2013 a recurring theme that I'm having trouble getting across. We look at this longer term than \u2013 and on the long-term, this was an expense that was coming. There's no way when we got to 2020 and did new contracts, of course, that we're going to go sign new contracts with our team that were going to keep in place this sort of a gap.","So we accelerated an expense. Again, not something we do lightly and not something we had to do, something we thought we should do. But none of this, to us, feels like any sort of change in the long-term prospects, and when we think about things like share repurchase and capital allocation, we think about it in the long-term. So no, no change in that. We're really confident with our current capital allocation. We think we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, we're happy yet again, as Derek noted, to make some purchases in the quarter that were a good bit less than the price at least as we opened today, and so we feel good about that. We think we \u2013 another thing worth noting again on the capital allocation piece is, yeah, our debt is higher, but it's because our assets are better.","Another point that I think sometimes gets lost, maybe our fault for not mentioning it enough, but this higher levels in debt versus our competitors is driven by the fact that we have a much younger fleet, and that fleet is a lot more valuable. There's a fleet they have in place and that drives higher debt, of course. So we feel good about the capital allocation, and we will continue to do what's best for our shareholders and our team as we go forward.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Understood. I guess, maybe kind of changing gears a little bit, maybe one for Robert. Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing on the Trans-Atlantic, given kind of this onslaught of low cost carrier capacity into the summer? Have you adapted the way you manage inventory in response to this at all? And kind of what are your expectations for demand on Trans-Atlantic as we head through the summer?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'll let Don give some more color. But we're optimistic about what we're seeing close in. But as you note, have concerns about capacity in the long run. Don?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes. I mean, we \u2013 clearly, there's a lot of capacity growth, and there's a pretty active pricing environment. The industry did a big reset in terms of pricing last year heading into the fourth quarter where we've been more \u2013 a bit more aggressive versus low cost carriers. We do have easing comps. So as we go forward, I think we're going to see the comps get a bit easier. We also ran last year at relatively low load factors, U.S. point of sale demand was not as strong as we had hoped last year. Although we're seeing some weakness coming out of the UK, overall, the U.S. point of sale seems very robust this year, and we expect, as we go through the summer that we're going to run materially higher load factors than last year.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you, everyone.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. Good morning. So I know, maybe it's a question for Derek, since Derek is the one that made this comment last quarter. I know you said, obviously, it's early to guide to 2018 CASM, but just last quarter you said you think you'd be able to keep CASM ex under 2% over the next couple of years. I'm not sure if you were referring to an average number, or each of the two years? But given the new labor cost increase, do you still feel like that's doable?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes, I still feel like that's doable for each of the two years, not just over the two years but for each of the two years.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Good. And then just to be totally clear, I think, Robert, you said you expect continuing positive improvements in RASM each quarter this year. You weren't saying the 3Q growth rate was going to get better than 2Q or just saying it's going to be above zero, right?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Do you want to give us maybe an early quick read on how you're thinking about 3Q, anything we should know about in terms of like calendar weirdness, or capacity or anything you're lapping, just to kind of give us an early thought, how to think about that sort of second derivative growth rate?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No, there's really \u2013 there was a lot of pricing action in the domestic market last year that kind of got sorted out in July that had an impact on some of the bookings through August in particular. October actually was a bit of a weak month for just about everybody last year. But other than that, I think it's nothing stands out as being dramatically impacting the last half of 2017.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Just on the combination of CapEx and pension funding, can you walk us through that this year, 2018 and 2019?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. So in this year, we'll have $4.4 billion in combination, so CapEx of $4.1 billion. Pensions, we did $279 million. In 2018, CapEx \u2013 aircraft CapEx is $1.6 billion, and pension right now we're forecasting $1.1 billion. But one thing I want to note on that, that's an assumption that the mortality tables do change. If the mortality tables do not change, that'll be reduced by about $400 million, so we have the most conservative number in there. So it's $1.6 billion in aircraft CapEx and $1.1 billion in pension payments. And then in 2019, aircraft CapEx is $2.8 billion and pension payment is right at a $1 billion.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","And is that $1 billion level \u2013 for a longer-term model, is that $1 billion level kind of what we should be thinking about?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No, it drops in \u2013 in 2020 it drops to $600 million; and 2021, it drops to $600 million. And those are all assuming the mortality table changes. If those don't change, then those could be modified, but it goes down to $600 million in 2020 and 2021, so I'd say the run rate is more $600 million past to the 2019 timeframe.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. And we should add $1.5 billion in non-aircraft to those numbers?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","At least through 2020 and then I think it'll come down to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks for that detail. Have you looked at \u2013 I know at least one competitor was able to go into the unsecured market and get very attractive rates to sort of advance fund some of that. Have you analyzed that? Is that something you could even do, given the higher leverage?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We have analyzed it. We could do it if we want. We think we're \u2013 we don't have any requirement to do any payment until 2018 and don't believe we should go forward with that. I think the $1.1 billion we're doing in 2018 will get us to 80% funded which is exactly where one of my competitors went to. So that's the reason we're going to 2018. We only have to do, I think it's $60 million in 2018, so the $1.1 billion is significantly over what we're required to do in order for us to get to that 80% funded once the Airline Relief Act comes off. So, well, it's similar to what they're doing, we just don't need to do it until 2018.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Duane.","Operator","We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hello.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the time.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Robert and Don, this'll probably be for you. You \u2013 your updated RASM guide points to sequential improvement that's relatively modest versus peers and relative to just what you posted in 1Q, and you've highlighted a lot of revenue opportunities that are impressive out there. What do you think is the driver there in terms of the lack of an acceleration, given all the things that you've got going on?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'm not so sure I'd characterize it like that because in all honesty, what we're seeing is a lot of demand for our Premium cabin, and that I think is a sign that the kind of investments that we're making are taking root. We see that strength holding strong forward in the business market and from a business perspective as well. And I think that our outperformance is going to continue. It \u2013 we've got a good impressive string here, and that's what we see going forward. Don?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes...","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Go ahead, Don. I'm sorry.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I \u2013 first of all, let's not, I guess, confuse guidance with performance. Guidance is guidance and not everybody hits their guidance. So we'll see how the actuals come in when we get through the second quarter. Although on the \u2013 from a guidance perspective, this looks like a \u2013 sequentially we're not increasing as much. But this will again be the fourth quarter in a row where our performance is better than everybody else's, and so we'll just have to wait and see where the actuals come in, in terms of year-over-year versus others.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Don. That's what I was going to say. And again, the others may meet their guidance and we may exceed our guidance. If you're asking us to forecast the gap versus the others, we're certainly not forecasting that that gap will narrow in the second quarter. We just think we probably have \u2013 we may have different biases in our forecasting. Ours might be more conservative than theirs. But if the second quarter actuals come in and that gap closes, that's, I don't know, we'll look at why that happened if that happens, but we certainly don't expect that.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Point taken. And the other question, a bit more nuanced, can you talk about the outlook for the LatAm market? Robert, I think you provided some color for 2Q but I was looking for more, just beyond, as far as puts and takes in regard to supply demand, what South America is looking like, Mexico, Caribbean, et cetera.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay. This is Don. We had, obviously, a very solid first quarter performance in Latin America, Brazil led the way. We had positive unit revenue in all of South America and low single digit declines in the rest of the South America market. As we look forward into the second quarter, we see continuing strength, actually strength improving. And in the second quarter, we expect a positive year-over-year unit revenue in every entity in Latin America that it looks very, very robust at this point.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And just broader puts and takes as we look beyond 2Q as far as what you're seeing or thinking on the supply side?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","We're not really seeing anything dramatic on the supply side in LatAm, overall. We're seeing affirmative growth in Mexico but we're seeing a lot of demand growth as well, but nothing that we see that's going to change our current outlook.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","We'll go next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Hey, Doug, you've alluded a couple of times to this opportunity to go drive some relative revenue improvement relative to your peers over the next few years. I mean, I guess, I was just hoping that you'd help characterize where do you think the relative revenue discount is coming from today? I mean, is it network or is it on-time performance? And can you help us understand, sort of, what are the components of that you think are addressable versus those that perhaps aren't as addressable?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I'll let Robert try and do that probably more in terms of the things we think we can do to close as opposed to what drivers are. Go ahead, Robert.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Darryl, I'd just like to point out that I think there are a number of things that are benefiting us that are certainly due to the investments we've been making, but in all honesty a lot of catch-up and I do think is \u2013 will benefit us and it's going to be unique to American. Some of the things that are just taking root now, as we've talked about, we are still confident that between our Basic and Premium Economy products that we're talking about a $1 billion worth of incremental revenue, which is sizable.","I think everybody \u2013 I think you know that we haven't really had a premium product for our widebody long haul flying that's been consistent out in the marketplace. And so, this year we will finally have a lie-flat product across all international entities, which is fantastic.","We think that we have some density issues with our narrow body fleet that we will be addressing in the coming years as well that I think will have benefits in terms of overall revenue production and also will help us from a unit cost perspective as well.","Don and team have been making improvements in revenue management. And I want to underscore the work that we're doing with our sales team as well. And I'd like to say that a lot of that's baked into the current numbers, but I'm glad that as we look forward that that is just coming on, and we think is going to continue to drive outperformance versus the industry.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So you think all that stuff, and I realize that it is difficult to see this, but if you were to take all of that stuff you that just mentioned there, which seem relatively addressable in nature and add them all up that that's enough to offset both the discount, for instance, from Delta that you're achieving today as well as what I'd call probably a positive or relatively positive impact from you already having to do a fleet in the industry. Is that a fair characterization or is there something structural about the network that's also causing you some difficulty?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","When we take a look at the list of initiatives that we are pursuing, we think that that will definitely make us competitive.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Darryl.","Operator","And please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much. So, Doug, back in 2007 when you were running Airways, you said at the time you were talking to some bankers to get a sense of what the loyalty program could be worth. We've spoken to a couple of guys in private equity and they would use about a 15 times EBITDA multiple on it. That puts the valuation somewhere around $30 billion to $40 billion. Your market cap is half that. So two questions, would that surprise you, that valuation, and if it made sense to see what it was worth back then, why doesn't it make sense to do the same thing now?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, first off, I can't believe I said that in 2007, but if you say I did, okay. This has been an issue, at least from our perspective is it's part and parcel of the airline and part of running the airline and part of inventory management and something that at least in my recollection I've never considered as a particularly good idea to spend out \u2013 maybe when we forgot exactly how we financed survival it might have been something we were looking at.","But so, anyway, rather than trying to figure out why I said something in 2007, I'll tell you what we think now, which is. Yes. Well, first up to your larger question, would it surprise me to learn that's the value of the advantage program? I would have to say, yes. Because that is greater than the value of American Airlines in total as we sit here today. But I am not arguing with you. You guys are better at doing valuations than we are, and the market will decide.","I find it odd that simply separating something that is inside the airline today and putting it into a separate entity with the exact same cash flows would somehow generate that much incremental value, but again, that's something that you guys can figure out better than we can. But actually, I should be careful on that. If we believe that, then of course we would be spending perhaps more effort trying to figure out how to spend it out. What I believe is the advantage program is really valuable. It's an incredible part of our airline. It's a significant reason that we feel so good about our future. And we maximize the value for our shareholders. And whether or not that is done in-house or in a separate entity, that's going to be the case. And the value will be created.","So we agree with you, there's a lot of value there. We agree with you that perhaps that's another reason the airline is undervalued, I just think we're undervalued for all sorts of reasons. I think people don't appreciate what's happened in this industry or this airline, and how it's going to make a difference in the long term. And that's where we're focused.","As I told you last time, we agree with your pointing this out, and we will continue to try to do a better job of pointing out to investors as best we can the value of the advantage program. But it's part and parcel of the airline and a really important part of the airline and one that we're happy with the way it's being managed and the value it's producing. And it's in our \u2013 in the results of the airline today and in the future.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I mean I guess, Doug, I would just say that the past two years at Jamie's conference, you've made your \u2013 making the lead presentation and talked about why there's less cyclicality in the business and the credit card and loyalty program isn't a part of that. So I'm just wondering, do you not mention it because you don't believe that it's an important part of improving cyclicality? Or are you just hesitant to talk about it because it seems like the first rule of having an airline cobrand card is you don't talk about the airline cobrand card?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. It's not that. So, yes, okay, fair enough. We should probably spend a little more time pointing out that that stream of our earnings is a little less volatile than other streams. So noted.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Doug.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Moving on to Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question. As I think about your domestic route network. I know you're focused on Los Angeles, and maybe you can give us a update on facilities and what you're doing there in terms of have the new facilities opening and so on. And then when I think about the growth that's occurring in Fort Lauderdale and the other side of the country, you guys have the big hub in Miami, I get it, in Latin America and so on. But do you worry about the huge increase in capacity an hour and a half north of one of your major, most important hubs and just wondering if you can comment on kind of those two issues?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Steve Johnson will take the LA piece.","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Helane. Just with respect to facilities in Los Angeles, we \u2013 I think everybody knows that earlier this year or late last year, we actually opened the connector between the Bradley Terminal and Terminal 4, which is in use. I got to use it personally just the other day. It's a great way to get from international connection to our domestic service or vice versa. And that's been a big hit with our customers.","Then, very recently, we moved our limited operation that was in Terminal 6 to Terminal 5 and to adjacent to the tunnel that goes between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5. So those gates are now much more adjacent and much more convenient for our customers to use. And then finally, we're in negotiations with LAWA for a long-term lease at LAX that will change the face of our facilities there. Those negotiations are confidential beyond that, so I won't say anymore, but we're hopeful that we can get those completed in the next four or five weeks.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. And, Helane, I'll talk a little bit more about South Florida. So, we understand the competition and then also the nature of the markets, and so there's always appropriate consideration. But look, Fort Lauderdale, it's a nice, local market operation. We view Miami differently. We do view it as the ideal connecting opportunity and hub for American, but not just American, of any carrier to the South America. We've got a nice position there. And a lot of the work that we're doing is really to try to maximize the flows and over the long run, we do think that that is something that is going to set us apart. And you may have noticed recently that's actually helped us in markets like Cuba, where we can do things because of the connecting power of the hub, and we're going to continue to make sure that we maximize utility of that operation.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Moving next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Michael.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just two quick ones here. Bob, you talked about positive improvement in corporate share when you were talking about domestic PRASM. Any particular sectors or regions where you saw some share gains that you can elaborate on?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","It's Don. I mean, to be honest with you...","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Don.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","We saw improvement across the board for our \u2013 in corporate markets. And this, again, marks a kind of high-water mark for us since the merger. And in the first quarter, we had our best performance in terms of both share and share gap, and our trends heading into second quarter are also very strong.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just second, just a clarification on the CapEx deferral to Derek. Is that \u2013 so is that $800 million or $1.1 billion? I'm not sure if it's $300 million in two years or $300 million per year?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","$300 million per year. So it's $1.1 billion over the three years.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Savi Syth with Raymond James has our next question.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. A question on the \u2013 in the last few years, I think American has been a little bit more exposed to some areas that have seen greater pressure, be it South America, be it some of the aggressive pricing on low-cost carrier markets, and we are seeing that reverse. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on how much more we could see, or how much more there is to go? And maybe some that might not come back in the near-term?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay. I mean, basically clearly we had some kind of unique headwinds that affected us, right? The Southwest growth at Love Field, the OCC growth Brazil, Venezuela. But we really kind of came out from under all that at the end of the second quarter of last year. And so, Brazil's clearly one area where we're seeing some year-over-year improvement, but the rest of that really doesn't really drive any year-over-year change. So the real value we're seeing and the uptick in our revenue performance, although Brazil is a piece of that, it's really being driven by all of the other initiatives we have out there in the marketplace.","It's the new airplanes, it's the new product, it's the restructuring of our Advantage program, it's the investment we're making in sales, and the investment and change we're making in revenue management. All the things we're doing, which is a long list, right, is really what's driving the benefit. It's not just some lucky, fortunate year-over-year comparison. It's really kind of fundamental, the fundamentals that are getting better for us.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sorry. And I meant, not necessarily a comparison issue but maybe a reversal issue of some of the pressures that you saw. Finally a follow-up on Mike's question on corporate, was \u2013 are we seeing corporate revenue and yields up now year-over-year? Is that firmly in that trend?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Actually in the fourth quarter we did see yields come up. In the first quarter of this year, we saw yields actually for corporate flattish.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Moving on to Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just kind of going back to comments earlier around the revenue initiatives, specifically some initiatives around improving the density on the narrow body fleet. Can you just expand on that for a moment in terms of when you think that could begin to impact results and sort of the opportunity there?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","So those are things that we look at on an ongoing basis. And again, some of the things that you will see showing up is the work that we've done with our wide body, our 777 reconfiguration program where we're moving to a standard configuration. So that's on that front. And we think that there's opportunities with the narrow bodies as well. And that is something that you'll see in 2018 and beyond.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then just kind of following up on that as well. Thinking about your prepared comments on Basic and Premium Economy, just sort of curious if you could update us in terms of how you're thinking about the portion of your domestic flights that will have those two additional classes of service on them by year-end. And then, just what sort of revenue impact that's expected to have in the back half of the year as comps perhaps get a little bit more challenging?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","So in terms of Basic, that's something that we anticipate for \u2013 it will be something that we offer throughout our network.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Yes.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","So for Basic, it's really just the timing of the rollout for us, right? So, we have more markets coming in May and June. These are still, I guess, I would view as kind of test markets, the next two tranches similar to the first tranche. But we're going to end up expanding this broadly across the whole network eventually, right, and pacing item for that is really going to be our training and staffing. But we're committed to roll this out everywhere, and we're quite encouraged by the initial results.","Premium Economy is the next thing. And we don't really kind of get to a critical mass of airplanes on our roll-out of Premium Economy probably until we get in first quarter of next year. So we still kind of consider what we're doing right now kind of a test, and we're very focused on this. A lot of it is channel education. We're the first U.S. airline to have this product, and so we need to make sure that all of our distribution, all of our selling channels know what the product is. And we need to make sure we work with our third-party distributors as well to make sure that the product is being appropriately displayed in all the systems, so people will understand what it is and what they're buying. And that's what we're focused on right now for Premium Economy. But, again, it will be critical mass by the first quarter of next year.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thanks again for the time.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And Brandon Oglenski with Barclays has our next question. Sorry. Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research has our next question.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Dan.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Doug, help us understand why the $5 billion pre-tax target is realistic from your perspective. You're saying it's the right hurdle for executive compensation, and I know you. You're not pulling that out of thin air. Why is that? So from where you sit, what are the larger revenue opportunities over the cycle that gives you confidence you can offset the labor headwinds this morning, and what are the new initiatives worth over the coming one to two years?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I think Robert laid those out pretty well. He can lay them out again for you, if you'd like, as to what the initiatives are. And as to the value themselves, we mentioned that as well.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Basic and Premium Economy we mentioned.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right. So look, that is the value that gives us confidence. All you need to do is look at the current gap in revenue per ASM as soon as we close that, you easily get to numbers like $5 billion as a run rate number. So, look, but that's not how we go about coming up with this number. The way we come up with this number is knowing what we do about where the industry is today and where American Airlines is positioned in that industry, both of which we feel good about and both of which feel dramatically different than they've ever been before.","And based upon that view, that's what this feel \u2013 that's what the company feels like to us. I don't want to portend or pretend that we go and that \u2013 those numbers I said to you are the basis of some enormous analysis that's laid out for the next 15 years. It's where we believe this company is today. And look, the facts support it. Since the time of the merger, we have had earnings in that range. This is a worse year than others, and it's still in the range.","One of the things I do like to point out to people when they \u2013 part of the reason \u2013 part of the explanation, at least, I get sometimes, Dan, from investors as to why it is even if you believe what we \u2013 why it is that that we are so undervalued relative to other industries. The reason I get is, well, it's because investors are afraid you guys are going to do all the things you've done in the past to eliminate value.","And as someone who's been around through all those years, I know what those things are and were, and the things that are rattled off, as you know, you're going to grow faster than \u2013 once you start making money, you'll grow faster than demand. Once you start making money, you'll give more to labor than you did when you were making less money, and they'll take some of the upside that should go to shareholders. Fuel prices will go up, and you guys won't be able to react.","I would just point out this: In the last three years, all those things have happened. And that is unit revenues of \u2013 capacity has grown in excess of demand in the last couple years; and as a result, unit revenues have fallen at rates that we haven't seen in this business since 9\/11. Probably more than they've ever fallen over a two-year period at any point in time. So unit revenues have declined because we've added more capacity than there is demand. Employee pay has increased at a rate that no one \u2013 that has never been seen before. And so that's happened. Fuel prices, indeed, have increased from where they were a year ago at 20%, 30%.","So all that stuff has happened, and yet here we are \u2013 and indeed, that has an impact on earnings and the earnings are lower. But while they are \u2013 they're lower, they're at the lower end of the range I talked about \u2013 actually, not lower end of the range \u2013 just lower than target. So I feel really good about that target over time. All those things have happened. All the things people are worried that we would go do indeed have happened. I don't think those are any surprises, by the way. I don't think that's bad management. I think all those things are the right things to do. The reason capacity has grown in excess of supply is because we do have a different business. And when fuel prices fell as much as they did, the economics changed dramatically and more capacity rightfully came in because it was profitable capacity.","The wages and benefits of employees in the airline business were a big part of how this \u2013 how the industry has survived and those had to be adjusted as the industry got past survival. So look, all of that stuff's happened. All the things that I think people were worried about we've done and we still have a business that is producing returns like it's never seen before. And also, I believe all of those things have gotten to a point where you \u2013 where we start to move into an area where you see kind of a more mature industry behave like a mature industry. But look, we will see over time, but I can't stress enough how bullish we are on the future.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for that. And I guess maybe I didn't ask my question \u2013 and maybe I'd have to wait for the Investor Day, but I guess I kind of want...","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Also, you \u2013 I rattled off on my tirade and I didn't \u2013 and we didn't answer your question. So Robert, what are initiatives for Dan?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No, I just \u2013 yeah, the fortunate thing, again, as I said before is I think we've got some catch-up items and a number of things that we can improve on. So the list of items is long and it is something that is part of a plan that we are working through. So as I take a look, right, we have both fleet and network simplification and optimization activities that are going on right now. Some of them have been held up by integration, but the good news is, is that we have more in the hopper coming on both network and fleet.","I mentioned to you about Basic Economy. We think that, that has legs throughout our system and it's just in its infancy. We think that Premium Economy will have tremendous benefits for our international network. I mentioned to you about wide-body interior improvements, notably the 777s in terms of finally getting lie-flat and density that's appropriate. I think that as I said, we have narrow-body density opportunities as well to pursue. Don has talked a lot about the RM improvements that have been made and will continue to be made and are being felt in the results that we have today.","We are just now getting started on our re-launch of our sales activity and bringing on a full force of sales reps that, quite frankly, has been lacking over the last three years as we focused on other things. We are re-designing our AAdvantage program that we think will bring a considerable benefit as well. And as we've talked in the past, we think that there is a lot of benefit coming with our cobrand card as well. The list is long. And, again, we're just getting started. And a lot of this, fortunately, benefit is going to come to American.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No, go ahead. You got another question?","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Well, I was just going to say, taking what you rattled off, over the course of the cycle, these initiatives are worth what in terms \u2013 X billion dollars, $2 billion, $2.5 billion? If you can just help size it for us or, again, maybe we have to wait for the Investor Day. I'm not sure.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Wait for the Investor Day. We haven't \u2013 outside of Basic and Premium Economy, we haven't sized it and we'll be happy to shed more light on it later this year.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","And we'll now go to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in at the end of the call here. Sorry, there's a few overlapping today. But, Doug, I missed your opening remarks here but you've been a huge proponent that this industry has changed. We just heard you respond to Dan's question about how the industry did add capacity. We are paying up labor. Earnings and margins have come down for two years now.","So if you want to be getting a better evaluation like a more stable consistent industrial company, don't we need to reduce earnings volatility? And part of that process is, obviously, managing cost inflation with price inflation or the opportunities in your market. So I don't want to come across as being un-respectful to your front line employees, which definitely work hard and deserve increases but as a manager of this business, how do we talk to a shareholder that says we need to take the costs up-front, margins need to come down now but trust us. What's the inflection point that drives that better in the future?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Brandon. Thanks for asking. And, again, with \u2013 I did try to address this earlier in the stuff you may have missed but I'll try again. The \u2013 I do think volatility of earnings are dramatically different than they used to be, and more importantly, the level of earnings at which we \u2013 the mean level from which you vacillate is much, much higher, and I don't \u2013 and that is different this time, and it's an enormous difference and I don't think that's been appreciated. So, but as to your volatility point, again, this is what we're doing today in terms of taking a group of our team members who was going to be, for two and a half years, paid a good bit less than their peers at other airlines, who were doing the same functions, is entirely consistent with my view that earnings are less volatile.","This is getting to a level of compensation across the industry that needed to occur. And once you get to that level, I think you'll see, as you do in other mature businesses, that labor costs, certainly one, you get efficiencies over time, as good businesses do. But, two, labor costs per employee increases at rates commensurate with inflation. And I think it's what you'll see in this business. But all of us had to get to a point where we got to what, really, team members in this business deserve and none of them were there because of everything we had to do to survive. So that's what I think is happening here. It doesn't affect by any means our view about the long-term value; indeed as I said at the outset, it increases our confidence in our ability to go create that value because we can't do that without an excited and engaged team.","We're making huge progress in that regard. We've got some momentum with this that has us very excited and we were concerned about our ability to maintain that momentum for the next two and a half years, while asking our team to live by a contract that they just happened to sign earlier than the rest of our team, and as a result found themselves further behind their peers than the rest of our team. So that didn't seem right to us, and that's \u2013 so when we see things that don't feel right, we correct them, we don't live by contracts we have in place, and that's what we did. And we feel extremely good about that, and it makes us feel even better about the long-term prospects.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that response, Doug, and Wall Street can be fickle. So hopefully this works out.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay. It'll work for the long term. Thanks.","Operator","We'll pause for just a moment. We'll go first to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Good morning, Andrea.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Good morning, Doug. This question might be more for Robert. I was wondering if you could talk on the Basic Economy side. You mentioned how from a revenue standpoint, how customers are \u2013 or 50% of them are choosing main cabin over (79:41) and they're offered both. But I was wondering if you could talk more on the operations side of, how is it going for your gate agents, your flight attendants to implement this new fare that has restrictions on it for customers on the planes this past March? How has that gone so far on those 10 routes?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, thanks, Andrea. I think \u2013 look, we're benefiting from the tremendous amount of work that went in to planning. So we spent months and months prior to launch, prior to announcement, and did extensive training. And fortunately, I think our metered approach is working. And what we're seeing is that by and large, our customers understand the restrictions that are on the Basic Economy fare, and are complying with what our practice is at the gate. And so we're not seeing a lot of difficulty and really no issues to talk about.","And I think that that's really evidenced by the kind of results that we're producing from an operational perspective, there hasn't been any impact to reliability, there hasn't been any impact on on-time departures. And I think what you'd hear from our in-flight crew is that they appreciate the benefit that comes with having fewer bags that are being brought on to the aircraft. So overall, I'm really pleased, but we're going to continue to take a measured approach and make sure that we're not surprised.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Are you concerned at all about the summer travel season when these fares are introduced, when you have fliers that maybe typically don't fly as often? Maybe this is their once-a-year sort of trip and aren't as familiar with the changes. Are you a little concerned about how that might work at the gate?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, we'll be ready for it, and I think that's the key, is making sure that we let people \u2013 making sure that people are clear on what they're purchasing and certainly making sure that our team is ready to help and assist in any way possible. And at the end of the day, again, given the loads expected and strong demand, we anticipate that this will actually make things a little bit easier on the aircraft because of fewer carry-on bags.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Good morning. Hey, this might be for Derek, I'm not sure. I wanted to ask, is there a place in your fleet for the A350?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. No, I think there is. I mean it's \u2013 but we're going to \u2013 we had a lot of wide-bodies come in. We had 787s and we had A350s coming on top of each other, so we needed to manage our delivery schedule and where our wide-bodies are. So at this point in time, yes. So we just pushed them off two years to make sure that we had a \u2013 didn't have too many wide-bodies coming to us at one point in time.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Are you considering at all maybe converting those to another Airbus model?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Not at this time, no.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Okay. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Mary.","Operator","Moving next to Ted Reed with TheStreet.","Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc.","Thank you. I have two questions about consumer perception. The first is consumer perception of the airline industry seems kind of low, and I just wonder if you made \u2013 if that was a consideration in these pay increases.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, look, we've been working on this for six-seven months so if you're talking about recent incidents, absolutely not. If you're \u2013 if you're asking do we think paying our team in line with our peers helps us do a better job of taking care of customers, absolutely, I absolutely believe that. But, yes, if you're asking if this is related to some high profile consumer events of recent times. Absolutely not, we've been working on this for several months.","Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc.","All right. Thank you. Second thing; in the case of the stroller incident, it seems from the video that a passenger assaulted a flight attendant. Are there any plans to have criminal charges against that passenger?","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","You lost us on that. But no.","Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc.","Any reaction to the \u2013 to the video and the way the passengers \u2013 the way that the male passenger acted?","Elise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Which video are you talking about?","Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc.","The stroller video with the passenger in first class seeming to assault and approach the flight attendant sort of maliciously.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes, Ted, we don't have any comment on that. We're \u2013 the \u2013 we've commented on the incident itself. It was \u2013 and did everything we could to make sure we apologized to the customers involved. We have an amazing team of people in American Airlines which is why we like to do the things that we do today. And they are out there doing incredible things every day.","We sometimes, because of our policies and procedures, put them in difficult situations, we are going to work to make sure we minimize those, but we are really happy with the job they do. And we are focused \u2013 and very proud of the job they do. And obviously our customers \u2013 we look to provide great service to our customers in the same way by giving our team the tools they need for their jobs because all they really want to do is take care of our customers. So anyway, that's where we are on that, and nothing new to report.","Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks Ted.","Operator","Moving on to Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Excuse me. My question was just on Basic Economy again. Do you guys see the commercial value of that coming more from new passengers you'd attract who might otherwise fly just (85:56) other low cost carrier? Or is it more of what it enables you to do with your standard economy fares and what you're able to charge for those with this new bucket on the low end?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","This is Don Casey. The value comes \u2013 we know that there are many customers that are willing to spend a little bit more to fly on American because of the great product that we have. And under the current distribution models in the industry, it's very difficult to display anything other than the lowest fare.","So by having two different products and different product attributes, this allows customers to actually make a choice which product is right for them. And we believe there are many occasions where customers are willing to pay just a little bit more to fly on American and the great product that we have. And if all they're really interested in is just having the lowest fair, that's the only thing that's really important to them, then we have a good product for them as well.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Good morning.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Daniel Cravens.","Daniel Cravens","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everybody, to the American Airlines Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. In the room with us today for the call is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Kirby, President; Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. And also in the room for the Q&A session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; and Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs.","Like we normally do, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he'll provide an overview of our financial results; Derek will then walk through the details in the quarter and provide some color and a guidance for the remainder of the year; Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance; and then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and then lastly questions from the media.","But before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future events, our future revenues and cost, forecast for capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q that was also issued this morning for the quarter ended June 30.","In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures on the call, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website on aa.com under the More About American Investor Relations section. The webcast of this call will also be archived on the website and the information that we're giving you today on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Doug Parker.","William Douglas Parker","Thank you, Dan. Thanks, everyone, for being on. This is a great day for American Airlines. We announced our second quarter financial results, as Dan said. A profit of $1.5 billion, excluding special charges. That's the best financial performance for any quarter in the long and proud history of American Airlines and by a wide margin. These results are due to the great work of our 100,000-plus team members who are coming together really well and doing a great job of taking care of our customers, and I want to be sure and thank all of them and congratulate all of them for these results.","So -- and then in addition to announcing our record earnings today, we announced a capital deployment program. The program includes over $2.8 billion in debt and aircraft lease payments, a $1 billion share repurchase plan, a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders and $600 million of pension contributions in 2014 beyond the required contribution. As part of the program, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share. This is the first cash dividend paid to American shareholders since 1980, and I think it's further evidence of a transformation underway at our airline and also within our industry.","So as I said, this is a great day for us. It's sometimes hard to remember that just less than 8 months ago, American was in bankruptcy and getting ready to emerge from bankruptcy through our merger with US Airways. Yet today, here we are reporting record profits, prepaying debt, making additional pension contributions and declaring dividends to shareholders. We are really proud of our team and what they've accomplished by working together in a very short period of time.","We're not done. There's a tremendous amount of work ahead, as we all know. And -- but what we do know is this performance is evidence that we're on the right track, and it gives us confidence as we move forward. And we are very much looking forward to continue to work together to restore American Airlines as the greatest airline in the world, and we're very happy to have -- to be on this track and to report these results.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to Derek and Scott.","Derek J. Kerr","All right. Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. In our earnings release and the 10-Q filed earlier today, you'll find information pertaining to our second quarter results. And as we talked about last quarter, please note that the GAAP results for the second quarter shown today compare our post-merger performance to that of legacy AMR Corp. on a stand-alone basis, and this makes the year-over-year comparisons not meaningful. As such, for the second quarter 2013, we have provided our financial results on a non-GAAP combined basis, which is the sum of American Airlines' and US Airways' results for the period. We believe this is the best way to review our quarterly financial results. Unless otherwise noted, all my comments will be based on the comparison to the 2013 non-GAAP-combined results, which can be found in the press release tables under the heading American Airlines Group Non-GAAP Combined Consolidated Statement of Operations.","As Doug said, for the quarter, the company recorded a GAAP record -- record GAAP net profit of $864 million. This compares non-GAAP combined second quarter 2013 net profit of $220 million. Excluding net special charges, we reported a record net profit of $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2014. This represents 114% improvement over the combined non-GAAP net profit, excluding special charges of $681 million for the same period in 2013. Using 734.8 million diluted shares outstanding, we reported earnings, excluding special charges, of $1.98 per diluted share for the second quarter; and our pretax margin, excluding net special charges, improved by 540 basis points year-over-year to 12.8%.","Total capacity for the second quarter of 2014 was 68.1 billion ASMs, up 3.1% for the same period in 2013. Mainline capacity for the quarter was 61 billion ASMs, up 3.5%. Regional capacity for the quarter was down 0.4% to 7.09 billion ASMs.","In the second quarter, we took delivery of 21 mainline aircraft and we retired 14 aircraft. We do plan to retire additional 54 aircraft, while taking 43 more new mainline aircraft for the remainder of 2014. On the regional side, we retired 14 aircraft and took delivery of 11. For the remainder of the year the company expects to take delivery of 20 CRJ9 aircraft at its wholly-owned subsidiary, PSA Airlines, as well as 12 Embraer 175 aircraft to be operated under a capacity purchase agreement with Republic. We also expect to retire another 24 Embraer 140 aircraft by the end of the year.","Second quarter total operating revenues were a record $11.4 billion, up 10.2% for the same period last year on a 3.1% increase in system capacity. Passenger revenues for the quarter were $9.9 billion, up 9.2% year-over-year, with yields up 6.5%. Cargo revenues were up 8.3% to $221 million due primarily to higher fuel -- freight volumes. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, up 20% year-over-year due to higher frequent flyer revenue, driven principally by our affinity card deal with Citibank announced in late 2013.","First, in the second quarter 2013, total PRASM was up 5.9% in the second quarter of 2014 to a record $0.1457. Total RASM in the second quarter was also a record at $0.1668, up 6.9% versus 2013, and Scott will go into more detail about the revenue performance.","The Airlines' operating expenses, excluding special items for the second quarter of 2014, were $9.7 billion, up 4.7% year-over-year. Mainline operating cost per ASM, excluding special items, was $0.1319, up 1.2% year-over-year due principally to higher salaries and benefit expense. Salaries and benefit costs were up 10.2% due primarily to the impact of merger-related labor contract cost increases.","Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes and hedges for the second quarter of 2014, was $3.02 per gallon versus $2.98 per gallon in the second quarter of 2013. During the quarter, the company monetized its remaining fuel hedges at a Brent equivalent price of $111 per barrel. This transaction resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $70 million and a net gain of approximately $49 million, which will be included in our fuel guidance over the next 4 quarters.","Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0855 in the second quarter of 2014, up 2.2%. Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding special items, was $0.158, which was 5.2% higher primarily due to contractual rate increases. Excluding special items and fuel, our consolidated CASM was up 2.5% in the second quarter of 2014.","We ended the quarter with $10.3 billion in total cash and investments, of which $882 million was restricted. The company also has an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1 billion. Approximately, $791 million of the company's unrestricted cash balance was held in Venezuelan bolivars valued at the weighted average applicable change rate of VEF 6.53 to $1.","During the second quarter, the company generated $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations and made $502 million in debt and capital lease payments. In addition, we prepaid $113 million of obligations associated with certain aircraft debt and $51 million of special facility revenue bond obligations, of which approximately $29 million were -- was reflected as debt on the balance sheet. We also purchased aircraft off of lease for approximately $630 million in the second quarter.","Doug mentioned in his opening remarks, our Board of Directors has authorized the commencement of a capital deployment program. The program has 3 key components. Debt and lease payments. Since the merger closed in 2013, the company has prepaid $420 million of aircraft debt and bond obligations. In addition, the company plans to prepay $480 million of special facility revenue bond obligations by the end of 2014. It is anticipated that these payments will represent a reduction of the company's debt going forward.","The company has also used $630 million of cash to purchase aircraft that were previously leased to the company, and anticipates utilizing an additional $370 million of cash in this manner through the remainder of 2014. In addition, this morning -- or yesterday afternoon, the company called for redemption of the remaining $900 million principal amount of the 7.5% senior notes due March 15, 2016. In total, these steps represent approximately $2.8 billion of prepayments that will be completed by the end of 2014.","The company also plans to make supplemental contributions of $600 million to its defined benefit plans in 2014. These contributions would be above and beyond the $120 million required contributions for 2014.","And also the company includes -- included a share repurchase program and the initiation of a quarterly dividend. The company's Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to be completed no later than December 31, 2015, and the Board also declared a dividend of $10 (sic) [ $0.10 ] per share for shareholders of record as of August 4, 2014. The dividend will be paid on August 18, 2014, and as Doug said, this is the first cash dividend declared at American Airlines since 1980.","Since the merger closed, the company has paid $737 million to reduced its shares outstanding by approximately 25 million. This includes payments of $561 million in payroll tax withholdings, primarily from employees in lieu of issuing shares of common stock, which reduced the number of shares expected to be issued under the plan by approximately 20 million. In addition, during the second quarter, the company utilized the cash settlement feature paying $176 million to redeem the remaining $22 million principal amount of US Airways Group's 7.75% convertible notes due in May 2014, which further reduced diluted shares outstanding by approximately 4 million shares.","Now turning to guidance, and Scott will speak more about this in his remarks. We have reduced our international capacity plans for the fourth quarter of 2014. We now expect overall system capacity to be up approximately 2.5%. Mainline is expected to be up approximately 2.5% in 2014, of which international capacity is expected to be up approximately 5%, which is down 1% from our previous guidance. And domestic capacity up approximately 1% for 2013. Regional capacity in 2014 is planned to be up 1% year-over-year, and the breakdown of ASMs for the remainder of the year is as follows: 61.8 billion in the third quarter, 58.2 billion in the fourth quarter, regional capacity is 7.33 billion in the third quarter and 7.31 billion in the fourth quarter.","Our CASM guidance takes into account the effects of the merger on our cost structure, including the anticipated synergy benefits and the impact of higher labor costs that were agreed to in connection with the merger. For the full year 2014, we're now forecasting mainline CASM x special items and fuel to be up 2% to 4% versus 2013. This is driven by the cost of new labor contracts, higher depreciation due to owned aircraft and higher maintenance cost due to engine overhauls, offset by realized synergies. By quarter, the third quarter and the fourth quarter are expected to be up 1% to 3%. The fourth quarter and full year CASM guidance was adjusted, up slightly, as a direct result of the decrease in the ASMs in the fourth quarter. We still believe full year 2015 CASM will grow less than inflation and be in the plus 1 to minus 1 range. Regional CASM is forecast to be up approximately 3% to 5% in 2014.","Using the July 17 fuel curve, we are forecasting mainline fuel to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.03. Our mainline fuel forecast breaks down by quarter. In the third quarter, $2.93 to $2.98. In the fourth quarter, $2.92 to $2.97. Using the midpoints of the guidance we have provided, we expect our third quarter pretax margin to improve by approximately 350 basis points year-over-year and to range between 10.5% to 12.5%.","Looking at CapEx. We'll forecast -- we focus the remainder of the year on integrating the airline, while also making important investments in our fleet, product and operations.","We're forecasting total cash CapEx to be approximately $2.1 billion in 2014. This includes non-aircraft CapEx of $880 million and net aircraft CapEx of $1.2 billion.","So in summary, while still early in our integration, we continue to be very pleased with the record financial results produced thus far, which will allow us to return cash to our shareholders earlier than anyone anticipated. These outstanding results, of course, wouldn't be possible without the hard work and dedication of all of our team members, and I'd like to thank them for their outstanding effort. We have taken a nice step forward in achieving our goal of restoring American to the world's greatest airline, and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the future.","With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","J. Scott Kirby","Thanks, Derek, and I'd like to start by thanking all the people of American Airlines for the great job they continue doing operationally during the second quarter in spite of the difficult weather challenges. We're still seeing large improvements in our operating statistics as we go through the difficult summer months.","On the revenue front, our second quarter PRASM was up 6%. The revenue environment remains strong throughout the quarter. We saw particular strength in our domestic network, with RASM up 8% year-over-year. Our Pacific RASM was up 11% even in the face of significant industry capacity growth. AA is benefiting from many actions that we're taking to close the gap in the Pacific that we've historically had against the much larger networks of our competitors, and as a result, we're experiencing outsized performance. Our Atlantic RASM was up 2%, a result that we felt quite good about given the significant industry capacity growth across the Atlantic and the continuing headwinds from the U.S. network switching alliances. Latin RASM was down 2% due partly to the World Cup in Brazil, which we believe reduced business demand while the World Cup was happening, and some vacation customers from Latin America substituted travel to Brazil for the World Cup instead of going to the U.S. for their normal vacations.","We're still making solid progress on our integration efforts and are pleased with the progress so far. Some of the second quarter integration highlights included that we harmonized most of our fees and our frequent flyer award structures; we launched the day-of-departure reciprocal upgrade program for AAdvantage and Dividend Miles customers; we co-located another 20 airports; we've now painted 240 aircraft in the new AA livery; we broke ground on our new operation center designed to house the world's largest airline; continued making good progress on our single-operating certificate; reached tentative agreement that have since been ratified with the IAM covering legacy U.S. mechanics, fleet service agents and mechanic training specialist.","We also feel really good about the early progress we're making on winning corporate business. While it's hard to give objective overall statistics, one of the things that we expected in the merger was large synergies in New York by combining the legacy AA presence in transcon and international markets with the US Airways shuttle and East Coast network, and we're already seeing those benefits with domestic New York PRASM up 16% in the second quarter and our Atlantic PRASM up 8% in the second quarter out of New York. Consistent with what we've said previously, all of our work we're doing leaves us even more confident that we'll be able to meet or exceed our prior synergy guidance.","Turning to the outlook going forward, we still feel quite good about the demand environment. Demand around the world remains strong with a few exceptions. The year-over-year comps are much more difficult moving into the third quarter. In last year's second quarter, consolidated AA PRASM was down 0.9% due mostly to the government sequestration last year, and it was up 3.4% in 3Q. So from that perspective, the comps get over 4 points more difficult year-over-year. Despite the challenging comps, the domestic environment remains strong and we expect domestic PRASM to be up mid-single digits.","In the Pacific, double-digit capacity growth from the industry and AA. In spite of that, we expect positive year-over-year PRASM. Industry capacity is also up significantly across the Atlantic. Demand as measured by revenue growth is strong but not strong enough to absorb close to 10% capacity growth, and so we expect a modest decline in trans-Atlantic PRASM.","In Latin America, the World Cup effects will extend into the second quarter and will have a large -- and will also have a large year-over-year impact from a reduction in services to Venezuela. Last year, as the black dollar-bolivar exchange rate began spiking in June, American Airlines revenues from Venezuela jumped significantly. In the third quarter of last year, Venezuela was only 0.5% of AA's system capacity, but would've been 2% of our total combined consolidated revenue. This year, we've canceled most of our Venezuela flying, so we'll be losing most of the 2% of revenue but only 0.5% of the ASMs, which means that our system PRASM in 3Q is negatively impacted by almost a full 1.5% just from canceling the Venezuelan services. When considering the fundamental demand environment, it's probably best to think about it excluding Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, we expect the rest of Latin America PRASM to be flat to down, but the Latin America entity, including Venezuela, will obviously be down much more.","At a system level, we expect PRASM to be up 2% to 4% in the third quarter, excluding Venezuela, but subtracting the 1.5 point hit from Venezuela means that we expect our reported PRASM will be up 1% to 3%. While international demand is strong, as measured by growth in revenue, it hasn't been growing fast enough to keep up with double-digit capacity growth rates, so we're taking action going forward to moderate some of the international capacity growth. Across the Atlantic, we'll be reducing our capacity for the remainder of the year by approximately 3% compared to our prior plan. In Latin America, for the remainder of 2014, we're planning to reduce our capacity by approximately 5% from our previous plans.","In conclusion, we're very encouraged with the operating and integrating -- integration results at the new American Airlines, and the demand environment remains strong, with the exception of our Venezuela exposure.","Daniel Cravens","Thanks, Derek. Thanks, Scott. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, just sort of big-picture question here. When I think about American as a stand-alone, it was seasonally more of a third quarter company. That's where we saw usually the top margins, the best profitability. US Airways was more of a second quarter company. You put the 2 together, how should we think about it? I mean, I know there are some puts and takes there. I mean, if I think back when we were going into the June quarter, you guys were guiding to, I think, a pretax margin of 10% to 12%. For the third quarter, you're guiding to a 10.5% to 12.5%, so it seems like maybe, when the dust is settled, maybe your still -- your third quarter is your better quarter than the June. Anything else going on there that may have some impact or beyond what I said?","J. Scott Kirby","Mike. I think when we combined American and US Airways, the second and third quarter are really close to the same in terms of seasonality. And actually, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance at 11.5% and if you added back the 1.5 point hit from Venezuela would have been a slightly higher margin than we had in the second quarter but in the same ballpark. So I think our seasonality, you would -- you should normally expect to be about the same in this case. We stopped service on July 1 to Venezuela, so we're taking a big hit from Venezuela in the third quarter. And that probably really explains the difference for this particular quarter.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then, just my second question. You mentioned that you would be getting out some Embraer, I think, 145s -- I think it was either 145s or 140s getting out of 24 this year. And presumably, if there are 145s, I guess, they're Eagle or Envoy Airplanes, maybe there's some Republic airplanes there as well. Longer term, what -- where do things stand now with Envoy? I know there was some back-and-forth about whether or not they were trying to get to a contract. What's the status on that right now? And going forward, as airplanes come in, I -- presumably, it sounds like they're going to be flown by other partners. Just give us an update. That'd be great.","J. Scott Kirby","Yes. At the moment, there's no change to the status. Envoy is still a very large and incredibly important partner for AA, though the new large regional jets are going elsewhere, at least the ones that are being delivered in the next 12 months or so. We remain hopeful that, at some point, we'll reach a deal with our pilots that allows us to put large regional jets there, but there is no change in the near term.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Scott, it's still difficult for me to reconcile how an airline that's starting to generate revenue synergies that you expressed confidence with outperforming industry RASM this year turns around and provides a RASM guide that's well below the competition. And I appreciate the Venezuela commentary, but presumably, you were aware of that phenomenon when you sounded such a bullish tone earlier in the year. So if you look towards the fourth quarter, is the Venezuela hit expected to be about the same, and do synergies start to recover that? Or put differently, and I'm not going to hold you to this, when, if ever, should we be expecting your RASM to recover and start the industry outperformance that the merger all along would've suggested was feasible?","J. Scott Kirby","Well, look, I think if you look excluding Venezuela at our performance as we're going forward, one, at a system level, our guidance is the same as Delta and United for RASM, and that's despite much bigger exposure to the rest of Latin America, which is going to be the worst region in the world, and despite the fact that we have higher capacity growth. I mean, further, if you look at kind of entity by entity in the second quarter and I think in the third quarter, we outperformed the industry. We underperformed across the Atlantic, which we've said all along, we expected to do that. This year, as we switched alliances, we've outperformed by a wide margin across the Pacific, and in spite of the Venezuela exposure, we've actually outperformed even 2 Latin America. So I think we already are outperforming. We'll continue to outperform. When you roll everything together at a system level, you missed some of those nuances that just is where we're flying individually and the fact that Latin America is weak is going to hurt us in the third quarter. The Venezuela situation is going to also hurt in the fourth quarter. It's actually larger in the fourth quarter. It'll be almost a full 2 points in the fourth quarter, but then it moderates and essentially goes to 0 as we move into next year. I mean, really, on Venezuela, what happened last year is the black market bolivar rate spiked from -- to about 60 per dollar from the official exchange rate of 6.3. And what the government -- what we were allowed to do is you could buy airline tickets but they were at the official exchange rate of 6.3, so you were buying them at a 90% discount to the black market rate. And further, you're allowed to convert 3,000 -- you convert bolivars at the 6.3 rate into $3,000 of cash, and so you could buy your ticket in Venezuela and go to the U.S. and make money because of the differential in the exchange rate. And so just everyone was buying tickets, you'd wind up selling out every flight to the highest inventory class. One of the, I think, remarkable statistics is, we have 1 -- had 1 flight a day between Caracas and San Juan. We had 6 flights a day between Miami and San Juan. 30% of the revenue on the Miami-San Juan flights last year was people leaving Caracas going to and from -- just because it was -- any way you could get out of Venezuela, you could make money and actually put dollars in your pocket to leave Venezuela. So it just had an outsized effect. And I think we already are outperforming, I think we'll continue to outperform, I think that outperformance can accelerate, but we've got 1.5 point hit this quarter and a 2 point hit next quarter, but they're not merger-related.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. But Scott, are you assuming that there's no replacement RASM associated with whatever capacity was displaced from Brazil -- from Venezuela? Did you just hit it down or these figures net of whatever RASM you picked up putting those planes elsewhere?","J. Scott Kirby","Well, there is replacement RASM. And so that's included my numbers when I say less than 1.5%. But when you had legs that had RASM that was 4x the system average, which is what Venezuela was, RASM during that -- during the third quarter. Again it's just because you wind up selling an awful lot of tickets at the very highest fares but they were priced cheaply in bolivars. And when you did that, you wind up with RASM that was 4x the system average. And so, yes, you can replace that, but it comes in at something less than the system average, and that's how you wind up with a 1.5 point hit.","Operator","And we'll take our question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","I'm sorry, I may have missed this if you said this earlier, but did you say 2015 CASM x fuel be down 1 to up 1 2015?","Derek J. Kerr","2015, yes. I mean, we believe that we've had questions before of do you believe -- where do you believe it can go in 2015. And basically, with the synergies that we have and where we go, we're looking at it to be lower than inflation growth and in the flat range.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, great. And does that imply 2% to 3% capacity growth as well, roughly?","Derek J. Kerr","We haven't given out the capacity growth for next year yet because we're still doing that for the plan, but it would be in that range, yes.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, helpful. And I heard you guys say Maya is there. Are you guys -- is she able to chat for a minute?","Daniel Cravens","She is.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Maya, a lot of people don't know you. You're driving the integration from the IT side, and I know, from where we sit, it looks like you're doing a pretty good job. And I was wondering if you could sort of help us out, think about sort of some of the benchmarks that we can see externally from the investor community what you're working on now. Res system cutover is still a long way away, but what are some of the benchmarks that we should be looking for in the near term that you're working on, you and your team? And second to that as well is, what kind of sort of leeway do you have as you're integrating the systems when you find things that you think are suboptimized, what kind of leeway you have to make changes now versus just picking what's good enough for the time being and punting it until a later date?","Maya Leibman","Well, thank you for saying that I'm driving the integration. Please keep telling Doug that. I think from an external standpoint, the things that you and our customers will see in the near term probably surround the frequent flyer program. We have made a lot of small changes with respect to that. So for example -- and on the website, so things that our frequent flyers can see when they come to the website. For example, the ability to earn and burn miles regardless of which carrier they're traveling. So if you're an AAdvantage member, you can earn AAdvantage miles when you're traveling on legacy US Airways metal. In addition, a lot of things around how you use the functionality in the website. So you can -- if you come to the -- to aa.com but you have a legacy US Airways ticket, you will -- and you come to check in, you will be gracefully taken over to the legacy US Airways check-in system, you will complete your check-in and then be returned to aa.com. So there's a lot of things that we've done, absent having full integration of the systems, to make the customer experience better. And I think if you benchmark those against what United and Delta and others have done at this point in the merger, you'll find that it's comparable, or in some cases, a little bit ahead.","As we look forward, there's also a lot of things I should mention that are happening behind the scenes. For example, we're working on things that you will never see like the integration of the revenue accounting systems. And a lot of the products, both airlines brought to this merger about 700 systems, so collectively, we have about 1,400 when both of us were running pretty big enterprises on just 700 systems each. So we need to get back down to something. So there's a lot of things that are happening behind the scenes right now to get back down to that footprint.","As far as your other question, we have a lot of leeway to make decisions right now about what positions us best for the future, and we are -- we're making those decisions each day. In general, we have decided to go with the legacy American Airlines systems because that's really the path of least resistance. These systems are generally larger. They're better able to scale, we have fewer employees to train and fewer customers to train and that's the direction that we're going to take. But as everyone has said, the real heavy-lifting happens next year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","You addressed my main one, which is trying to get you to talk about '15 CASM but that's already out of the box here. Just in terms of merger synergies, we'll stay on that theme if we think about fleet arbitrage mixing and matching U.S. fleet in AA network and vice versa. How far along are you in ramping those synergies, and what is the run rate today?","J. Scott Kirby","Well, we've made decent progress on it, but really, those kinds of synergies of mixing and matching the fleet. We're doing our first route swaps start on August 19. Well, actually, they've already started -- they started in July. So it's really early, and the big dollar values for those won't come for another year until we get to a single operating certificate because the biggest values are widebodies. And while we may do some of those, it's just hard to do it when they're 2 separate fleets. The customer issues and the other issues make it hard to do fully. So those are the ones that will take the longest to ramp up and really won't start in earnest until after we get to a single operating certificate.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Doug, I asked this question of one sort of smaller network carrier and one non-network carrier, and as a larger carrier, maybe you can comment on this. The TSA fee went up pretty much a lot. There's a lot of stuff going on with segment fees and so on, on -- and that fee went up July 21. Are you finding or able to pass that on to -- I mean, it's only been a couple of days, recognizing that. Are you able to pass it onto your customers? When you think going forward the impact, if any, will be?","William Douglas Parker","Look, Helane, we always talk about these fees and taxes. We're never able to pass them on. The airline works -- our airline, as all do, work really hard to generate as higher revenue as we can and maximize revenue and do anything we can to keep our cost down to produce profit. But it's not as though all of a sudden our costs go up and you see all the fares go up because that has impacts on demand. So I don't know, and Scott can probably talk a little more specifically, but I don't -- I can't imagine we would tell you, \"Oh yes, we've seen increases related to changes in this tax.\" What I can tell you is, the shift and how it's charged now is, certainly, I think a better way to assess this fee by having it -- rather than being per enplanement, per -- it essentially just goes to each time someone goes through the -- through security as opposed to every time you go onto an airplane. So that, we think, is a better way. It certainly shifts some of that burden away from the network carriers to those -- when we have connections that are -- that just -- that don't have as many connections. But look, at the end of the day, this is -- it's an additional tax to the industry yet again. It's just one that's been, in this case, being borne more by those who don't have connections than those that do.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of questions here. With respect to the 215 -- 2015 CASM, on the down 1% to up 1%, just to clarify, was that specifically nonfuel CASM or CASM? I was kind of getting pulled in different directions. And then...","Derek J. Kerr","No, nonfuel.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Nonfuel. And then, I guess, I was just wondering related to that what are some of the cost categories that might be offsetting natural inflation. Or should we just be thinking of it as general efficiency more ASMs absorbing sort of your general cost structure?","Derek J. Kerr","Yes, I would say more efficiencies and synergies coming in in 2015.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it. Okay. And then just circling back on the capacity to your producing it by 3% versus the prior plan and reducing Latin American 5% versus the prior plan. When will the cuts be uploaded to the schedules data? Are they already there? And when do these cuts phase in exactly? And I guess, just lastly, tied to that, what was the plan initially? Is it really what's in the schedules today? And do we just take it off for that?","William Douglas Parker","They're not in the system yet. I'm not sure of the exact date could be in the system. They start some of them as early as the back half of August, and some of those will be a day a week kind of cancellations that we're going to put in place. We were planning across the Atlantic about 5%, I think. And this will get us down to about 2%. And to Latin America, it was about 5%, and it'll get us down to flat.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it. And then, I guess, Scott just tied to that, your partner British Airways, of course, is growing pretty aggressive. I think they're growing 9%. What kind of coordination do you have with British Airways at this point? And have they commented on their plans looking ahead to this winter?","J. Scott Kirby","They have not yet commented, but they have an earnings call next Friday, and I suspect they will comment on their capacity plans at that time. And we have, at least, in the last 6 months I think started to develop a pretty close working relationship. SkyTeam has been at this longer and has I think a more mature working relationship where they really do sit there and jointly and work on capacity and revenue management issues. And we have started with IAG. It's not just British Airways that's also Iberia and Finnair. But we have started that a little bit behind, but I think we're ramping up pretty quickly. And I think as we move into 2015, you'll see a much more consolidated view on capacity -- more clearly it's a consolidated view on capacity and we will have worked toward together jointly to develop those plans. For the cuts that we're doing in the back of the year actually worked pretty closely with IAG on those as well, but you'll see more of that in 2015 and think that is an opportunity for both of our companies.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Derek, just in a context of a lot of these balance sheet-related announcements and the capital returns plan, I was hoping you might lay out, maybe, some longer-term metrics or ways of thinking about both the debt balance, the minimum cash balance, long-term thought processes around capital returns to investors, whatever you're willing to offer just as we do our longer-term modeling, this is clearly a major change and a great one for the company.","William Douglas Parker","John, this is Doug. I'll start a little and then Derek can chime in. I mean, look, our goal is to maximize return on investment capital, to maximize profitability, not to say that we don't have projections and targets that we want to go hit, but we're reluctant to go give targets because a bit of a concern is that under -- that doesn't push as hard as we should be going. And we can do even better than just hitting a target and then suggesting, once we get there, we're going to do something differently then try to produce the best results we possibly can. So what you see from us today, I think, is indicative of what you should expect to see, which is an airline that knows that we have a lot of work to do in terms of getting the integration done, understands it's going to take some capital, understands that we need if we're going to go build the greatest airline like we plan to, we need to make sure that we're taking care of our people, taking care of our customers, and also taking care of our investors. And to the extent we do that in the term and we have enough cash to do -- to take care of our customers and our employees that our job is to return it to investors both debt and shareholders. And what I expect is, you'll see us do more and more of this over time, and this isn't a one-off situation. I think this really is an indication of how transformed this business is that we're all confident enough to be doing things like this and we'll keep doing more and more than that. But our goal is to be doing better this than anybody else. And so like I say, rather than giving you set margin targets and set return on capital targets, our goal is just to go be higher than anybody else.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful color. And just on a separate topic, Doug and maybe Scott. There was -- when we think about the kind of synergy outlook over the next couple of years, there was this sort of initial bucket of low-hanging fruit that you identified earlier in the year, an overbooking model, re-banking of some hubs which I know are still in front of us. I was just hoping that you could update us maybe on the more near-term timeline for what's rolled on, what still has to roll on, as we're kind of bridging this gap before a lot of the really hard work on integration occurs deeper into 2015.","William Douglas Parker","Well, on the things that we talked about earlier, there are 3 big ones. One is putting more seats on the airplane. That has started, but not a lot done. The 787s haven't even started yet. Really, that's something that will be happening starting in earnest at the end of the summer and going through -- all the way through the end of 2015 actually to get the whole fleet done. Second, the thing we identified was re-banking the hubs. The first hub to be re-banked is Miami, that will go into effect August 19. So clearly, none of that's in the numbers yet. Dallas and Chicago will go into effect, we're currently targeting the end of March of next year. And then the third one is variable scheduling, which is pulling some capacity out of peaks and flying more in the peaks. That really hasn't started at all yet and will start in the fourth quarter this year, although it'll only be in its infancy. So certainly won't be fully at steady state. So those are the 3 things that we talked about and really none of those have kicked in in earnest yet, but they are coming. There are lot of smaller things that we have already done that I don't think we've talked about on earnings calls, but bag fees and other things that are already flowing through in the numbers. So there's a lot of things that are in the numbers, but the big ones that we've talked about in the earnings calls haven't started yet.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And it sounds like fourth quarter is a big quarter for that. And is the annual -- annualized impact still this kind of hundreds of millions of dollar kind of number that you disclosed earlier in the year? Or has it gone up for one reason or another?","William Douglas Parker","Well, everything that we -- we haven't changed the number in our official guidance, but everything we've done makes us feel increasingly confident that we'll achieve or exceed those numbers, but we haven't officially changed the guidance.","William Douglas Parker","John, it's Doug again. There's one point that you asked and I missed that come back and get to --- anyway I think it's important someone interesting, which is the leverage ratios. That's another -- that's one of these again where, certainly we want to work to given where the balance sheet now is to de-lever and you're seeing us do some of that in the announcement today. But it's also really important, I think, to understand, that in our business, if you simply just go target leverage ratios or credit ratings, you'd be making some really inefficient decisions for your company. And that's due to the fact that aircraft debt, that's which is the vast majority of all of airline debt, because of -- at least today, you can get so incredibly efficiently through WTC, certainly the A and B tranches, that because the airplanes, of course, can be moved and therefore very little to do with the underlying credit of the company and a lot to do with the fact with the asset itself. So anyway, if all you're doing is targeting the credit ratio -- debt-to-equity ratio, you'd be doing -- we -- it would encourage to do things like take cash for aircraft, which may not be in the best interest of the firm at all. Because as we de-lever that way and the credit rating goes down, nothing happens to our cost of capital. Indeed, it doesn't change a bit, and we're not providing -- and we're able to borrow at rates below our cost of capital. So anyway, another one of these things. Just another indication that I -- if it's not clear, we're not the biggest fans of setting targets for the sake of setting targets. We have -- we know what our job is, and we're going to do it and plan to do it really well. And we'll produce results, but we're not going to try and run the company for debt-to-equity ratios or anything other than just being the best we possibly can be and things like on return on capital.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Well, it's been working so far.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joe DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Derek, I'm wondering if you could just given all the debt reduction efforts here, if you could just put into context kind of with that -- without setting a target obviously, what that puts the interest expense line kind of looking like next year or if you have a longer-term thought on where you want it to be.","Derek J. Kerr","Well, I think from -- we have a guidance ready now that interest expense is going to be about $855 million for this year. So that's the guidance that's out there today. That all depends on exactly what Doug just talked about is, what are we going to do, we have a fair amount of aircraft coming in, and we have a fair amount of unencumbered aircraft today. So it depends on what financing activities we will do in the near future. So having it -- I think what you'll see is, because of us having capital commitments of over $5 billion worth of aircraft coming in for the next few years, you'll see the debt level stay pretty much the same, but you'll see a lower cost of capital as we're able to finance at better opportunity. So if I took that equation, you'd say it would be less than it was this year and driven down from an interest expense basis, but driven more down by rate than it's driven by debt reduction.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on the Latin America, I just wanted to get a sense of where you're seeing the weakness. Is it concentrated in Brazil or any specific region outside of the reductions that are, obviously, happening in Venezuela?","William Douglas Parker","Fairly, Venezuela was the worst region. The worst part of Latin America. Then Argentina, I think, is probably second and has some macroeconomic weakness. Brazil has been weak, but I think that's largely a World Cup effect. And we've actually seen all of Latin America in a couple of weeks following the end of the World Cup actually start to bounce back. And the rest of Latin America -- the rest of South America is pretty strong. The Caribbean and Mexico are actually, on a revenue basis, quite strong, but there is huge capacity and growth in some of those markets. Markets like Cancun, Montego Bay with capacity up 25%. So RASM will be down in those markets, but revenue growth is 20%. So those markets are strong. Really, Venezuela -- Argentina is a little weak. Brazil is a little weak, but Venezuela is the real story in Latin America, overwhelms everything else.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then just closer to your home, I know as you go to the fourth quarter it seems like that there is a lot of capacity just being added to both the [indiscernible] DC markets as well as Dallas because of the slot gains by some carriers and then DFW with Wright Amendment. What are you seeing early stages on kind of the on fares and the impact of these capacity increases?","William Douglas Parker","It's really too early for us to see any impact. We don't see anything on our numbers yet that's identifiable, but we know there will be an impact from both of those. I think the Wright Amendment impact will probably be larger than in D.C. But we aren't seeing anything yet. It's 3 months before Southwest -- before the Wright Amendment goes away, so it's just really too early in the booking curve to tell anything.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And as with -- in Dallas, are there other markets that you've added that maybe help offset the impact there or?","William Douglas Parker","Well, what I think what we're going to be impacted in some of the Dallas local markets. I think we'll still do quite well, and Dallas is a fantastic hub. We'll still do really well in the markets that we serve. We're going to have a much better pattern of service really in all of those markets for frequent customers, which they care about, we have a much better frequent flier program, which the elite and frequent traveling business customers care about and we're going to compete aggressively with Southwest, but just when you add more capacity in any market, it obviously has some impact. We have grown DFW a little, although our biggest growth is actually with lot of ASMs has been new service to Shanghai and Hong Kong, but we aren't explicitly trying to replace markets or anything. We're going to compete with the strength of our great frequent flier base and one of the best hubs in the world, great customer base, and that's what we're going to compete with.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What are your thoughts on forming strategic financial partnerships with other carriers, for example, in Asia, where you're building out your franchise? Obviously, you know one of your competitors has done that and seems to have been beneficial both financially and operationally in particular to Lat Am. So be curious as to how you're thinking about your Pacific strategy in terms of growing and building it to over the medium term.","William Douglas Parker","Well, we already have a great joint venture partnership with JAL, and we believe that they are a fantastic partner. To the extent of there are opportunities to add others to that, we're open to it. And we think about it and talk about it. Nothing we're going to -- no specifics that we're going to talk about on the conference call, but it's something that we want to do jointly with a good partner that we already have in Asia.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, yes, just switching topics. On the single op certificate, can you give us an update as to the timing? I know that you said it would take roughly about a year or so. Is it sort of first half next year or second half? And can you just post on in terms of how that's -- those discussions are progressing?","Robert D. Isom","This is Robert Isom, Chief Operating Officer. We're making great progress and working very cooperatively with the FAA. We have the single operating certificate process really broken down into 9 chunks. And we're kind of midway through the process right now. Based on the timing right now, we would expect sometime late second quarter or shortly thereafter to be in position to work with the FAA and getting single operating certificate.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And when that happens, how long will it take for us to start seeing the operational impact with the improved synergies, we think of soft metal and staffing?","Robert D. Isom","Well, the good thing about the single operating processes is that we'll see benefits all along the way. It's not going to be like a light switch. That said though, there are a number of things that really touch back to what Maya had talked about earlier. They're really dependent on when we can get our systems aligned. And as Maya had said, getting to a single reservation system. That's something that's late next year, hopefully. And that will really facilitate a lot of getting our groups together at the airports and facilitating a lot of the other work that we can do in a more efficient manner.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So can -- I guess, can you just help us frame the opportunities that across the Pacific? And I guess, I'll refrain from asking for a target. But you're underrepresented in the region. So just wondering if you can quantify in terms of how much you think you can profitably grow the Pacific region, as maybe as a percentage of total system capacity? And then, whether or not you think you need to buy more wide-body aircraft in order to get there?","William Douglas Parker","Well, to start, we have an awful lot of wide-body aircraft on order. And that there is growth contemplated in the wide-body order to China. So I don't think we need to buy more airplanes to Asia to do that. I think that there are profitable opportunities in Asia. We don't have a target. And aren't going to set one. Our growth will be predicated on making the existing flying we have and the new routes that we've added profitable, which will give us the confidence to continue growing and adding new routes. But we're going to be focused on making what we currently have successful, and once that's successful I think that gives you the ability to grow and so growth will be not on a target, but will be dependent on how well we do in the region.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So no really view on how big that might be. Just maybe, I'll try another one. On your labor costs, I think you characterized this synergy here as $400 million as that steps up. But when I look at your labor cost and add $400 million to it per ASM, that's still kind of 15-ish percent below Delta and United on a per ASM basis. So I just wondering if maybe you can help us reconcile what that reported labor cost number looks like versus your peers and what sort of the biggest differences you think there are between you guys and your nearest peers.","William Douglas Parker","I think we'd have to take some time to try to reconcile that with you. I've never heard of anyone talking about labor cost per ASM. It's just -- it's not terribly -- it's not the right metric. If you have 138 seats on an A350 and pay your pilots exactly the same as someone else that flies with the 150 seats on an A350, you have 9% difference in labor cost per ASM, even though your labor cost is exactly the same. So we look at labor cost block hour by equipment type. And so I think we have to do something more detailed to reconcile with you. I think we do think our costs are a little below where others are and moving to get to the same levels as the other as we complete the integration and have profitability that's -- profitability potential that's equivalent to an airline like Delta. But I think the 15% number is wrong, and it's probably because you're looking at it on an ASM basis.","Operator","This now concludes the analysis portion of the question-and-answer session. We will now conduct the media portion of the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ely -- I'm sorry, David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","I wanted to ask a Tel Aviv question. And the very simple, was there -- was this a -- the resumption of flights, was this a joint decision? Did all 3 of the U.S. carriers decide, one for all, all for one, if one of us is going to go back, we're all going to go back in there?","William Douglas Parker","Robert?","Robert D. Isom","David, no. The fact of the matter is, we've been evaluating the situation in Tel Aviv for some time. We do all the time. And of course, the precursor to resuming service was the pull down of the NOTAM by the FAA, which was done last night. We reviewed the situation and are pleased to fly our scheduled service that's going out tonight. And of course, the security and safety of our passengers and our employees are first and foremost. And we evaluate internal, external sources, as well as working with the government to make the decision to do what's right.","William Douglas Parker","And this is Doug, David. We obviously, as always Robert just; said, we make independent decisions as do they. Although it shouldn't be surprising that we all came to the same conclusion. This is a really competitive business. But we don't compete on safety. And we -- none of us would do anything that we thought was remotely had put any of our employees or customers at risk. And we've all been working with the FAA and we're working with each other and everyone has come to conclusion that is entirely safe. And if we hadn't come to that conclusion, the others wouldn't conclude it either because we don't have -- there are no degrees of this amongst the industry. We all put it as our top priority, and no one is more adamant about than anyone else. It's top of mind for everyone's business. So it doesn't surprise me at all when we came to same conclusion because the facts are the same.","David Koenig","Yes, understood about the safety. I just wondered did you all talk before you -- as you developed your decisions.","William Douglas Parker","Absolutely not. It's possible, of course, that others might have come to different conclusions with different facts, so we wouldn't have -- we would not have decided to go if we didn't think it was perfectly safe independently.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ely Portillo with The Charlotte Observer.","Ely Portillo","So you guys mentioned in your earnings release specifically the 4 new flights to Europe from Charlotte and the seasonal service. I was just wondering if you can give any details on how those are doing and whether you think those will make it for: a, their full length; and b, next year, given these less aggressive Atlantic -- Transatlantic expansion you're talking about.","William Douglas Parker","Well, I'm not going to give specific route commentary, but given the double-digit capacity growth across the Atlantic, it's pressured all routes, and new routes are generally the most marginal routes, so they've been under more pressure. So they've underperformed what we'd hoped they do, that doesn't mean they won't come back next year. But they've underperformed not because the routes are done poorly, but just because there's been 10% capacity growth across the Atlantic at an industry level.","Ely Portillo","Another thing that I noticed in yours and your competitors' releases was load factors continuing to increase especially domestically. Have you guys gotten any negative feedback from passengers? Do you have any concerns about that, hitting a wall going forward? Or is there still room to grow load factor?","J. Scott Kirby","Well, our goal to be run 100% load factor. But I don't know of any feedback that's anything different than normal about load factor. I think we are probably near what is a structural peak because busy flights are 100% full, but then you have flights like the shuttle markets that run at 50% load factors, and you're never get turnout the shuttle market into a 100% load factor. So you have seasonal issues, early flights, late flights. So I think we're probably near a peak. And load factors really aren't growing. In fact, I think, ours maybe even a bit down slightly in the quarter.","Ely Portillo","Yes, I think your overall was, but your domestic was up.","William Douglas Parker","I think we're near a peak on what's achievable on load factors.","Derek J. Kerr","I'll just add, Ely, I think the high load factors in themselves our feedback from customers and that means is when there's a lot of demand for the product and there are a lot of people that want to fly and we are happy to meet that need.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mary Grace Lucas with CNN.","Mary Grace Lucas","Back to Tel Aviv just briefly, can you guys just talk about internal discussion that you had over the flight, and how insurance plays into it, and how also you sort of factor safety in that question? What details can you give us about how you discuss a decision like this?","Robert D. Isom","Mary, it's Robert again. Again, this is not the first time that we've dealt with a situation in a region of the world or someplace that we fly. We constantly monitor any threats in the system, whether they'd be civil unrest or issues with thunderstorms, or at the end of the day, things that may be related to FAA mandates. So we are on constant alert, and we have our own internal security group that monitors all situations. We have external advisors. And then of course, we have a government relations team that stays in close contact with the State Department, with the FAA and a number of other government agencies. We collect all that information and at various levels within the company, analyze and use that information ultimately to make recommendations on what's best. Now of course, the work doesn't stop there. We're certainly mindful of our customers and our employees. But you know, we're also very concerned about our pilots and flight attendants that they fly these routes, and we consult with them and the labor unions as well to make sure that we're all coordinated when we make decisions. Exactly the process we went through this time is process we'll go through again. And we're set up to do that on a regular basis.","Mary Grace Lucas","But as speaking -- as generally speaking, more about this particular instance, can you talk about some of the internal discussion that you had? And also, can you prove that flights are safer today than they were yesterday? How can you be sure?","Robert D. Isom","Mary, again, I went through the process that we go through. And again, we get information and we have very good sources and of course the government as well. That's how we go about making our decisions. So we feel very comfortable with the information that we have right now, that we're doing the right thing and feel very confident that our employees and our customers are safe.","Mary Grace Lucas","Was there any one factor that changed from yesterday, today -- to today that had a heavy influence on this decision, other than the pull down of the NOTAM.","Robert D. Isom","Yes, the NOTAM was pulled, Mary, and that's about all that we want to talk about it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","[indiscernible] sort of carrying things a bit with the weakness in some of the international areas. I wanted to ask you, if you look out, at least into the near-term future, is there anything that you see that might threaten that domestic strength? I mean, in terms of the economy? Or fuel prices? Or anything like that? Or do you expect it to continue strong for some time?","William Douglas Parker","Well, there's nothing that we see. As far out as we can see, we expect the domestic environment to remain strong. And I would even say the international environment is strong. When you look out, you have 10% capacity growth across the Pacific. We have even higher capacity growth and we're going to have RASM up. That's huge revenue growth. It was across the Atlantic where you've got 10% capacity growth, and we're going to have RASM down slightly, but that means revenue and demand is growing close to double digits. Really, the only part of the world where there's weakness is Venezuela, at least significant weakness. And I don't see anything that's going to change it domestically. You rarely see these things coming in advance, but it feels pretty good right now.","Mary Schlangenstein","All right. And can I kind of ask, in a newsletter to employees, Doug talked about the wide bodies that will be coming in the future and that you may use them for some international growth versus replacement. And you mentioned that earlier. Do you have ideas already where you're going to place some of the planes, I mean, where you see your future longer-term growth? Will we see you go into some new countries or anything like that?","William Douglas Parker","Yes. We have a long list of potential markets that we've looked at and that we think are going to be good growth potentials, but we constantly -- and some of those are new countries and some of those are new cities and some of those are new routes to existing cities that we already serve. But we constantly adjust that based on what's happening in the demand environment, so we can't announce anything yet until we get to the point where we actually ready to load those flights. We do think that over the long-term, there are international growth opportunities. I think in the short- to medium-term, we need to have some time to let demand catch up with the capacity. Again, demand is strong, but capacity growth has been even higher. We need to let demand catch up with capacity before pursuing some of those growth opportunities, but there's a lot out there that we're going to have over the coming years.","Operator","This now concludes the question-and-answer session.","Derek J. Kerr","Okay. All right. Thank you, everyone, for your interest. Any further questions, please let us know, but we are now adjourned. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","This concludes the presentation.

And welcome to the Fourth Quarter American Airlines Group earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference maybe recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Cravens, Managing Director Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.","Dan Cravens","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for our Q&A session are several of our senior exes, including Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.","Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the fourth quarter and provide some additional information on our 2019 guidance. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions, and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast or capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can also be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will be archived on the Web site, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us. At this point, I would like to the turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Dan. Thanks everyone. We reported fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings this morning. For 2018, we had pretax profit excluding special items of $2.8 billion for the year. 2018 was a challenging year for us financially, higher fuel prices per gallon drove an increase in our total fuel expense by $2.2 billion versus 2017, and that led to about $1.4 billion reduction in our pretax earnings. I guess we had difficult operations environment during the summer. But we entered 2019 with the great momentum and excitement. Derek and Robert will cover this in lot more detail, but we are dedicated in improving our operations liability and that work has already taken hold, and we are excited about how we will perform going throughout 2019. We have over $1 billion of revenue and cost initiatives that are well underway that we know are going to help us to improve our earnings in 2019 versus '18. We're growing where we have a competitive advantage, thanks in large part to our ability to grow our largest job in Dallas-Fort Worth. And we are nearing the end of our unprecedented post merger capital expenditure, capital requirements which Derek will talk a little more about.","So we feel great about where we are positioned. Our teams are doing a great job. And we couldn't be more proud of the work they are doing to take care of our customers. And we are really looking forward to 2019. Consistent with that optimism, we provided some 2019 EPS guidance this morning that has -- Derek can talk more about it, so there's relatively wide range but the middle of that range would have our EPS up about little over 40% higher than what we announced for 2018.","So with that said, I'll turn over to Derek to give you a lot more detail.","Derek Kerr","Thanks Doug and good morning everybody. I'd like to start by recognizing our team who did a great job of taking care of our customers during the busy holiday travel period. Despite challenging weather conditions in some of our hubs, the preparation and teamwork of our operations group was evident and it made a real difference for our customers. So from all of us, I want to thank you all for all your efforts.","We filed our fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 earnings press release this morning. While fuel prices fell during the quarter, our average fuel cost per gallon was 17.5% higher than the same period last year. Excluding net special items, we reported a fourth-quarter net profit of $481 million in 2018 versus 2017 fourth-quarter net profit of $444 million. For the full year, our net income, excluding net special items, was $2.1 billion, down 18% versus 17% on a 29% increase in average fuel price.","Our diluted earnings per share, excluding net special items in the fourth quarter was $1.04 per share, up from $0.93 per diluted share in the fourth quarter last year. And for the full year of 2018, our earnings per diluted share excluding net special items was $4.55. Our fourth quarter pretax profit excluding net special items was $634 million with a pretax margin of 5.8%. And on a full-year basis also excluding net special items, we earned pretax income of $2.8 billion on a pretax margin of 6.3%.","The fourth quarter of 2018 was American Airlines' ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year total operating revenue growth, which was up 3.1% to $10.9 billion. This represents the highest fourth quarter total operating revenue in American Airlines' history. For the full year, total operating revenues were also a record, up 4.5% to $44.5 billion. On a unit revenue basis, total RASM was up 1.7% for the fourth quarter and up 2.4% for the year. This growth was driven by the continued enhancements of our revenue management system, as well as the positive impact of our basic and premium economy products, which help drive 2.9% improvement in passenger revenues for the fourth quarter to $10 billion.","For the year, total passenger revenue was up 3.9% to $40.7 billion. Our cargo team finished the year with an excellent fourth quarter, increasing revenues by 3% or $264 million. This growth was due primarily to higher cargo yields. And for the first time ever, our cargo revenue exceeded $1 billion for the full year. So congratulations to the cargo team. They worked hard to reach this milestone and we look forward to growing this segment of our business in 2019 and beyond.","We\u2019ve seen strength in our loyalty program all year and that trend continued in the fourth quarter, driving other revenues higher by 6.3% to $712 million for the quarter. Full year 2018 other revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 9.7%. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $10.4 billion, up 4.2% due primarily to 19.6% increase in consolidated fuel expense. For the full year 2018, fuel costs were up nearly 32% or $2.4 billion, which drove 9.1% increase in total annual operating expenses. When fuel and special items are excluded, our unit costs decreased in the fourth quarter by 0.2% compared to 2017. This was due in part to the success of our one-airline cost initiatives. This project gained momentum during the year and as a result, our full year 2018 CASM, excluding fuel and special items, was up only 1.4% as compared to the projected increase of 2% that was guided to at the beginning of the year. It's worth noting that we were able to beat our unit cost projections despite lowering our capacity growth by more than 50 basis points from our initial expectations at the beginning of the year.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.6 billion in total available liquidity. During the quarter, our treasury team completed several transactions, including upsizing and expanding our existing $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, while improving the undrawn economics. We have committed financing for all mainline aircraft deliveries through June 2019, and continue to evaluate financing options for our remaining mainline and regional aircraft deliveries in 2019.","In 2018, we made contributions of $467 million to our defined benefit pension plans. For 2019, we now intend to make contributions of $800 million, up slightly from the $780 million that we projected in our last earnings call. Rising interest rates have helped our pension liability and brought it down by $1.4 billion. However, the sell-off in risk assets in the fourth quarter resulted in negative asset return for the year, driving the increased contribution in order to maintain our desired funding status for all of our plans.","During 2018, we lowered our adjusted debt including pensions by approximately $760 million. We anticipate our 2019 year-end adjusted debt will be lower by more than $1 billion compared to year end 2018. Over the next few years this trend is planned to continue as we pay down our existing obligations, and our new aircraft deliveries slowed significantly after 2019. During the quarter, we did adapt early the new lease accounting standard, which requires leases to be recognized on the balance sheet as liabilities with corresponding right of use assets. That early adoption of this standard benefited pretax income excluding net special items in the fourth quarter by $54 million. Of which a significant portion relates to prior quarters in 2018. We will recast 2018 quarters for the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in our 2018 10-K filing.","We did not purchase any stock during the quarter of 2018, leaving our available authorization for stock buybacks unchanged at $1.65 billion. We continue to believe our stock is undervalued. Unfortunately, the fall of oil prices, which improved our liquidity outlook at the end of the year occurred during a close trading window. And as a result, we were unable to resume stock repurchases during the fourth quarter despite ending the quarter at $600 million above our threshold. However, our plan is still to return excess cash above our $7 billion liquidity threshold to our shareholders as we have done in the past.","We filed our Investor Relations update this morning, which includes our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019. We anticipate our capacity will grow approximately 3% during 2019 with growth of approximately 1% in the first quarter. The full year capacity growth will come primarily from incremental flying out of our new gates at DFW our most profitable hub to be worth about 2% of that growth, as well as our fleet harmonization project that is adding seats to our existing narrow body aircraft, that\u2019s about 0.5% and allows us to grow capacity in an extremely efficient way. Given the timing of these two initiatives, we expect that our capacity growth will be weighted more towards the back half of 2019.","For the full year, we expect our cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items and new labor deals will grow at the top end of the 1% to 2% range that we gave previously. This is higher than previous guidance due to an increase in sale leaseback transactions on our aircraft and higher-than-expected growth in profit sharing on larger expected earnings improvement.","Overall, CASM growth in 2019 is primarily driven by increased maintenance expense from required engine overhauls, increased airport rent expense at our hubs and higher earnings related salaries and expenses primarily from the increased profit sharing. Due to the ASM growth weighted in the back half of the year, our annual CASM increase will not be spread evenly throughout the year and will be front end loaded. For the first quarter, our CASM expected to be up approximately 4% year-over-year. This rate of growth is the highest of the year due to the lower ASM growth, as well as the timing of aircraft maintenance, salaries and benefits and selling expenses throughout the year. CASM growth is expected to decelerate to approximately 2.5% in the second quarter and further decline to approximately 1% in the third and 0.5% in the fourth for 2019.","Fuel prices fell sharply at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 and we anticipate lower fuel expenses during 2019 based on the forward curve as of January 22nd. We are forecasting a decrease in consolidated fuel expense of 8.4% or approximately $830 million for the full year 2019 as compared to '18. We expect our average fuel price will be between $1.97 and $2.02 per gallon in the first quarter and be around $1.99 to $2.04 for the full year. We also guided to our first quarter 2019 TRASM increase of flat to up 2% and Robert will provide more details on our revenue guidance in his remarks. With this revenue and cost guidance, we expect our first quarter 2019 pretax margin excluding net special items to be between 2.5% and 4.5%.","Finally, we anticipate that our earnings per diluted share excluding net special items will be between $5.50 and $7.50 in 2019 and as Doug said, an increase of approximately 40% at the midpoint over our 2018 adjusted earnings per share. This forecast includes our expectations of an incremental $1 billion in revenue improvement and $300 million in cost reductions from the one airline initiative I talked about earlier. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 of $4.7 billion. This will include $3 billion in aircraft CapEx as we take delivery of 31 new large regional jets to replace 50 seaters along with 37 narrow body aircraft to replace our MD-80 fleet that will retire after the summer and also an additional 287 aircraft. In line with previous guidance, we continue to expect that our non-aircraft CapEx will be $1.7 billion in 2019. Total CapEx is presently expected to fall to $3.3 billion in 2020 and $2.2 billion in 2021 as our fleet renewal program winds down.","So looking forward, 2019 will be exciting year for American Airlines. We\u2019re executing more than $1.3 billion of annual revenue improvement and cost revenue initiatives and when combined that with the additional of high margin growth at our most profitable hubs and planned operational improvements, we expect significant earnings growth in 2019.","And with that, I will turn it over to Robert.","Robert Isomand","Thanks, Derek and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I too would like to thank our team. 2018 was a challenging year for our company as we face rising fuel prices, difficult weather conditions, the uncertainty of trade wars and the early stages of government shutdown. Despite these challenges, our team did a fantastic job of taking care of customers and each other. These are actions most certainly made the difference and demonstrated our resiliency. We\u2019re a team that collaborates, adapts and continues to move forward. So from all of us, thank you again for a job well done.","Operationally since the merger, we've been making steady progress in improving our core operating metrics but we fell short in 2018 of our targets. On our last earnings call, we highlighted some of the initiatives we are undertaking, including making the fleet ready to go each morning, making sure that we resource our team to turn aircraft throughout the day. We also continued to evaluate and fine-tune our planning processes to ensure that we are ready to deliver better service during peak schedule periods. These efforts are starting to pay off. During the December holiday period, our system-level on-time departure performance improved by 4.5 points year-over-year and our completion factor improved by 1.3 points.","At the hub level, we saw double-digit improvements in on-time departures at Reagan National, New York JFK and LaGuardia and Philadelphia. We also saw 25% improvement in mainline aircraft out of service during that same period. We\u2019re encouraged with the progress we've made thus far and look forward to keeping that going in 2019. We also completed another major integration project in the fourth quarter, the integration of our 27,000 flight attendants. This is an important milestone and our largest and most complicated integration project to-date. It involves program and new work rules and managing complicated pay processes in line with those work rules.","Importantly, training schedules and a multitude of other pieces have to work perfectly for this very important team. We\u2019re starting to see the benefits of our flight attendance now that they can fly on any aircraft at our fleet and they also have the flexibility to transfer to different bases. For our customers, we'll be able to recover much more quickly during regular operations as we can inter-mix crews. And for about the company and product attendants, we'll get a lot more efficient with scheduling our aircraft and team members.","Switching gears from integration work to product. Throughout 2018, we made great progress improving the overall experience for our customers. We\u2019ve invested $25 billion in our team in our facilities and our product and fleet since we merged five years ago. That $25 billion represents the largest investment of any carrier in the history of commercial aviation in such a short time period. These investments are transforming our product and creating a consistent and reliable airline for this coming year and long into the future.","On the product side, we've now activated free live TV on 270 aircraft and we continue to be the only U.S. carrier to offer live television on international flights. We believe our customers want faster and more consistent connectivity for work and to stream entertainment to their mobile devices. Our installations of high-speed Wi-Fi and in-seat power throughout our long-term domestic fleet are on track with 570 mainline narrow body aircraft already complete. All planned narrow bodies will be done by the middle of this year. And if you haven\u2019t experienced the ease and speed of this connectivity, you're in for a terrific experience.","In addition, we launched new fresh food items from Zoe's kitchen in our main cabin, and the uptake has been extremely positive. We're also growing our network of flagship first dining and flagship lounges with DFW opening in the second quarter. Our most club network updates are also underway with facility refresh projects in Boston, Charlotte, B Concourse and Pittsburg in the first half of 2019.","For network, we had a new international service in 2018 to Reykjavik, Budapest and Prague, which were all very well received by our travel agent and cruise partners. This year we'll continue to play to our network strengths with high margin growth plan for Dallas-Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs. At DFW, we're adding 15 new gates and roughly 100 departures per day. These additional departures will begin in April. And importantly, this capacity will be added into a robust and in first local economy here in Texas, which is one of the fastest growing U.S. markets, both in terms of GDP and wages. We'll also add new transatlantic service to the Tuscany region of Italy, Berlin, Germany and Dubrovnik, Croatia, out of our hub in Philadelphia.","And lastly in Washington DC, construction continues on the new regional terminal in DCA. We're expecting completion of that regional terminal in 2021, sounds like a far update it will come quickly and will be ready. Our plans include up-gauging aircraft to further grow this important market. Our global sales and distribution team is executing well in their initiatives, producing overall corporate revenue growth that is outpaced to system revenue growth. We will continue to build and diversify our portfolio of small business accounts that have historic pace, and we're seeing a record number of these small business accounts graduate into entry-level corporate contracts at a rate that is nearly 10 times that of last year.","In growing our small business programs, we are not only delivering strong results today but we are also establishing a foundation for growth in the long-term. In addition, we have launched both TripLink and additional international forms of payment to grow direct bookings. For our loyalty program, 2018 marked another year of revenue growth, which grew by high-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see strong year-over-year growth in advantage program enrollments and cobranded credit card acquisitions.","Our 2018 improvements in the Citi Advantage platinum select MasterCard and the launch of the no fee AAdvantage MileUp card provide added value to customers and we're really seeing the revenue benefits of this expanded portfolio. Our Citi platinum and Aviator Red MasterCards remain our most popular cards and the new AAdvantage MileUp card is exceeding our expectations. And our Citi AAdvantage executive card acquisition saw growth as well, reflecting strength across range of card segments. With a record number of co-branded AAdvantage MasterCard acquisitions in 2018, we believe our dual issuer model is delivering attractive choices for our customers. We expect these strong results to continue for our program in 2019.","Product segmentation has added another dimension to our business, and our strategy continues to perform very well. In 2018, we added premium economy to more than 100 aircraft out of a total of 124 planned aircraft. American has more aircrafts with premium economies than any other U.S. airline. The average fare for premium economy continues to be twice the coach fare. And when we look at the booking profile for this product, it is clear that customers are buying up from the main cabin. Installations remain on track and we expect them to be complete by this summer. Looking forward, we will further monetize premium economy with new revenue management and merchandising capabilities.","Basic economy has also been expanded and we now offer this option across the entire domestic network, as well as most the Atlantic, Caribbean, Mexico and Central America. We have made a number of refinements to the program to ensure that we are competitively considered, including eliminating the carry-on bag restriction. With this change, we are now able to roll out our full range of fares to more than twice as many customers as before. Since this change, the average up-sell rate continues to be around 60%, which has exceeded our initial expectations. In addition, the sell-up amount is increased by $5 and is now approximately $26.","All of this is resulted in record fourth quarter revenue of $10.9 billion, up 3% year-over-year. As Derek mentioned, we saw solid growth in other revenues, driven in part by continued strength in co-brand credit card acquisitions and cardholder spend. At our unit revenue basis, total revenue per available seat mile improved 1.7% year-over-year. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth for American. When looking across the regions, the Atlantic was the best performing entity for the third consecutive quarter as we are able to grow load factors with only a minor impact on yield. Basic economy is doing well as is premium economy, and we see no impact from Brexit at this point.","Moving to land, although slightly negative, we did see quarter to quarter improvements in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, which is encouraging. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on the quarter of 1.6 points. In the Pacific, the weaker markets got better while the better markets, Japan and Korea, got a little bit worse. We are negatively impacted by the timing of joint business settlements by approximately 2 point and foreign exchange by half of point. Despite very difficult comps, we saw improvements during the quarter in domestic yields, in part due to selling basic economy higher up the fare ladder and expanding into more markets.","Looking forward, we are head on load factor each month as we see strong build further from departure. We are excited about our planned growth in DFW, which marks our first opportunity for sizable growth at one of our most profitable hubs since the merger. We faced headwinds in the March quarter of 0.5 point due to Easter shift, 0.7 points due to foreign exchange and 0.7 points from our advantage program, which is due to the big investments we have made over the past year in the program, making it much more valuable to our customers.","We significantly increased the inventory available for redemptions in 2018, giving our customers more flexibility to use their miles. The net result of this change is that we'll be deferring more revenue from 2019 for recognition in later years. For the year, we expect the non-cash impact of 0.7. Even with these headwinds, we expect our first quarter year-over-year system TRASM to be up between zero and 2%. As we look forward into 2019, we are excited about what the future holds for American Airlines. Now that most of the distractions of integration are behind us, we are intently focused on running the best operations in America's history, improving our product and capitalizing on our network.","We have more than $1 billion in revenue initiatives that we are confident that we will deliver, and we feel really good about how these are shaping up. We will continue to expand premium economy and fine tune how we offer basic economy across our network. We also expect to continue our fleet harmonization project and further optimize how we sell that product. And we expect to become more efficient with more than $300 million in cost initiatives in our plan. All of these initiatives are on track and expected to be earnings accretive this year. We\u2019re excited about the future and look forward to sharing these results as the year progresses.","And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session. But first, we are going to give it to Doug.","Doug Parker","Just before that operator, I just want to let everybody know that in addition to me and Derek and Robert and Dan here, we have a number of handful members of the best leadership team in the world and which include we have Ben Mimmack, Kenji Hashimoto, Elise Eberwein, Maya Leibman, Steve Johnson, Don Casey, Devon May, all here.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from analysts first and then we will take questions from the media [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael Linenberg","Two questions here. Robert, just you were talking about basic economy and slowing it up, further up the fare ladder. And I'm just curious what that means? I think in the past, it was in a lower maybe four or five fare buckets. And the $5 improvement in the sell up deference to $26, typically you\u2019re dealing with a very price sensitive customer base at that part of the passenger segment base. Are you finding that that elasticity of demand maybe is less elastic and there's willingness to move up, because it's a much better product, you saw some of those?","Don Casey","It's Donald Casey. High up the fair ladder just means we get where -- I guess we're just going to up the fare ladder higher. So it does vary from market but we're up about two -- on average about two inventories from we were about four months ago. As for elasticity at $5 fare increase that's we have in market right now. With that $5 fare increase, we've actually seen the sell up remain quite constant. So we don't think we've hit a point where the sell up amount is deterring people from buying up.","Michael Linenberg","And then just second question on cost when you talk about your cost outlook for 2019, you call out that it doesn\u2019t include any labor agreements. What is it, are we down -- what is it one other labor group that has to get done. Is that -- I just want an update on that?","Don Casey","Our IAM TWU negotiations, which represent a number of workers, largest of those are mechanics and fleet service works. Those are with the NMB right now and mediatory conversations, that's the only joint collected bargaining still to be done, Mike. It's been long enough into the merger that we're getting close to amendable dates on our products, employees, and as both of those become amendable toward one of them, one of them in December of this year and the other in January of 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi ","Robert, you mentioned the growth strategy focus in DFW and that's your highest margin hub. I'm wondering if you guys could maybe quantify that a little bit more, you've quantified it before by lumping it in with DCA and Charlotte. But can you get more granular and just tell us what the operating margin at DFW was or pretax margin was in 2018? I think that would help investors better appreciate why your growth is doing what it's doing?","Derek Kerr","Just first off in terms of a little bit more granularity of our planned growth for this next year the roughly 3% growth year-over-year, DFW represents about two thirds of that. And so we're really pleased with that. And when you take a look at hub profitability, DFW, Charlotte, DCA, those are all our most profitable hubs. And so we see ourselves growing into incredible strength, and really look forward to be able take this opportunity. And I mentioned that this is really our first chance to grow one of our most profitable hubs. It's still keyed on having these additional gates. So we're really happy to get to this point and it's going to be mean big things for the company.","Doug Parker","So anyway we don\u2019t make a habit of disclosing profitability by hub, it's one we haven\u2019t done that historically but also it varies a lot by time of year. But nonetheless what Robert said is where we are is certainly one of our more profitable hubs, certainly in terms of size and also the margins are well above the system average. We did at one point but its slide the other, which I know most of our investors have seen. I talked about the margins of those three hubs versus the rest of the system and anyway, that's we're trying keep doing that.","Derek Kerr","DFW is twice the system average.","Doug Parker","So anyways, it is definitely above system average. And again we're going to this -- we like other airlines when you add flights into those types of hubs they tend to come on at above system average margins as opposed to at marginal profitability.","Joseph DeNardi ","And then Derek, I don\u2019t want to beat you up too much on this. But I do feel like on the last call, there was some commentary that CapEx in 2020 wouldn\u2019t exceed 3 and wouldn\u2019t exceed 2 and now it seems like it is going to be higher. Can you just talk about what's driving some of that and whether this current CapEx outlook is firm at this point and investors can assume what you guys have guided to is actually going to materialize? Thank you.","Derek Kerr","No, it\u2019s a fair question. We did right after the call at our last call, we had an option on 15 large RJs that we had not completed at that point in time and we didn't talk about it. So the real increase in 2020 is the 15 large RJs that will pretty close to max out our large RJ scope, so we don't expect any more. They will replace 50 seaters that are out there. So it's not for growth, because we have a number of regional aircraft that we can have. So that is the only one item that is out there that we had left for us. So I think we are pretty firm on 2020, 2021 where we're at from a CapEx number, but that wasn\u2019t an increase from where we said before, and it was 15 regional jets coming in 2020 timeframe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie Baker","First one for Robert or Don, the comment about outperforming your network competitors on RASM this year, I don\u2019t want to get into a modeling exercise here. But since the first quarter guide is in fact no different than Delta or United. Can you give us some color on what period you do expect to start overtaking the competition? I understand the $1 billion figure I guess. I guess I just don't understand what buckets phase in and when? For example, how much is the credit card step up contributing to that, any additional color?","Doug Parker","We're very confident about the ready initiatives that we have and how that revenue flows in during the course of the year. We're also going to benefit in 2019 from either comps year-over-year, which were a drag on our performance this year. And so I think that goes back to -- and our investment in Dallas, I think it's going to be one of the big drivers of improvement for us and that doesn\u2019t start until we get into the summer.","Jamie Baker","And then for Derek or possibly Doug, can you give us a little bit more color as to how the full year capacity plan emerged. Specifically were you meaningfully above or below the 3% number at any point? What influenced the 3% outcome? Or put differently, did the marketing department or fleet planning potentially wield more influence on that? Just any genesis as to how the 3% came about would be useful.","Doug Parker","I can step in on that. We grow, we take advantage of opportunities that we think are beneficial for the airline overall. As I said before, we're going to take advantage of opportunities, both in DFW and in Charlotte and DFW, two thirds of the overall growth. As you break down the rest of the growth, it's departures and into devices we think make a lot of sense. We have got some gauge that fits into that as well. And the reallocation of international flying as we talked about the restructuring of our international network is what results in the level that we're projecting for this coming year. So we're really confident that this is the right plan for American taking advantage of the assets that we have and well within our ability to execute on.","Jamie Baker","Well, just humor me then. If we were to roll back fuel prices and roll back your thought process to that of let's call the first week of October and where jet fuel has been. Would 3% still what you were thinking for 2019 at that point?","Derek Kerr","This is Derek the level of ops was put together in September, October timeframe has not changed since the fuel prices changed. So that did not impact where we are from a capacity perspective.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Doug, a question for you just on the '19 earnings guide. How do we get comfortable that you're not capturing the best of all worlds' in the guide? I mean, you've got lower fuel but then you've relatively steady RASM going forward, CASM continuing to get better. So I guess overall I mean, I think history shown us sell lower fuel leads to much weaker revenues as timing evolves, but you\u2019re showing that. So just trying to get comfortable with what you\u2019re putting out there I guess.","Doug Parker","First of all, its forecasting airline earnings a year out we all know and we certainly learned. It has a lot of variability on it. So we put some variability and what we did is provided what we believe is for our investors our best guess at this point about where we\u2019re going to come in. And we feel quite comfortable with it we wouldn\u2019t have done it otherwise, as it relates to the point about fuel prices falling when fuel prices so do revenues. I would just note again what Derek just said. We haven\u2019t changed any of our capacity plans, because fuel prices are lower. I think it's important to replay what drives airline changes in capacity driven by fuel prices, and this doesn\u2019t feel anything like what maybe you've experienced in recent terms at least to us.","We all know that back in 2015 actually oil prices have been over $100 for five years they fell down to $45, $50. And when they stayed there for a while when you see that kind of a change in the fuel price, you\u2019re going to see capacity coming in as you should. The cost of production drop that much, profitability goes up and production goes up. So that doesn\u2019t seem irrational, never seen irrational at the time. What\u2019s happened here is having stayed that level for whatever it was two and half to three years in the $45 to $50 range, oil prices ramped pretty quickly. Through 2017 and '18, we got at levels around $80 a barrel per Brent and above. And the industry was somewhat getting itself well at those levels, but not all the way and now it's corrected some of it but not nearly all of it. So I\u2019m not suggesting that this is going to correct all the way. What I\u2019m pointing out is simply this fall from -- I know these are rounded number here but from $80 barrel Brent to $60 barrel Brent, I don't think it makes -- I know for American Airlines it doesn't a wit of difference on how much where we are going to fly. I don\u2019t think it makes a wit of difference for the industry, frankly, because we hadn\u2019t got our self adjusted to run up to 80 and it falls back to 60 I think. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to make huge adjustments in revenue, but that\u2019s our view.","Rajeev Lalwani","And then a quick follow-up on that capacity side, and I think Jamie was asking about this earlier. So previously you had talked about sub GDP capacity growth, I think most of us were assuming 1% to 2% and now you\u2019re coming in at 3%, which is guess is GDP plus, maybe my general assumptions are incorrect. But can you just walk me through what changed if something did in fact changed?","Doug Parker","I think Derek just said it doesn\u2019t change, and there are GDP estimates out there that certainly 3% and higher. So to the extent we produce the number other than what we announced today and this is right in line with what we've been thinking all along. And again, I would note, given where we're growing, we feel really comfortable with this level of growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay ","I do want to continue on this line a little bit that Jamie brought up as well. And Dough, before -- you guys just said you're going to grow less than competitors, and now you are saying you're going to grow RASM more than competitors. And I appreciate that shift and that is a change. I'm hoping fuel prices aside for a second. Is there any change to how you guys are thinking about capacity in the context of market share and maybe are you kind of line of sight on better ops, you feel better about maybe, I don\u2019t know, let's say, sticking-up for yourself. But maybe being a little bit more tactically aggressive in keeping some share or it does make sense to do it, because again that change the drop of growing less than and now growing RASM than more than, is it changed. I'm wondering kind of what drove that language difference.","Doug Parker","You said RASM, you mean ASMs?","Hunter Keay","Yes, you said you are going to grow ASMs less now you're saying you're going to grow RASM more. So it's a change. And I'm just kind of curious just to know what drove that language difference\u2026","Doug Parker","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a change, but anyway I'll try again. So we have I believe consistently we've said that we believe where American Airlines is we have a largely mature network. And you should expect to see us grow at certainly domestically kind of in line with GDP growth. And that's what we've been doing. And this 3% number is not, I don\u2019t think dramatically different than that to the extent you assume there was something different in that. And any, we didn\u2019t mean to suggest anything other than that. We have not changed that number from the time we started producing level of ops as Derek said, six or nine months ago.","So that hasn\u2019t been a change and indeed I think is entirely consistent with what we've said, which is we expect to grow somewhat in line with U.S. GDP growth. And also we did say, we think that's lower than we're seeing at competitor and that\u2019s certainly the case, and maybe a competitor that maybe a little bit lower than that, that\u2019s how we know if that's the case. But if we're not the lowest we're the second lowest at this number. So all of that seems entirely consistent to me with what we said in the past. We haven't made any changes to our capacity growth based upon anything other than where we see growth capabilities. And I can't stress enough the fact that when you get 10 gates at a hub -- 15 gates at Dallas-Fort Worth that's a huge growth opportunity. But despite that, we're growing in line with or maybe modestly higher depending on what your GDP estimates are in line with GDP.","Derek Kerr","And I'll just add that our growth it's being funded by improved density from up-gauges and improved aircraft utilization.","Doug Parker","And then the piece I was looking, Hunter, in RASM is growing faster. I don\u2019t think -- the fact that -- at those levels of capacity growth, we do believe that our unit revenues will still grow faster than the industries, because of the initiatives we have in place. But those are -- I don\u2019t think that's inconsistent, Hunter.","Hunter Keay","No, it's not. Again, I didn\u2019t mean for the question to be negative. Again, and this is just my -- I guess I'll just ask a true follow-up. Again, I'm just wondering if there's been a change in philosophy about how you're thinking about growth in the context of what's happening in the industry. I'm not saying your plan change, fuel or whatever. Are you just going to say like we're going to sort of start punching a little bit harder here and fight for what's ours and fight for share that we think we deserve? And philosophically, how you are thinking about that in the context of what's going in the broader competitive industry. And it's not that anything has changed with the plan, just philosophically, how you are thinking about capacity growth going forward.","Doug Parker","Hunter, look we go back to look where a global hub and spoke airline, our greatest assets are our hubs and you will see us take advantage of opportunities in our hubs. And we are going to be incredibly competitive everywhere. The one thing I will say as well is I think we are being smart with how we deploy capacity as well and taking advantage of the dynamics of our hubs as well. So some of the things that you may see going forward is that from a seasonal perspective, some of the hubs Phoenix, Chicago performed better at certain points of the year than otherwise. And so you will see us flex to take maximum advantage of those opportunities.","And the good news is that as we push for fleet commonality, as we have rationalized our regional partners and reduced sub fleets, as we have gotten through integration and now can make full use of our team, you are going to see us be very smart about making sure we take advantage of opportunities throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.","Duane Pfennigwerth","So just this EPS guidance is a relatively new experience for airlines and I am wondering if you could reflect on 2019, the execution versus that guidance, what are the lessons learned and how did that impact your guidance and your plans for 2019?","Doug Parker","I don\u2019t think it's a secret, we reluctantly --. We were reluctant participants in this exercise, feeling really strongly that we think the best thing for us to do for our shareholders is not to try and project what the earnings are going to be but rather go run our business best we can and tell you what our plans are and let you do that. But also understand that it's important to a number of our shareholders that we at least give them more guidance in that. And as other airlines started giving full year EPS guidance, we chose to do as well. So we like you are somewhat -- as you say are somewhat new to this. Our experience last year was we ended up having to, which we adjusted downward a couple of times, which of course you don\u2019t like to do that was each time there was a reason. Given that again it seems logical, at the time had we known it, we wouldn\u2019t have the numbers as high as they were.","So anyway, that\u2019s -- I don't know how other to explain it other than to say we are our best given the experience, I'll tell you this. We've certainly worked to make sure that we have a wide enough range that we feel comfortable, because we don\u2019t want to actually adjust it again and hope that we don\u2019t need to so we come up with a pretty wide range, but also done our best to give you a number that we feel really confident. And certainly last years' experience weighed on where we decided to set that guidance, because we don't want to have that experience again, no guarantee we won't but we don\u2019t want to.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then just for my follow-up, one of your peers has started to break out percent of revenue generated from premium products, and basically revenue away from the main cabin and the implied higher growth embedded in those initiatives. Have you studied that disclosure at all and would it make sense for American also? Thanks for taking the questions.","Doug Parker","We have looked at it. We in the fourth quarter I think had a slightly different metric just looking at premium cabin performance. Premium cabin performance actually drove about a third of our overall unit revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","Derek Kerr","And Duran, this is Derek. We looked at it as we go into 2019. And maybe something that we break out further, it's not easy to put things in all these buckets. But we will look at it more in 2019 to determine whether we want to break out the P&L little bit further. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open. ","Helane Becker","So two questions. One, can you say what the biggest bucket is in terms of the billion dollars in incremental revenue this year. And my second question if you pulled your customers, what would there number one compliant be about the airline and how are you addressing that?","Doug Parker","So the biggest bucket is really what we're doing in terms of segmentation, so basic and premium economy are the two largest drivers. Then as we take a look in that billion dollars, we've talked about big opportunities within segmentation. We've talked about big opportunities within merchandising. Those we hope are willing to start kicking in later in the year. And the final bucket that we see a lot of opportunities is network, and we've talk about DFW and getting to 900 departures but as well that involves restructuring the network and making sure that we're putting aircraft where they want to go.","In terms of the customer feedback, we know what the biggest point of concerning issue with our customers and that is they want a reliable airline, they want to be certain that they are getting what they paid for. And so from that perspective as we take a look at our goals for the coming year that is top of mind everywhere. And for us its upside, we didn\u2019t perform as well as we wanted to in 2018. We expect to reverse that very quickly. And we're pleased with the kind of things were seeing, especially over the holiday season and as we get into January.","Helane Becker","So can you say, Robert, if your net promoter score again proved, let\u2019s say if you did it in January of '19 versus maybe July of '18?","Doug Parker","No. So we have a lot of internal metrics and we have likelihood to recommend scores. And we weren\u2019t pleased with our likelihood to recommend scores. As a matter of fact, our own internal measures show they fell year-over-year for the first time in a number of years. And when you trace that back, it's certainly not due to the product that we've -- the investments that we've made in the product. People are very pleased with what they're getting in terms of service and in terms of the amenities and fleet and airports. But if you\u2019re not as reliable as you should be, as you want to be that has a negative impact overall. And so the good news on that and what we have seen is that when you do get back to the reliability that we aspire to things turn really quickly and we'll be able to take advantage of all those investments that we've made.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question Catherine O' Brian with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Catherine O' Brian","Maybe just one more on your comments about outperforming your peers on RASM this year. Could you talk about maybe like the one or two biggest drivers of that, help us size and help us to think about how they ran through the year. Is a lot of Dallas? Are we thinking more about premium economy? Just any color there would be really helpful.","Don Casey","The two big things that are going to drive through really is DFW and the investment we're going to make in DFW in terms of the incremental flying and the relative revenue performance in DFW versus the rest of the system. The second one is just the merchandising capabilities, which we're going to be bringing online during the course of the year, which is one of our big revenue initiatives for 2019. And the reality is we're going to be helped a little bit this year on comps, they were a headwind in 2018 they'll be a bit of a tailwind in 2019.","Catherine O' Brian","So it sounds like maybe we will start to see that outperformance pick-up starting second quarter on?","Don Casey","That's correct.","Catherine O' Brian","And then maybe just one more. So some of your peers know they were incorporating weakness across the Atlantic into their March quarter guide. Are you seeing the same thing and are you incorporating that guidance? And then how should we think about the ringing of your RASM by geography, going forward?","Don Casey","So we look at the Atlantic, we expect -- Atlantic has been very strong. We had a -- it was our best-performing entity in the fourth quarter. We expect really a modest deceleration in our Atlantic performance in the first quarter, driven in large part due to additional of headwinds related to currency.","Domestic, we've had very strong yield growth in large part to the expansion of the basic economy to more markets, as well as other price increases. We've seen strong corporate demand. Our negotiated corporate revenue domestically is up 10%, led by our professional services. And we're expecting kind of similar performance in 1Q '19, and that includes the impact we've seen to-date of the government shutdown and the impact of the Easter shift.","In LATAM, we ended the quarter with modestly negative unit revenue growth, driven by our long haul operations. Although, we did see in the quarter that Brazil and Argentina did improve on a quarter-to-quarter basis and we're pleased with this given the currency and capacity environments in those markets. Mexico also improved quarter-to-quarter and positive unit revenue in the fourth quarter. And we saw demand recover, but the pricing environment in Mexico overall is still a bit soft. Caribbean was positive and had positive unit revenue growth, and we've experienced very, very strong unit revenue growth for last seven quarters, so a little well positive, not quite as positive on a quarter-to-quarter basis that\u2019s still expected to be positive going forward.","And LATAM overall, in the fourth quarter, we had 1.6 points of headwind with currency. As we look forward to LATAM, we expect similar trends going forward with currency being an additional 0.5 point of headwind as we head into 2019. Encouraging for us is capacity in Brazil. We'll benefit from our own capacity reductions in Brazil in the first quarter. And as we head into the second quarter, the industry has taken out a material amount of seats. Pacific unit revenues slightly negative with Hong Kong, Japan and Korea all positive, although, not quite as strong quarter-to-quarter compared to third quarter of '18; China and South Pacific, although negative we are improving; and we expect Pacific to be the strongest performing quarter-to-quarter entity in the first quarter of '19.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with Citi Group. Your line is open.","Kevin Crissey","If we could step back and talk about costs over time and the big picture. I've been a bit disappointed not seeing a better cost trajectory post merger. I know there were certainly some labor contracts catch up and that adds inflation. But I would've thought that they'd be pulled out post merger considering. I think a couple of percent CASM mix increase on a 3% capacity growth is kind of normal inflation for an airline, maybe its slightly lower, but not as low as I would expect post a merger. Can you talk about why there hasn\u2019t been more opportunity on the cost side there?","Doug Parker","This is Doug and Derek can chime in. Again, I encourage you all get the details. We go through the details with Derek. Some of this is just depreciation expense and things like that that are driving these costs and timing of maintenance and other issues. But to your larger point, first off the labor issues is you already noted it, but can't ignore it. I mean we came out of a merger with the world's largest airline and a phenomenal group of team members who are working for the less than their peers at other airlines and that\u2019s -- we can't run an airline that way, nor should we ask our people to. So we've certainly had some increases in labor costs. We have largely closed those gaps versus our competitor airlines but that drove very large expense increases at American Airlines. And again, the expense increase is that we actually feel good about, because we needed to do that in order to produce -- to build the airline we want to build.","Otherwise our costs again it's harder to address the qualitative response like that without a detailed response. But in general, what we know is we have gone through an effort led by Derek to go pull out expenses and it's been really successful. We had a relatively painful reduction in the management team around here and in the prior and the last year. And we will continue to do those things. What we know is if we weren\u2019t doing those things, well that number may not seem exciting to you, it would be about $300 million higher than it would have been otherwise without this work. So we continue to work at it and we will continue to work at it, but we feel really good about the cost discipline that we have instilled in American Airlines. Once we got to the point that we have our team being compensated in line with our peers.","Kevin Crissey","And maybe for Robert, you talked about the growth in the most profitable hubs. Can you talk about the actions you're taking in your less profitable hubs?","Robert Isom","So that goes back to one of the comments made a little bit earlier. We are trying to be really smart about how we deploy capacity. So when we take a look at a hub perspective, we can now that we have got a lot of the integration behind us and certainly a lot more fleet commonality, we can take a look at Chicago during the summer, and it being really healthy for us at that point in time. And then at other points of the season, take a look at Phoenix and Miami, which can perform better. We've mentioned things about what we're doing with our international network. So from a China perspective, we've made some adjustments in our network there and have been redeploying assets to where they're most profitable.","We have been taking a look at making sure that we're maximizing our opportunities with our joint business partners as well. So from a whole perspective, we're incredibly competitive in each of our hubs but we\u2019re making sure that we use them for what they do best for American. And you see that with the growth that\u2019s coming in DFW, you will see it with the growth that\u2019s coming next year in Charlotte and you'll see it when we get the regional terminal done in DCA the following year and our ability to up-gauge there. The plans that we have in place I think for this coming year in Phoenix, Philly, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, they are well at tuned to what we can do best at this year.","Operator","We have time for one more question from our analyst before moving on to media. And our last analyst question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Brandon Oglenski","I guess, Doug or Robert, I think the market wants to believe here, I mean your stocks trading at 5 PE. If you can start to show some relative margin traction, I think people will be pretty impressed. But if we look at 2018, I mean, you guys lagged your network competitors that you want to benchmark against capacity and RASM here pretty significantly. And if I go back to 2017 analyst meeting, we had pretty big revenue initiatives plotted for 2018 I think which were above a $1 billion too. So I guess what sense of urgency does the organization have this year to really deliver on that billion dollar revenue target? Or is this just something where circumstances are going to dictate that maybe like to push out again?","Robert Isom","Those initiatives we delivered primarily almost all in. Basically the economy actually didn\u2019t as it sorted out competitively didn't deliver the level of value that we had expected that would be. But the urgency has been high, remains high and we remain excited. The fact that our revenues didn't perform as well as some of our peers in 2018 is a combination of largely the fact where we fly. I'd point out again that when the performance in Latin America, particularly South America where we are much larger than our competitors versus they had a big impact on that number. And then in relation to one of them, of course they did a really nice job of getting an airline that wasn\u2019t performing particularly well performing well.","But if you look on two years over two years against that airline, we're still -- our RASM is still up more than any of it. So the issue becomes more of an issue of some concerning to us is when you look to the fact that RASM versus Delta that was -- that have been closing every year since the merger widened in 2018, again, a lot of that\u2019s Latin America. But also as we look at it, the initiatives that Robert and Don described are some areas that they've done -- they're a little bit of ahead us. They merged well ahead of us. They've done a nice job. But things like the ability to get sell up into more channels and to more customers is something that we will be doing before too long has allowed them to widen that gap.","So we're running full force, have been running full force. We'll continue to do an amazing job. But because of all those things, as we head into 2018, we remain confident in saying that we believe that in 2018, our unit revenue will outpace our competitors. But again, that's a forecast and it's dependent also upon what they do. But we said that last three quarters now, because we feel really good about where we are positioned not less -- more of a comment on where we are versus where they are and to the extent that they are doing things we don\u2019t know that may or may not be the case. But I did want to let our investors know that what we saw in '18 as our RASM declining versus our competitors for the first time in a few years wasn\u2019t something that we expect to continue.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our analyst question-and-answer-session. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Marry Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Your line is open.","Mary Schlangenstein ","Can you guys talk about any financial impact from the government shutdown, Southwest and Delta have both put a number on that at least for the month of January. Can you talk about what you are seeing?","Don Casey","We have seen some impact, but there is a lot of uncertainty as to what's going happen going forward. So we have not yet put a dollar value on it. But what we've seen today it is included in our guidance for the first quarter.","Mary Schlangenstein","And can you talk about what you are seeing. Is it just basically a decline in government -- business travel and government contactors travelling?","Don Casey","It's a bit of softness in 0 to 14 day travel.","Mary Schlangenstein ","And Don can you also talk a little bit about what your yields on closing business travel are looking like this first quarter? Are they higher than a year ago, or are they staying strong?","Don Casey","We saw in the fourth quarter quite strong yields and actually the last two quarters in our 0 to 6 and 7 to 13 day booking windows, and we would expect that to continue going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Tangel with The Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.","Andrew Tangel ","A question on the shutdown as well this week unions for aircraft controllers, pilots and flight attendants are someday longer over the shutdowns effects on the U.S. aviation system and raised questions about safety and that would be entire system because at some point break. How concerned are you about that right now? And are you all seeing signs of stress or worry or any operational issues at this point?","Robert Isom","First-off, our team in conjunction with our partners both at the FAA and from a security perspective TSA were always going to make the right decision for the safety and security of our team members and our customers. So there is no doubt, no lack of confidence in what we have in front of us. That said, we don't need distractions, we need people to be at work and confident and taking care of, and we do that at American with our team and we need to get our partners in a situation where they feel similarly confident in being taken care of.","Doug Parker","To Roberts point, our business is so focused on safety that to the extent there are fewer TSA people are fewer air traffic controllers. What tends to happen is you get long lines at TSA, but still the same level of scrutiny. You get larger separation of aircraft, so you have delayed air space. It was really concerning to us. So that's what we feared may happen. We want to thank all the people at TSA and all of our air traffic controllers who are showing us without actually getting pay checks and taking care of our team, taking care of flying public, it's phenomenal what they're doing we appreciate what they're doing. And we would encourage our government to get them to a position where these hard-working people would be paid for what they're doing.","Andrew Tangel ","And as a follow up on something Don said, I'm going to go with reference to the quarter one outlook. You cited the potential for zero growth in the first quarter unit revenue to the government shutdown. Overall, are you all -- the shutdown aside or potential including the shutdowns. Are you all seeing any signs of an economic slowdown or any early signs of recession, any difficulty raising fares in the main cabin or premium seats or anything of that nature?","Don Casey","And just to clarify I guess I'm not sure what your comment just about zero growth related to the government shutdown. We haven\u2019t really put a number on the government shutdown. And it is included in our guidance, which is 0% to 2%. So we are expecting positive unit revenue growth in the first quarter. As for looking at the rest of the business whether we are seeing any slowdown in bookings anywhere in the system, we are not. Our corporate demand continues to be strong and our held load factor position going forward is up materially on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is open.","Leslie Josephs","On the corporate demand just to clarify. You said that it's higher this year than last year at the same point for January. I'm just trying to gauge the shutdown impact, and what there was I didn\u2019t catch that. And the other question is, are you still committed to flying to Venezuela?","Don Casey","Corporate revenues so far this year have been up month to date. As far as Venezuela goes, we fly three times a day there and we intend to continue our service. It\u2019s a relatively small part of our business. It's 0.2% of our overall system revenue.","Leslie Josephs","And then the shutdown, the impact you said bit of softness in the zero to 14 to day yields?","Don Casey","That is correct.","Leslie Josephs","But no dollar impacts that you are seeing so far?","Don Casey","We are not going to disclose a dollar impact. We will look at it after the government gets back to where it can figure out how impactful it was.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Rucinski from Reuters. Your line is open.","Tracy Rucinski","I wanted to ask about China. I have seen some data out of China that shows that 20% decline in outbound traffic to the United States in the third quarter of 2018. Have you seen any decline in inbound traffic from China, particularly for shorter states?","Don Casey","We have not. Now, we did take some capacity actions in China and we ended up suspending service from Chicago, Shanghai and Beijing, which probably helps us a bit more. But our advanced load factor in China looks fine.","Tracy Rucinski","So no impact from the ongoing trade\u2026","Don Casey","We don\u2019t see any impact right now in our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Biers with AFP. Your line is open.","John Biers","Are you worried that there could be a hit related to the shutdown, either from people who are worried about safety, because of things like what the unions are saying about air traffic controllers and so forth or because they are worried about the delays to the system that the extra half-full of traveling? Just looking forward, is this something that could really hit demand in 2019?","Doug Parker","Again, we would just encourage the government to get reopened, so that people can get paid. And there are customers who can rest assured that they won't be waiting in long lines or face delays. At the airport because of air traffic controllers that can't afford to show forth, that\u2019s what needs to happen. Demand remains strong and this is certainly not a long-term demand issue. Our government presumably will reopen again one day and hopefully not before too long. So it's certainly been long enough we\u2019re putting strain on people who have been working now without -- for missing a couple of paychecks and that will at some point result in people not being at work. When we don\u2019t have enough TSA agents, you will see longer lines. We don\u2019t have enough ATC controllers you will see more delays in aerospace. Those will be bad things. So far everybody's been phenomenal about doing it. We\u2019re concerned but we haven\u2019t seen any drop off in demand other than the moderate softness Don talked about in Slide 14, because it travelled during the shutdown itself. But demand for air travel remains strong, people are flying and I suspect they will continue to want to fly as we get the government opened up again.","Don Casey","And remarkably, people are doing a fantastic job of keeping the aircraft and airports moving. And so, we're really confident in what we\u2019ve seen so far in terms of operations and thankful to all those that are doing their jobs.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Your line is open.","Robert Silk ","Can you tell me if you all have any plan and NDC initiatives plan in the coming year and what those might be if you do?","Don Casey","We do have plans. We've announced them to the marketplace. And we continue to plan to expand our NDC offering. Now, our approach to this is to improve the product offering that we\u2019re able to deliver through NDC. So that our agency partners are able to service customers more effectively and that's our focus going forward.","Robert Silk ","Will you work in -- increase for the channels that you worked through NDC, more direct connects or more -- or going through any of these exchanges I should say or any of these approaches?","Don Casey","Well, I mean, again our plan is to continue to expand the use of NDC with everyone that is interested because we think we're going to be able to deliver more product and better products to their customers.","Doug Parker","Thanks operator. Thanks everyone for your interest, and thanks in particular to the American Airlines team for taking care of each other and our customers. We're excited for 2019 and we appreciate your interest. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"1307":["American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 20, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Dan Cravens - IR","Doug Parker - Chairman and CEO","Robert Isom - President","Derek Kerr - CFO","Elise Eberwein - EVP People and Communications","Bev Goulet - Chief Integration Officer","Maya Leibman - Chief Information Officer","Don Casey - SVP Revenue Management","Analysts","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Jack Atkins - Stephens","Julie Yates - Credit Suisse","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Darryl Genovesi - UBS","Andrew Didora - Bank of America","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star Telegram","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Edward Russell - Flightglobal","Conor Shine - Dallas Morning News","Ted Reed - The Street","Operator","Good morning and welcome to the American Airlines Group Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead.","Dan Cravens","Thanks and good morning, everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our question-and-answer session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP People and Communications, Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer, Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs and Don Casey, Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.","As is our normal practice, we are going to start the call today with Doug and he will provide an overview of the third quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment and then after we hear from these comments, we will open the call for analysts questions and lastly, questions from the media.","Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call also will be archived on our website, the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Dan. Thanks everybody for being on. Pretax earnings excluding special items of $1.5 billion that's down from last year's $1.9 million, but both by declining new revenues our total CASM was down 2.2% versus last year.","And increasing unit cost driven primarily by investor synergy but while they're down our still second-best third quarter in history of American Airlines behind only the third quarter of 2015. Also because of our share repurchase activity our adjusted EPS was actually up even though earnings were down from $2.77 up to $2.80 in the quarter. So these results are due to fantastic team in American doing an amazing job for our customary. They were extremely grateful. They have done what they do.","On the revenue front Rob will provide a lot more details and we're encouraged by the trends. Our CASM was down 2.2% in the third quarter, but that's better than we've seen in terms of the decline in recent quarters, as better than our competitors were experiencing.","In fact the month of September CASM was actually improved year-over-year, which was the first month of year-over-year CASM improvement for American Airlines since November of 2014. Now course September was helped by the calendar on a year-over-year basis, which is why we at Americans would like to focus much on monthly revenue numbers, but the trends is good and it appears to be continuing as we'll discuss.","Our unit cost grew in the quarter and Derek will provide more detail on that, but the primary driver of the unit cost increase is our decision to invest in team. We had pay increases and profit-sharing that are by far the largest drivers of the cost increase and we're pleased to be able to provide those improvements to our team members.","We now reached new agreements with all of our workgroups. So the large increases are behind us. Furthermore as we complete more of our integration in 2017, we'll be able to being eliminating some of the redundancy still exist because of the two airlines and that will help us reduce expenses in 2018 and beyond.","As integration we had enormous success earlier this month with the flawless integration of our flight operating system FOS. This is an extremely complicated system integration that's lead to operational disruptions of that airlines as they've gone through mergers and our team executed without a hitch.","While we're doing all that, we continue to invest in our products and improve the product. We had 12 new aircrafts as part of our unprecedented fleet renewal program report. American fleet is now more than 40% younger of large network years and that gap is widening.","We had 10 new destinations to our network including five acumens new service from LA to Hong Kong next monthly we'll begin daily flights to Havana and then you have position as the largest carrier to Cuba. We continue to make enormous improvements to our clubs including in this quarter, the reopening of a renovated Admirals Club in Rio de Janeiro and the refurbishment of our London Heathrow Arrivals Club, which now has 29 shower rooms and business center.","So in summary, the U.S. airline industry has been transformed and American Airlines is well-positioned for success in the new world. We're producing record profits, new record profits despite a soft economic environment and we're using those profits to improve customer service through important investments in both our products and energy and we're returning the excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases.","So there is much work ahead but the American team continues to further up the challenge. We're extremely pleased with where we are and very bullish on the future of American Airlines. So now I would like to turn over to Derek, who will provide more details on the financial results and then to our recently appointed President, Robert Isom, who will discuss operating performance and revenue environment. Derek?","Derek Kerr","Thanks Doug and good morning, everyone. We filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning and in that release, our third quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $737 million or a $1.40 $1.40 per diluted share. This compares to our third quarter 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.49 per diluted share and if we exclude the special charges, we reported a net profit of $933 million in the third quarter of 2016 or $1.76 per diluted share versus the third quarter net profit of $1.9 billion in 2015 or $2.77 per diluted share.","Our GAAP third quarter pretax profit was $1.2 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 11.2%. Excluding special charges, our third quarter pretax profit was $1.5 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 14%. Excluding the effects of special charges and the non-cash tax provision of $449 million our third quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.80 per share, compared to $2.77 in the third quarter of 2015, reflecting a 22% reduction in our fully diluted average share count during the quarter.","We continue to see sequential improvement in the revenue environment during the quarter, which Robert will talk more about for the quarter. Total operating revenues were $10.6 billion down 1.1% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9.1 billion, down 2.2%, driven by a 0.6% decline in yields.","Cargoes revenues were down 5.1% to a $171 million due primarily to a decline in international and domestic yields. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion up 8.5% versus the same period last year due to the impact of the new credit card deal signed with Barclays U.S. City and MasterCard on July 12, 2016.","Total GAAP operating expenses were $9.2 billion up 5.2% versus the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in our people through contractual increases and the introduction of profit sharing plan, investments in our product, investment which includes our fleet as Doug talked about and investments in our operation.","These investments were offset in part by lower fuel costs, our average mainline fuel price including taxes for the third quarter of 2016 was down 12.4% year-over-year to $1.46 per gallon. Third quarter mainline cost per ASM was 11.96 up 5.6% year-over-year, excluding special charges and fuel our mainline CASM was 9.32 up 8.9% year-over-year.","Regional operating cost per ASM in the third quarter was 18.85, which was down 5.2% from the quarter in 2015, excluding special charges and fuel, regional CASM was 15.08, a decrease of 4.4% due to the continued shift to more efficient large regional jets.","We ended the third quarter of 2016 with approximately $9.2 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.8 billion and $2.4 billion in an undrawn revolver capacity well in the excess -- well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimal liquidity we seek to maintain for this foreseeable future. The company also had 635 million classified as restricted cash during the quarter.","We did generate $1.1 billion during the quarter of cash flow from operations and made $372 million in debt payments. We continue to believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program, which will be substantially complete in 2017.","During the quarter, the company took advantage of favorable market conditions and completed several financing transactions including a re-pricing of the company's 2014 term loan collateralized by our London Heathrow flights which reduced interest by 25 basis points and the issuance of $814 million EETC consisting of both AA and A tranches which priced at a blended rate of just over 3%.","In the third quarter of 2016, the company returned $669 million to its shareholders including quarterly dividend payments of $53 million and the repurchase of $616 million of common stock for 18.2 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned $9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share distributions and a cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 31% from $756 million and merger closed in December 2013 to 519.2 million shares on September 30, 2016. At the end of the third quarter 2016, the company had approximately 555 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization.","Turning to our guidance for the remainder of 2016, we continue to monitor our capacity plans and in our IR update issued last week, we lowered full-year 2016 system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 1.5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline capacity to be 57.5 billion ASMs and our regional capacity to be 7.84 billion ASMs. So our consolidated capacity will be flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to be up approximately 5% to 7%, while regional CASM excluding special items and fuel is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline CASM excluding fuel and special items to be up between 8% and 10%.","This year-over-year increase is driven primarily by investment in our people of about six points, maintenance timing of two points and DNA from new aircraft and to increase CapEx of one point. Regional CASM excluding special items and fuel is expected to be down by approximately 3% to 5% in the same period.","As we look forward for the first time since mid-2014, year-over-year fuel prices are expected to be higher through the remainder of the year. Based on the forward curve as of October 17, our mainline fuel price forecast for the fourth quarter of 2016 is $1.59 to $1.64 per gallon, while our regional fuel forecast for the fourth quarter is $1.65 to $1.70.","Despite these higher fuel prices, we expect the full-year 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year. Using the midpoint of the guidance we just provided along with the revenue guidance that Robert will give, we expect our fourth quarter pretax margin excluding special items to be between 4% and 6%.","For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in 2016. We've 20 deliveries worth approximate $1.1 billion, which will occur in the fourth quarter and we expect to invest $300 million in non-aircraft CapEx in the quarter, which is $1.2 billion for the full year, which includes continued integration work and investments to improve our product and operations, some that Doug referred to in his comments.","Looking out to 2017, we are taking a disciplined approach to matching our plan capacity levels with anticipated levels of demand. We're still in the process of developing our operating plan, so our formal capacity guidance will come out when we report fourth-quarter earnings, but we currently expect our year-over-year system capacity be up approximately 1% in 2017.","We expect full year 2017 domestic capacity to be flat while our international capacity is expected to be up approximately 3.5%. Our international growth is driven primarily by our Pacific entity as we annualize the new routes added in 2016.","We'll also know more about our 2017 unit cost projections after we complete our operating plan, but as Doug noted, we now have the bulk of our cost increases behind us. As we look to 2017, we expect the full-year impact of our labor agreements will add approximately two points of CASM, but otherwise our core CASM growth should be around 2% on a very modest 1% growth in ASMs.","And as Doug also noted, with the integration nearing completion, we will be able to begin the process of eliminating some redundancies in 2017, which will help our unit costs in 2018 and beyond.","So in conclusion, we couldn't be more proud of more than 100,000 team members who continue to deliver outstanding results. We continue to make great progress integrating our airlines, most recently with our flight operating system cutover and we've already seen some positive results. We are also excited about the commercial initiatives our team is working on and looking forward to reporting on their continued success on future calls.","Thanks again for your time this morning and with that I'll turn it over to Robert.","Robert Isom","Thanks Derek. Good morning to everyone. I appreciate that you're joining us. I would like to start out by thanking our 100,000 team members for their outstanding work during the quarter and I characterize this quarter as being one of operational and commercial challenges, but I would like to underscore positively that we have executed integration items exceptionally well.","Despite all these challenges, our team's commitment to taking care of our customers and each other has never wavered. Some performance was challenging for both our employees and customers. The primary driver was inclement weather that seemed to settle over a number of our hubs throughout the summer, most notably Dallas or DFW.","In addition we struggled to operate our expanded Los Angeles schedule reliably. primarily due to airport and facility constraints. We're working with [indiscernible] so that we will be better able to meet our customer's demands to fly American from Los Angeles going forward.","I'm happy to report that our reliability has rebounded to new record levels across our system in September as a result of a number of factors and those trends have continued well into October and we expect that they will continue. Again I appreciate the efforts of our front-line team to take care of our customers throughout the summer and especially and most recently during Hurricane Matthew.","We have successfully completed some major integration milestones over the past few months including a single flight operating system for our pilots dispatching aircraft and I am so appreciative of our 15,000 pilots the APA, our IT and flight teams for their efforts to ensure a seamless cutover.","We've also put new uniforms on all of our employees. We have interim agreements with our fleet service and mechanic workgroups. Tentative agreements now with our flight crew training instructors and some engineers and once these tentative agreements have been ratified all American team members will be benefiting from pay increases that resulted from our merger.","So much of what we're striving to accomplish going forward would be difficult to address without having the integration work completed and completed well. As I start to think about our plans for next year, there's good reason to believe that America will improve versus the industry and operations performance. We're taking a fresh look at how we schedule our aircraft reliability.","Our 777 200 reconfigurations will be completed by summer 2017. Our 787 fleet has reached a critical mass allowing for easier recovery from off schedule ops and with a single flight operating system, our aircraft and pilots can now be used interchangeably instead of being managed as separate entities.","We're also making big investments in service recovery and customer notification tools for passengers and employees that we'll continue to roll out next year. On the revenue front, our third quarter TRASM was down 2.2%, while the revenue environment is still challenging in certain areas of the world, we as -- we have observed improvements in many places.","The third quarter was much better than the second quarter, so we continue to see improving trends. As Doug noted, in September we had positive year-over-year TRASM and PRASM and that's the first time this is has occurred since November of 2014 and we're seeing improving trends in cargo as well.","September marked the first time since December 2014 that our monthly year-over-year cargo revenue has improved. Domestically consolidated PRASM was down 1.8%. This was our best result since the first quarter of 2015. We saw strength across the board with all hubs have a second derivative improvement. Los Angeles and DCA were top performers year-over-year.","Internationally, we have lapped the dollar strengthening last year as well as declining international surcharges. Latin was our first entity to turn positive with PRASM up 1.8% for the quarter, driven by 25% year-over-year improvement in Brazil PRASM as capacity rationalized and the Real strengthened.","In addition there was continued strength in Mexico. The Atlantic was our worst-performing international entity down 11.2%. The main drivers of performance are continued capacity increases, specifically for low-cost carriers, the devaluation of the British Pound as a result of the Brexit vote and lingering impacts from recent terrorist attacks.","Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 10.5% on capacity increases of 28.7% with continued weakness in China due to excess capacity and growing into our new services from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Haneda, Sydney and Auckland. We're pleased to see corporate passenger demand holding up, driven by our domestic entity. In the third quarter, we saw increases in both absolute revenue and revenue share and we see similar trends developing in the fourth quarter.","Looking forward, we see some choppiness in the fourth quarter due to holiday shifts with September and January benefiting from traffic shifting from October and December. We expect November to be the strongest month of the quarter versus 2015.","Regionally, the domestic fourth-quarter looks about the same as the third quarter due to holiday shifts. In Latin America we expect continued sequential improvement and low single-digit increase in PRASM. We expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with low double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines","And with that, we expect our fourth-quarter TRASM not PRASM, but the total TRASM to be down 1% to 3% year-over-year. We expect that our fourth quarter decline to be smaller than our third quarter decline, despite a more difficult fourth-quarter year-over-year comparison.","As we look forward to 2017, we expect continued second derivative improvement in year-over-year TRASM performance and look forward to getting to positive TRASM in the first half of the year.","In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at American Airlines. We made a tremendous amount of progress over this past year with respect to integration, operational improvement and getting back on path to positive TRASM. All these important steps are critical to restoring American Airlines to its rightful industry-leading position. We have a lot of work left to do and we're confident we have the right plans, the right team in place to execute and we look forward to reporting back on future successes.","And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel","Doug Parker","Hey Joseph.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey Robert just a question on the decision to cut some capacity at our fourth quarter. How much of that was planned versus related to some of the operational challenges you're having at LA and then was that decision seen as an EPS accretive action or is that just kind driven by a focus on improving RASM?","Robert Isom","Thanks Joe I appreciate the question, but the capacity that we're planning for the fourth quarter is really a result of all plans and so there's not much that we would say is attributable to anything operationally.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then was that -- was the idea to reduce capacity relative to their prior plan, just designed to improve RASM or was that seen as also beneficial to earnings, just trying to understand the pressure it put on CASM, are you expecting a better increase on the RASM side?","Robert Isom","Look the capacity we have out there we think best meets demand and ultimately we think that's margin accretive and we think we have the right schedule out there for the flying that we can do.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then Derek, you mentioned again that you're carrying some excess liquidity as you get through this CapEx bubble that wraps up next year. What's normal liquidity for you guys look like once you get through that?","Derek Kerr","Well I think as we've said we can go down, our minimum number is going to be about 6.5. We do have some things coming up in 2018 with the pension payments, we've about $1.4 billion pension payment in '18 as we start going forward. So we need to look out all the way through that time period to make sure that we have cash levels at that point and we're very confident where we're at today and we're levels are at today.","So I think we can take it down a little bit from here, but I want to make sure that we get through all of the aircraft purchases next year and then I think it gets into the -- as we said 6.5 is our minimum that we feel we can go down to and we\u2019re significantly above that today, so we\u2019ve opportunities to continue to return cash to our shareholders.","Doug Parker","And just -- this is Doug, just to add on to Derek, so the minimum is I think below that. It's a target and we\u2019d like to keep that we think is a safe amount little bit more than our competitors. That\u2019s what we do rather than what in exchange for having some higher leverage the way we protect ourselves as making sure we have lot more cash coming.","So we have total cash balances of $6.4 billion. We're higher than that now and we\u2019re investing heavily in the airline and our people. We will continue to do so because we\u2019re investing for the future to the extent we continue to be well above that number, that\u2019s we consider our excess cash and we return to our shareholders.","Joseph DeNardi","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thanks. Good morning.","Doug Parker","Good morning.","Hunter Keay","Hey this is a question for Don Casey. Don, I\u2019m going to ask you a very generic question just to get us, I want to hear you talk and so feel free to go anywhere with this, but I\u2019ll just say can you just tell us what you saw on the domestic yield environment as the quarter progressed and may be to understand as you talked about Dallas now that we\u2019re lapping the right amendment, what\u2019s happening in that market and I'll leave it at that. Just talk about Dallas and overall domestic yield thanks. ","Don Casey","On the domestic front as we went through the quarter, we saw improving near term yield. So yields start to improve across the domestic business starting in August and from a RASM perspective we saw improved yearend RASM build going back to April.","As for Dallas in particular, in August the last tranche of the Southwest expansion for Dallas and when we look at the Dallas performance right now, it's really in line with performance across the rest of the system.","Hunter Keay","Good, thanks and then little more on debt Derek, Scott said you don't believe artificial debt targets. Your stock has been doing nicely, your RASM is getting better at a certain point here, people are going to start moving away from it if you're not, I think perceived to be taking a more assertive approach on your balance sheet.","Again next three, six months as RASM gets better, that\u2019s fine, but you\u2019re running the risk of people transitioning to more quality stocks in the space if you will if you're not taking an assertive approach on debt. So, may be talk about rather than just talking about liquidity, let\u2019s talk about debt holistically and is there any thoughts of providing making a slide that shows where you want to be on debt targets over the next, two three, four years because it works for Delta and I think it's a nice story to tell for some of the incremental long lease that might be all put off as everybody\u2019s RASM gets better midpoint in next year. Thanks.","Doug Parker","Hey let me start. This is Doug, so -- and then Derek can provide details, but first off I would just, frankly we don\u2019t agree with the premise and shareholders can make their own decisions obviously based upon what we do, but our view is the best thing for our shareholders is to ensure that we have sufficient amount of liquidity to withstand any sort of downturn, but the cost of getting to or worrying about credit ratings is in a business where we're borrowing against aircraft as 3% doesn\u2019t necessarily -- actually doesn\u2019t seem to be that go in and of itself, doesn\u2019t seem to be in our shareholder's best interest.","So somewhat -- it somewhat surprised with shareholder with the people like you would push back on this, because we think we\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for our shareholders. At the end of the day, we're producing -- we are producing profits at levels this industry has never seen but consistent with what other industries do.","We\u2019re very bullish on our ability to continue doing that over time. As we do so, the first thing we do is invest back in our company. This company needs a good bit of investment. We are investing at levels that no airlines ever invested before. The aircraft monetization I talked about has now at aircraft levels that are at age levels that are well below our competitors something like around 10 years and falling for 16, 17 years and increasing for them and then investing on top of that something as Derek said $1.5 billion next year on improvements in the airline.","Those are good investments and we\u2019re excited about those and those will provide returns for our shareholders. Those are long lived assets that we're not off spending it on ancillary businesses or trying to do something we\u2019re not, we're doing what we think is right and we feel very good about that. That investment will now return for shareholders. Once we do that then we look to make sure we've paid down any high cost that we done that.","Derek and his team has done a phenomenal job of getting to while we have a larger amount of debt in the balance sheet and appear the cost that debt is low and as we look to each -- the incremental decision by the way comes down to that. We\u2019re adding airplanes as we do this monetization.","Should we use our cash balance to pay for those aircrafts or should we avail ourselves of 3% debt and we think the best thing for our shareholders is to avail ourselves of the 3% debt. That leaves us with cash balances that are in excess of the target and we think the right thing to do with that is to return it to our shareholders, but the way we protect ourselves is having a much higher liquidity balance then others.","That\u2019s the cost of it, but it\u2019s a much, much costly thing then paying -- then not availing yourself of low cost debt and the other point I want to make is even if we did those things, even if we started paying cash per aircraft we still have higher debt. It's going to be better assets. ","When you have airplanes that are nine years old but somebody else with 17 years old, you're going to have higher debt because you have much better assets and they\u2019re going to be here for a long time as are we and that\u2019s what why we're doing this. So you're right. This is -- we believe we\u2019re in the right spot. We\u2019re very comfortable with our leverage. We\u2019re very comfortable with the balance sheet and we\u2019re doing the right thing for our shareholders.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning everybody. Doug your pretax margins at now the lowest in the business, dropping below those of United for the first time in a long time, do you expect to remain the worst in the business?","Doug Parker","And that\u2019s seasonal -- no is the answer, but I expect which you'll see in '17 is to do better than our competitors in terms of certainly year-over-year margins. You've seen it already in the RASM and that will continue into '17.","You'll see on the cost front as Derek noted the reason the margins declined even though we\u2019re having better RASM now of course is because our CASM is up more, that\u2019s because we\u2019ve gone and taken care of our people faster and gotten ourselves to a point where we have in every workgroup, less than three years since the merger we now have everyone on new pays scale that reflect the they're doing for us and that\u2019s increased our cost but they're well below.","We had to do that. We're happy we did that. Our shareholders should be happy we did that but it's behind us now. We have one of those that was done midyear which is the TWI Derek talked about so that will have a year-over-year impact, but it's in the current cost structure and beyond that we haven't seen any sort of other cost increase, certainly over and above inflationary rates in the airline. So, I think what you\u2019ll see as we go through '17 is better revenue PRASM improvement on a year-over-year basis and better cost performance as well.","Jamie Baker","Okay. I appreciated it and Robert I continue to purchase the absolute lowest fares that American intends to publish because I can. As I noted on Delta\u2019s call I\u2019m prohibited from doing so, when flying them because economy basic is rolled off.","Can you give us an update on the timing and any potential earnings magnitude that you would associate with rolling out a similar ULCC matching de-contented product however you refereed to internally.","Robert Isom","Thanks Jamie so, basically we\u2019ve been working on for some time and we\u2019re on track. We\u2019re prepared to launch at the end of this year, but right now our game plan is going to be hold off on that and to go and to start to roll out in January. This comes a little bit from my operations background when avoid the holidays and disruption to our folks and so we\u2019re on track and ready to go, but any details on that and you\u2019re going to have until we roll out and we're not at this time making any projections on revenue performance associated with the product.","Jamie Baker","In light of the no answer, can I just ask the inevitable question if you aggregate November, December and January on a domestic basis. will RASM be positive or negative?","Don Casey","This is Don I will answer that.","Jamie Baker","Hi Don.","Don Casey","But when we looked at the entire system, so not just domestic, but look at the entire system from November through January we would expect our overall TRASM performance to be flat to slightly positive.","Jamie Baker","Excellent, thank you everybody. ","Doug Parker","Thanks Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. ","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, thanks for the time first question just in terms of the guide for 4Q how conservative is it just given what we saw the last quarter what are you assuming on the closing side and then any other assumptions that you can share with us would be great. ","Don Casey","This is Don again when we do the forecast we try and pick the midpoint and we did that again this quarter. ","Derek Kerr","Yeah, anyway Raj, I would just point out I mean there is improvement if we had 2.2% PRASM in the third quarter and we giving you 1 to 3 in -- midpoint is to then that\u2019s improvement, slight improvement for us but fact in the fourth quarter year-over-year comp as far as in the third quarter, year-over-year comp is always calendar and having even this same performance third quarter, fourth quarter on year-over-year basis is improvement, it\u2019s we believe our forecast highlights an improving trends is what we\u2019re experiencing. ","Doug Parker","At that due to the holiday shifts, specific of the Christmas holiday shift we expect the impact of that on Q4 PRASM to be one point.","Derek Kerr","Which is moves into the first quarter. ","Doug Parker","It moves in the first quarter so, at a mid point or two absent the holiday shift there would be base business improvement point.","Rajeev Lalwani","Great and then in terms of the capacity growth for next year can you talk about just cadence through next year and then some color on the brick down by region I think you provided some color on Asia which is looking at maybe other parts of the world and then also how did you arrive at flat and domestic grows next year with underpinning that. ","Derek Kerr","Yeah, this is Derek but I think we\u2019re going to have to hold up on that until we get to the we\u2019re still working through it I mean that\u2019s our projection right now as we\u2019re doing our plan so when we get down to the fourth quarter call we\u2019ll give regional and cadence by quarter by as of right now, we just have a full year number and we\u2019re working through the plan so, we just have to wait till the next quarter for that. ","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay, may be just one question and I think you talked about growing a good amount in Asia can you may be just highlight why you are growing so much there is just give some of the process and figures that we saw and that relates to that. ","Derek Kerr","The growth that you see is really as a result of additions that we made this past year. This is we take a look into the next year it\u2019s going to be, going into the services that we\u2019ve put that we think that our network is well suited to support those routes and our customers demand the service there for serving the region in the long run and we\u2019re in the right phase. ","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Linenberg","Hi, hey good morning everybody just a couple here. On the credit card deal with the Master Card explicatively Derek I guess I miss that when the original press release came out I just, I know you had really long term relationship with Visa is there any sort of incremental benefit or with the numbers that you gave us and that was announced that also include moving over to MasterCard from Visa. ","Derek Kerr","That includes moving over to MasterCard.","Mike Linenberg","Okay. Great and then just my second question on for Bob, Robert we talked about basic economy and rolling that out in early 2017 I guess can you talk about the international premium economy which I believe is actually rolling out this week and how long it\u2019s going to take to ramp up across your international system and what should think about the potential revenue upside from putting this product out across your fleet and by the when do you get it fully up in running. ","Derek Kerr","For international premium economy the great news is that we\u2019re seeing as come out of on our 787, 900 deliveries which is a fantastic news and those ramp and we\u2019ll have critical master to start selling right now you can buy into those seats which is good news as we get to the point of being able to offer consistently next year will be able to start selling the premium economy cap.","Doug Parker","Yeah, mike it\u2019s a that we are doing the modifications we have to go through on all of our white body aircraft the ones that aren\u2019t delivered with it. The one that of the biggest portion of them will start coming in '18 so, we\u2019ll have all of those aircraft going through mod in '17.","So, we will monetized those seats through probably MCE, the main cabin extra product that we have today until we get to the critical mass and then we\u2019ll be able to put up roll out the premium economy so I think that it\u2019s more of an '18 impact that is '17 impact due to having modify all of our white body aircraft for that product.","Don Casey","This is Don. I just add that we\u2019ve also we\u2019ve to actually create the infrastructure and say but sell the fourth cabin and that\u2019s a big IT project that\u2019s underway right now and then we\u2019re expected to have that completed in early next year and we\u2019ll start selling the fourth cabin in mid February for flights beginning of April. ","Mike Linenberg","When we think about the magnitude kind of the run rate on this, this is like a [$1.750 billion] type program on its up and running is that or to might just we had of the ballpark on that. ","Derek Kerr","Mike, we\u2019ve given those numbers hundreds of millions of dollars, I think quite comfortable to seeing that, it\u2019s a great product for our customers in addition we see correctly why we saw this is being able to look at our partners information be doing the similar planning as we -- and getting higher RASM because of this product it helps the number of ways we excited about it\u2019s certainly as, it\u2019s a meaningful impact to our customers and to our revenues. ","Mike Linenberg","And I\u2019m looking for to it for as well. Thanks Doug.","Derek Kerr","Thanks Mike.","Operator","And our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker","Thank you, operator. Hi guys thank you for the time here so, I have just a couple of questions. The first is do you have to make any changes in IT to accommodate the both the DoT issued yesterday with respect to on time performance specifically.","Derek Kerr","Perhaps we don\u2019t know yet -- it is not material versus all the other stuff we have IT group doing in terms of integration otherwise there maybe something that, that\u2019s not large as\u2026","Helane Becker","Okay. And then my second question is when you think about your headcount I know you guys have talked about at being over stocked as you work through all the integration so as we look ahead to may be 2018 and there is I assume we\u2019re going to reduce to -- and what\u2019s like the normalize level we should be thinking about?","Derek Kerr","Let\u2019s work through and give you the numbers overtime I\u2019m not sure we know that number yet but we know is we do indeed have, because we\u2019re still not fully integrated number of areas around the company where we not just more people with resources that we need in all sources of areas so, we will make sure, we do it in a way that\u2019s as quickly as we can and also in way that\u2019s takes care about employee is really important to us so.","That\u2019s a big project for us through 2017 I wouldn\u2019t expect it would be able to yield major cost savings in 2017 because we still to be run, we are on good part of 2017 that\u2019s a big focus of the teams efforts to move forwards to be sure but we are indeed and -- and team to make sure we don\u2019t get to have one airline and still have the infrastructure of two.","So we work through it as we know more let you know but that it's not significantly we\u2019ve talked about it. It's something is going to be able to yield some nice cost improvements and it should part of why our cost are where they are right now because we're running through separate airlines in a lot of areas and we'll work through that as we go through 2017.","Helane Becker","Okay, and then just -- the other question I just had was with the Atlantic and your joint venture with BA and Iberia and the other carriers have you been able to think through what the right level of capacity has given the huge increase in capacity from what I would call low fare in other airlines on the North Atlantic this past summer and what it's likely to be next summer? Maybe too far away, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re giving it some thought.","Derek Kerr","I am going to try and then Don can chime in if I am not, but we haven't cared for a lot of our capacity of course, capacity plans based upon others. What we know is while those other carriers are having an impact what we fly is incredibly important to American Airlines and don\u2019t have any material plans to do anything other than what we\u2019re doing right now and plan to continue to do so. It\u2019s a huge part of our network and important part of our network and important to our customers and the relationship with BAs, Iberia is a very important one.","So as capacity comes on from others of course, yields solve and we work through those things, but I don\u2019t expect you'll see us just decide to we're the ones that you should be looking to impaired our capacity going. Don?","Don Casey","Yeah, I'll just add in the upcoming winter season, we\u2019re actually reducing our capacity by 6% and so we are taking some action and those capacity reductions are focused on markets what are -- we face with structural challenges but where we have partners and we continued to maintain at capacity going forward. ","Helane Becker","Great, thank you for your help.","Derek Kerr","Thanks, Helane","Operator","And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, good morning. Nice to speak with you on a Thursday for changes it\u2019s a good format. I just wanted a follow up to actually where Joe started the conversation on capacity if we look at this year I think you started out about 3% and we\u2019re finishing up about a 140 basis points of that.","Could you quantify how much of that was due to regional supply constrains and I wonder if you would willing to get specific on Republics restructuring. What were the aircraft you expected to be flying in the original plan that went away.","Don Casey","Yeah, Duane I think it would be hard for us to pick that out right now, but it's our reductions really result of not only a little bit due to regional supportability due to pilot concerns but also south American concerns and then adjustment throughout the system so, I think where we stand right now is what we need to be and we got the fleet and that network that\u2019s meeting the demand we think that's out there.","Derek Kerr","In the reduction of course we're still increasing, it's not increasing our rate but at one point in the future, we forecast we would be -- so it\u2019s not because of aircraft numbers, it's because of utilization of aircraft and we respond to demand.","So that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on here going for the most part. We look out a few quarters and think where we may be based on the aircraft we have and what we have comment and then as we get closer and see what\u2019s happening with demand, we may make schedule changes and that\u2019s what's happened here.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. I may follow up on -- I thought you had mentioned some impact from Republic previously but I can follow-up\u2026","Don Casey","Duane this is overall of the shortfall about a third of that comes from total regional issues some of that is of course republic, some of it is usually associated with pilots who fly it, other partner regional and our wholly owned as well.","Robert Isom","And Joe, this is Derek, we did put in our Q that we have reached agreement with Republic on our go-forward plan which did take out about 20-25 aircrafts out of the contract and so we reach that agreement with them obviously they still have a process to go through to get out of bankruptcy but our deal moving forward has reduced aircraft in we\u2019re in pretty good job and was in where we\u2019re at with the republic.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay, that\u2019s great and then Robert I wanted to ask you a question kind of old or structure versus new or structure what were some of the less than optimal aspect of getting a network plan from the other side of the house and then you having deliver that from an operational perspective and I guess more importantly what are the implications of an engineer and that in a very flattering way of an engineer and now owning both of the network plan and ops.","Don Casey","Duane, thanks look, our company has been so focused on integration merger huge initiatives, that the adjustments that we made in terms of worst structure really design now that we\u2019re getting past somebody of major integration milestones to start looking at how we can really optimize the running the company day-to-day and to do that we know that we got to collaborate and we all have to be focus on the same goals.","And I think we gotten odd structure and fantastic people running each of the operating goods and they\u2019re committed to doing that and so you know any difficulties we\u2019ve had, I think we\u2019re just going to be more well suited to collaborate, communicate and make sure that were all line going forward. ","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. I think you answered half of that but I appreciate the talking.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Good morning. Thanks for the time so, I guess just following up on that last question for moment Robert now that your new role has the strategy at all changed with the as far as the competition with you ULCCs and your markets and then as you look at your network today are there any specific items or projects now that you are in you new role that you look to sort of undertake over the next 12 months. ","Derek Kerr","So thanks for the question. Hey look I\u2019ve been part of this management team since the -- go so, in terms of how we go to market and strategies that we\u2019re intending to pursue I feel like I\u2019ve done part of those and the direction that were isn\u2019t going to change we\u2019re going to be incredibly competitive with all commerce especially in our Hut and so you won\u2019t see much of a change in terms of philosophy as we go to the marketplace and compete. ","Yeah, in terms of going forward there is things we wanted to do, we wanted to certainly excel that one of them is running a fantastic airline one that is best in the business on all levels and that\u2019s operational as well as revenue performance and certainly from the perspective of meeting customers\u2019 expectations that\u2019s going to require that we really engage all of our people in a way that we haven\u2019t before and I do view going forward that one of the that primary point of emphasis that we\u2019re going to make is involving all of our people and making sure that they are equipped and well trained and treated in a fashion where, they help us outperform the industry. ","So from there is a lot of other things that we have going on, certainly we want to make sure that we have all of our forward looking\u2019s strategies as alliance partners our network in the best fashion but it all leads to the same place which is having the best network to best people and best product for our customers. ","Jack Atkins","Okay. Great.","Doug Parker","Hey, Jack, its Doug that\u2019s a great answer but also as well as much timing a little bit on the specifically on the ULCC where we said there is absolutely no change and we need we have to compete aggressively on price against here is like that and when they add place to our hub and we actually have a competitive advantage because we have so much connecting activity and the one game changer, may be a big -- but actually a certainly an improvement and how we can do that and still not, and still be as good for American Airlines is can be -- is basic economy and so that product we have in place we\u2019ll allow us to do just that but not have the same amount of dilution we have to American Airlines. So the impact to the spirits of the frontiers will be the same.","We've aggressively matched our prices, but since -- as we put that product in place it will have some attributes that some of our customers would rather don\u2019t care the purchase or want to purchase other attributes for more and right now as we match pretty much, we\u2019re not able to do that.","So that will allow us to do what we\u2019re doing today, continue to do what we\u2019re doing today which as Robert says what we\u2019re going to do, but also do it in a way that allows us to provide another more utility to our customers and give them a product in addition to the one with absolutely lowest fare.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Great. Thank you, Doug and Robert and I guess just as a follow-up question, it seems as though with whether it's cabin segmentation or international revenue opportunities or reducing redundancies in the organization over the next couple of years there is a huge revenue and cost opportunity at American which should drive significant profitability.","And I\u2019m just curious as you guys think about how to communicate that going forward, is there going to be may be an opportunity for us get from you guys detailed financial targets long term because I think that would really help folks to understand the earnings power here. ","Doug Parker","Okay, thanks for the comment. We\u2019ll take it under advisement I understand the value that could provide, just know that I\u2019ve been doing this way long and I\u2019m often reluctant to do depends on how we define the targets, but what I don\u2019t like doing is suggesting that we can predict the future in this business.","It is in incredibly volatile. It will be volatile. I think it will be profitable. I think its dramatically changed the volatility hasn\u2019t changed. So we sometimes are less comfortable than others trying to set things like margin targets, when we know that something effect those margins are outside of our control primarily the economy in fuel prices so, I tell you this.","We couldn\u2019t feel better about American Airlines' future and its financial future and what I also will tell you that based on what we think about the future and we this were extremely bullish on the American stock which is why we continue to purchase at level we do and because as we look out targets or no targets our projections are even in the difficult economic environments have this company be a nice profitable.","And it doesn\u2019t feel like our stock reflects that. So, we we\u2019re happy to give you that guidance and let you go set your own numbers but what we do we\u2019re management company is make sure we\u2019re optimizing for the long term and we\u2019re doing all those things but we\u2019re remiss to trying to tell you that when we had those up it looks like to us and therefore here is what we will produce because we know there is a lot of volatility and what we\u2019re able to produce and our job is to make sure that we can manage around that volatility.","We can we\u2019re excited about that but we're to see we can give you some more guidance we have in the past about longer term but just understand that\u2019s our concern.","Jack Atkins","Okay, great. Thanks again for the time.","Doug Parker","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates","Thanks for taking my question.","Derek Kerr","Hi, Julie.","Julie Yates","Derek can you talk about the opportunities on the cost side now that the integration is largely behind you we seen structural cost reduction programs a few years after the other mergers then, when do you think American could announce something similar and where more specifically or some of the opportunities. ","Don Casey","Yeah, I think as we, we talked about on the call we\u2019re going to be going through '17 from -- we have talked about having excess headcount in certain areas just duplication of work just because we're running two different airlines. That\u2019s the primary area that we'll work on as we move forward.","As we said in the call I think we\u2019re going to look at stuff starting in '17 and it will start to affect us in '18. So, I think what we want to do is we\u2019re going to go through the budget in '17, we going to see where everything is and then try to work with each one of the teams to figure out how we take that over the time period into '18, but I think it\u2019s more as we talked about in '18 issue than it is a '17 issue.","Mostly in efficiencies of trying to run through different airlines, all throughout the company is not just one point, it's all throughout the company as we've tried to get ourselves where we want to be from an airline and running the best airline we can. ","Julie Yates","Okay and then just a question on capacity in Latin America you guys have obviously taken a lot of capacity and you certainly seen the benefits of that today how are you thinking about presuming growth now that entity has turned and you worried about late in capacity coming back in next year. ","Robert Isom","Hey Julie its Robert its -- its wait and see we\u2019re pleased with that the science of growth and we\u2019re going to hold on to that for while and see where things go. ","Julie Yates","Okay and one final one Robert, when would you expect the trends at Atlantic PRASM 2 tends to flatten out. ","Derek Kerr","We do not see it in the foreseeable future, capacity in the first quarter, industry capacity is going to be a 7% and we don\u2019t see signs of that abating and until that abates it's going to be hard to see a positive trajectory in the Atlantic.","Julie Yates","Okay. Thanks very much.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Doug Parker","Hello Dan.","Dan McKenzie","Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess just to be for Robert or Don, does the revenue guide factory in the potential loss of a coach here with Alaskan and how material could that impact be if it's lost?","Robert Isom","Revenue guidance does not and I don\u2019t think if we didn\u2019t change and so wouldn\u2019t be - impact doing that\u2026","Dan McKenzie","Okay. And then I guess Doug or Derek my question was on debt as well. So we all know absolute debt levels are higher than they have been historically but with respect to the underlying business I wondered if you could just help investors understand the leverage metrics relative to where they have been historically may be on an American standalone basis.","So leverage metrics today relative to some average over some carried of time that make sense and as you look at those metrics as you feel comfortable about those metrics is that you expect profits to continue growing faster than the debt and wondered if you could just help us understand, what are those metrics look like under your stress test.","Doug Parker","Sure, thanks for bringing it back to because now when I said -- comfortable. What I meant was we\u2019re comfortable where it is at this time because looking in the future what we expect to just see those metrics continue to improve and I want to suggest we comfortable keeping with there. Although will may be and but the reason we\u2019re comfortable with them at this time is because what you say we have very good line of sight as to what our capital requirements are going forward.","We have a very, we feel good about our certainly even on a very on in difficult economic times, stress testing against the recession about what our earnings would do and as we go forward. So, those that gives us comfort that we\u2019re in a good spot right now and when things come up like 2% interest it seems to be an absolute brainer to us, the right thing to do is to take those debt on rather than using cash to pay airplanes and use that cash were appropriate.","So that\u2019s what we are comfortable about. What happens overtime I would expect and again without giving him targets and use you will see certainly that the metrics that are tied and coverage ratios for example that tie earnings to that levels you could see those better overtime, earnings better and then as their earnings get better and then debt get\u2019s lower.","We are also I should note while we are well head of everyone in terms of modernizing our fleet and it will kind of time that we gotten that done and that\u2019s to some future and you won\u2019t see the decade and continued to so debt get\u2019s lower overtime and earnings continued to even to our margins center stay where they are. You will see those numbers get better that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable where we are today.","And we think we are today we because of the reason I said and we have the right structure in place. We too as a insurance material lot more cash than others but we think that\u2019s a better way to do this for our shareholders and able to pay cash 3%.","Dan McKenzie","Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Thanks for the time and Doug just two follow up on some of your comments around aircraft age and I know you inherited a significant majority of your order book from your predecessor but if the long term plan to maintain the same relative age advantage over your competitors you have today because I think you doing so would imply much different longer term CapEx profile then allowing if lead edge\u2026","Doug Parker","Yes, aircraft age is not a metric that we look at to measure versus our competitors I just point out where it is and but we don\u2019t have goal to say we need to be below the other aircraft age but its noteworthy.","But I think we will get to conversations about relative debt levels to point out how much stronger asset base is mine and the best way to communicate to point out how much younger our fleet is, it look it is a is absolutely customer advantage when you get one - new airplanes - there is no doubt and that is much better in flight product and you can tell the difference.","And so we feel good about that and that you are right, the orders were in place and they\u2019re coming and we\u2019re taking them and but the bigger point that they trying to make here is these are if you look in the very near term, you may say 'Oh my gosh, they have always debt, these are 25 years assets and those airlines have 17 year old airplanes won't be able to have 42 year old airplanes, 25 years from now.","So at some point my point is were ahead of them and suggesting they need to go spending almost not a capital very near term and but they\u2019ll need to do something and we won\u2019t have to at the point, the way that's worked.","So anyway our goal is to make sure we have the absolute young as its nice when you are in the position but to the extent you want to look at relative debt levels, you need to look at the asset base. Our asset base is just tremendously more.","Darryl Genovesi","Great, thanks for that. And then I guess if I just ask you on or maybe Robert or whoever wants to comment, can you just give us some sense of how your view on your Phoenix hub is evolving given your recent emphasis on Los Angeles and the existing presence in Dallas?","Robert Isom","Thanks. Appreciate it. Phoenix hub does well for us. It serves the same purpose that we did it as over - since the start of the merger and it\u2019s a great connecting half, it's got a growing metro area and its serving our network very well.","Darryl Genovesi","Great, thank you.","Doug Parker","International gateway that we -- and I\u2019m looking to expand but they\u2019re complimentary not\u2026","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning everyone. Just one question for Robert, I guess when I look at your on time performance they really start to lag both your network appear starting about six months ago or so. Is there a reason for this is anything going on with the integration that would have caused and I can imagine that it's all the LA issues that you mentioned in your prepared remarks.","And I know you mentioned solid corporate share earlier but have you heard anything from your corporate customers on this performance. Thanks.","Robert Isom","The answer in terms of corporate customers, the answer is no. We haven\u2019t heard anything we\u2019re performing very well as I said in my remarks with our corporate business. So in terms of the summer and the fall up, that\u2019s really where I look at things and associated with the schedule were I think we just quite frankly we were pretty aggressive in terms of the schedule that we put out this summer, we had issues in Los Angeles, we definitely had I think in order in amount of weather issues associated with the DFW and then Chevrolet in Miami and that was problematic.","So it seem like we\u2019re in a recovery phase a lot of during the summer. As I said before we have a lot of integration tools that we didn\u2019t have that we will in the future and that is on building airline back after disruption and making sure our customers and their baggage is taking care of.","One of the things you will note though is we continued to be really strong in terms of our departing on time performance these your performance that\u2019s something that we continued to see and I think that will translate into more competitive arrivals within 14 performance and you'll us as well that our completion factor as we move from operating two systems and really three systems in regard to our pilots down to one that we got a chance to much, much better.","So I'm optimistic of where we headed and if you take a look at where we at right now schedule reductions associated with the fall season with the changes to our Los Angeles operation. We are operating back at new record levels and that should continue and again as I said before all efforts are focused on making sure that we worked together to put out a schedule in 2017 that we can operate lively and competitively with the best in business.","Andrew Didora","Great, thank you.","Operator","And that ends the analyst questions. We will now take the questions from media. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles","Hello good morning. I would like to follow up a little bit on Helane Becker's question regarding the possibility reducing headcount and how that might be done in 2017. Are you looking at actually doing sort of any lay off reduction in force particularly headquarters where you may have overlapping function as you operate, as you go from operating two lines down into one can you give a little more color or detail on that.","Doug Parker","Sure, absolutely not, but glad you asked. We made it sound that way. We have through pockets of the airline in different groups we will have, we have because we're running two airlines people that are -- where we have more people we elevate other one. But we will manage that over time through attrition. If it makes sense, if it's a labor group or layouts whatever works for our people to make sure we do that.","We don't have any intention nor do we care to go through like you described, we'll do this in a way that works for our team.","Andrea Ahles","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News","Mary Schlangenstein","Hi. So I want to follow-up on Andrew's question, do you guys have some sense of the number of physicians that you're talking about that you have redundancy across your workforce.","Doug Parker","Nothing we can talk about yet. Again this is more of a beyond 2017 initiative. We're going to do the work through 2017. We still do have two airlines to our customers we know, but we still have two fleets. So it's not integrated. While we have that going on, we can't do any of this work what we never did in 2017 to figure out where it is and as we know more, we'll let people know.","The good news in this is we have regular attrition rights and we have ways to -- we let people look to retire early and we'll work through those things as it becomes an issue. Right now we're just -- the reason we mentioned it is simply because it's important to the analyst community to understand that that will be something that comes beyond 2017.","Mary Schlangenstein","Right. So you will only consider things like early retirements, buyouts to know involuntary furloughs is what you're saying.","Doug Parker","Yes. As we sit here today that's what I speak it's correct. Conditions can change and also I want to make this sound like some enormous number of people. So we have pockets of people throughout the organization and as I said and we will work through to make sure this works out for those who are either looking to leave or want to leave on their own as they -- as we have natural attrition with more places.","Mary Schlangenstein","Yes.","Doug Parker","So this is nothing about furloughs and layoffs, all about the fact that as you move from two airlines to truly one airline, we will be able to get some cost efficiencies.","Mary Schlangenstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we have Edward Russell with Flightglobal.","Edward Russell","Hi thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a bit more about the premium economy roll out on the rest of the wide body fleet. You outlined target of getting it done in 2017. I wanted to with the business class roll out that ended up being delayed. How do you plan to achieve the roll out in 2017?","Robert Isom","So Edward the premium economy is actually going to go on our A330 200 fleet, the 777-200s, 777-300s and then our 787 fleet, and as we have said 787-9s are starting now and as Don mentioned, we should have for sale in terms of a different class of service next year, but reconfigurations are going to take place over the course of the next really 18 months, 24 months. So we're not going to be ready along all those fleets until June of 2018.","Edward Russell","Okay. Got it thank you and how many roughly, how many do you forecast the reduction in number of economies seats on these aircrafts as you make the modifications or you assume they're going to be neutral?","Robert Isom","I think we're talking about a row generally. I think so that will vary on different aircraft types, but that should be about the way it rolls out.","Edward Russell","About the economy, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Conor Shine with Dallas Morning News.","Doug Parker","Hi Conor.","Conor Shine","Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the improving TRASM trend. What are the kind of the factors that are driving that improvement? Is it just the reduction in capacity growth going forward or are there other elements to that?","Doug Parker","Don do you want to take?","Don Casey","Sure, there are two areas that really kind of driving the growth. One is Latin American and Latin American both Brazil where we've seen 25% increase in the revenue year-over-year, Mexico is performing strongly and we got positive revenue growth in Mexico and Venezuela is contributing to overall unit revenue growth as well.","Domestic business the trend there really has been positive. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen close in yields strength. We've also seen a stabilized pricing environment that's been pretty tumultuous this year but as of late July I can even doubt that when we look at the domestic business from O&D perspective we're seeing kind of the best and strongest yield performance in connecting in oil markets and domestic business which ties a little bit back my earlier comments on pricing.","And also we're seeing the benefits now of the credit card deal that we did in the second quarter as well.","Conor Shine","Good. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Ted Reed with The Street.","Ted Reed","Thank you. I just had a couple questions about Latin America, some just answered, but are these gains in Latin America are they sustainable? How much of an edge did they give you over your competitors with less presence in Latin America and also when are you going to be able to make money in Cuba and will this be a factor in improving PRASM in Latin America or will it be will be less valuable there.","Don Casey","This is Don again, when we look at the trends in Latin America, we would expect Brazil is a big factor obviously in the overall result and we're expecting our performance in Brazil in the fourth quarter to be better materially better than the performance in the third quarter. So we think our performance in Latin America overall is going to continue to get that.","Now for Cuba, I think everything is struggling a little bit in terms of selling in Cuba, there are a lot of restrictions that are still in place that made it difficult to sell. Right now we're seeing greatest strength in terms of forward-booking in the Havana markets where we've had our long presence with our charter operation. But I think Cuba is going to be a bit of a long road I think.","Doug Parker","We're in for the long haul. It's not something we didn't expect. This is really a new market and so at any rate we're excited to be the largest carrier there. We're committed to Cuba and making it work and we'll work through the startup to get into the point where eventually where we all expect we'll be. Excited about the start of Havana on November 30.","Ted Reed","All right. Quickly most I assume the vast majority of sales are in the U.S. in Miami.","Doug Parker","Yes they are.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Dan Cravens for any additional or closing remarks.","Doug Parker","This is Doug. Thanks everybody. Again look the story to this from my perspective listening to all this is you know is the team when we did this merger less than three years ago the biggest questions we get on this call was concerns about our ability to manage the integration and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the work the team has done to get through flawlessly things like PSS and this is now five. So the delays here has helped us has managed us as a full team effort which is why it's so hard.","It takes cross functional work when people are trying to actually do their full jobs there. So we're elided that that concern we've been able to take off your list of concerns and that's important but what is more important about is it shows what a great team we have here and the things we can do and now with much of that work behind not all of it but much of it behind us, we are extremely excited about everything that we have going on particularly the investments we are making in our people and our product that will accrue to our customers and the upside that provides us but we're in this for the long-term, we're excited about the long term and we appreciate your support thanks.","Operator","And that concludes today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"1311":["American Airlines Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Q3 2017 Earnings Call October 26, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Daniel E.

Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead.","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us in the room today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, the President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our Q&A session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.","We're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risk and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning, and as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website at aa.com.","A webcast of this will also be archived on the website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on. It's not possible to talk about the third quarter without beginning with the hurricanes and what our team did in regard to those events. We're always proud of our team, but particularly so this quarter. They rallied around each other, they rallied around our customers, just showed incredible care and concern and made a huge difference and it's times like this that the people of American shine and they certainly did in the third quarter and we're so proud of them and appreciative and I should also note, as proud as we are as the people of American, this is not a time for all of our competitive juices to get too strong.","Our industry did a great job in this regard and we're proud of everyone in the industry for what they all did including our competitors. We made a big difference, we continue to make a big difference and we're proud of that and extremely thankful and appreciative of our team.","We had an investor day not too long ago, just last month, Investor and Media Day. It was very productive and helpful. Thank you for all \u2013 thanks to all of you who attended. During that Investor Day, we laid out some themes that are important to us. We talked about how we are playing for the long game, how we are running our own show, focused on American and not defining ourselves on others, looking to make long-term decisions and not be overly focused on near-term metrics. Those themes continue, of course, we're not going to go through them in great detail, but you will hear them running through all of our comments throughout this call.","We also laid out four long-term strategic objectives consistent with those themes. Those are to build a world-class product, to drive efficiencies, to make culture a competitive advantage, and to think forward and lean forward. We are, again, those are themes you'll hear us continue to bring up because we like the framework and we're excited about the message.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to Derek to give you some details on the numbers and then Robert will give more details as well.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","Good. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. And before I begin, I'd also like to thank our more than 120,000 team members. The third quarter brought more than its fair share of weather and operational challenges and our team delivered. Robert and I were both in Miami shortly after Hurricane Irma and witnessed firsthand how our team came together to take care of our passengers and each other. The teamwork demonstrated by everyone at American made us all proud.","As Doug mentioned, we filed our earnings press release and 10-Q this morning and in that release, our third quarter 2017 GAAP net profit was $624 million, or $1.28 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $737 million or $1.40 per diluted share. Excluding special items, we reported a net profit of $692 million in the third quarter 2017 versus our third quarter 2016 net profit of $933 million. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $1.42 per share versus $1.76 in the third quarter of 2016.","Our GAAP third quarter 2017 pre-tax profit was $1 billion. Excluding net special items, our third quarter pre-tax profit was $1.1 billion, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 10.2%.","Looking at revenue, our total third quarter operating revenues were up 2.7% year over year to $10.9 billion. Passenger revenues were $9.4 billion, up 2.5% on a yield improvement of 1.6%. Cargo revenues were up 17% to $200 million, due primarily to higher volume. Our other revenues were $1.3 billion, up 2.2% year over year, due primarily to higher baggage and frequent flyer revenue.","Total GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $9.6 billion, up 5.3% versus the same period last year. This increase was due primarily to a 13.3% increase in consolidated fuel expense and higher salaries and benefits expense as a result of the mid-contract base-pay increase given to our pilots and flight attendants earlier this year, as well as rate increases for our maintenance and fleet service team members that became effective mid-third quarter last year.","Third quarter consolidated ASMs, cost per ASM, was $0.132, up 3.6% year over year. Excluding fuel and special items, our consolidated CASM was $0.1043, up 4.5% year over year due primarily to the salary and benefit increases I mentioned earlier. We ended the third quarter with approximately $8.3 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $5.8 billion and $2.5 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also has a restricted cash position of $393 million.","Since our last call, our Treasury team has been very busy. They completed another set of efficient financing transactions, including the 2017-2 EETC, AA- and A-tranches, as well as the 2016-3 and 2017-2 EETC B-tranches at very favorable coupon rates for junior subordinated EETC tranches. In addition, the team refinanced and extended the revolving credit facility, upsizing it to $2.5 billion in the process and closed on 5 mortgage transactions and 11 sale-leaseback transactions.","During the quarter, the company returned $411 million to its shareholders including quarterly dividend payments totaling $49 million and a repurchase of $362 million of common stock or 7.7 million shares. Our share count has dropped by 37% from $756 million at merger close in December 2013 to 480 million shares as of September 30.","In addition to our earnings release, we also filed our investor update this morning. Consistent with our previous guidance, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect our system ASM growth to be up approximately 2%, domestic up 0.5%, and international up 5%. For the full year, we continue to expect consolidated system capacity to be up approximately 1%, driven by increasing gauge, about 2.4%; stage length, about 1.5%, offset by 2.7% fewer departures. We expect full year domestic consolidated capacity to be approximately flat year over year and international capacity to be up 4%, primarily driven by the impact of the 777-200 retrofit program, which was completed during the third quarter and year-over-year impact of new destinations across the Pacific.","We expect our fourth quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel and special items, to be up approximately 4.5%, with mainline up 5% and regional up 2%. As we stated in our recent investor day, and consistent with our fourth quarter, we anticipate our unit cost growth rates to continue to trend lower and we expect 2018 full-year nonfuel CASM to increase, excluding the impact of any new labor deals, by approximately 2%.","We are forecasting a material increase in fuels in the fourth quarter. And based on the forward curve as of October 13, 2017, we expect consolidated fuel prices to be up approximately 16% year over year to between $1.81 to $1.86 per gallon on a consolidated basis. Using the midpoints of the cost guidance we provided in the TRASM guidance Robert will talk about a minute, we expect our fourth quarter 2017 pre-tax margin, excluding special items, to be between 4.5% and 6.5%.","As we continue with our fleet renewal program for the full year of 2017, we still expect gross aircraft CapEx to total $4.1 billion, which includes the delivery of 57 mainline aircraft and 16 regional aircraft. In addition, we expect us to invest $1.65 billion in non-aircraft CapEx for integration work and projects to improve our products and operations, a slight increase from previous guidance as we invest heavily in the installation of Premium Economy, narrow-body retrofit programs, updates to our clubs and other initiatives to improve the airline for our team members and customers.","On previous earnings calls, I provided estimates for our 2018 pension contributions as the airline relief legislation ends for us. While our minimum requirement contribution for 2018 are estimated to be only $62 million, we now expect to contribute approximately $780 million in order to maintain an 80% funded status on all of our plans.","We will continue to take a measured approach to matching our plan capacity levels with anticipated levels of demand. We are still in the process of developing our operating plan for 2018, so our formal capacity guidance will come when we report fourth quarter earnings. But on a schedule-over-schedule basis, we currently expect system capacity to be up approximately 2.5% in 2018 on a flat fleet count. We also expect domestic and international capacity to grow at similar levels of approximately 2.5%.","At our recent Investor Day, we also talked about the opportunities provided by our Project One Airline initiative to drive efficiencies. We've identified $1 billion in cost savings that we expect to implement by 2021, driven principally by increased use of technology, changes to process and procedures and further eliminating post-merger redundancies. We are just getting started on these initiatives and will incorporate approximately $200 million of savings in our 2018 plan. I look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls.","So in conclusion, despite the challenges resulting from the three hurricanes, our team has produced another excellent quarter. I would like to thank all of our team members for continuing to take care of our customers and as important, each other.","With that, I will turn the call over to Robert.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Derek. Good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us.","Before I begin my remarks about the third quarter, I'd also like to begin by thanking our more than 120,000 team members for all that they have done during a very challenging quarter. The tragic hurricanes in late August and September caused severe damage and disruption as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria made landfall in the U.S. and Caribbean. American canceled more than 8,000 flights due to the hurricanes and at the peak of the storm activity canceled all flights at nearly 30 stations. We estimate that these storms reduced pre-tax earnings by $75 million.","In particular, I'd like to recognize our team members who endured the hurricanes at our hub in Miami and other airports in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean, as well as those in Mexico City who endured a devastating earthquake. You all have demonstrated courage, leadership, and compassion under extremely trying conditions. Not only did you help our airline get back online, but also and more important, you were all there for each other and for our customers. So a sincere thank you goes out to all of you from your teammates from around the system. You made us all very proud to be part of the American team.","As we discussed at Investor Day a few weeks ago, we have identified $3.9 billion in revenue and cost initiatives that we expect to realize over the next few years. While I won't rehash all of that in detail today, and if it isn't already obvious, we are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We're already on our way with a full launch of Basic Economy across our domestic system on September 5. Our careful planning and measured rollout over the summer has resulted in a very successful launch with no disruption.","Performance has been in line with expectations, with about 50% of customers who received a basic offer choosing to buy up to the main cabin product. Although the rollout was too late to have a material impact on the third quarter of 2017, we do expect this to add revenue momentum to the fourth quarter 2017.","In addition, our Premium Economy product continues to gain traction with an average upsell of approximately $400 each way over the coach cabin. Customer adoption of this highly differentiated product has been strong. As expected, the majority of Premium Economy customers are leisure customers looking for an affordable way to enhance their international flight experience. Premium Economy is now installed on 27 of our wide-body aircraft. And by year end, we expect that number to grow to 63, and by year-end 2018 to over 100 wide-body aircraft.","Operationally, our performance this summer showed significant improvement versus the summer of 2016. Summer on-time departures improved by 3.9 percentage points and arrivals by 3.2 percentage points, bouncing back from a difficult summer of 2016.","In addition, our baggage performance continues to be a focus for our team. This has been a bright spot, as the year-over-year mishandled bag rate has improved each month in 2017. When we do mishandled bags, we're working to minimize inconvenience for customers with the introduction of the new customer bag notification tool, which went live in July of this summer. This tool sends bag notifications to customers and allows them to set up free delivery for delayed bags or advises them to pick up early arriving bags at specific baggage claim locations. The early results are encouraging, as nearly 20% of customers notified of early or delayed bags are using customer bag notification to set up a bag delivery.","Turning to revenue, the demand environment remains robust. And despite the operational challenges and difficult year-over-year comparisons, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter PRASM was up 0.9% and our third quarter TRASM was up 1.1%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for American. Our investments in people, product, and new corporate sales initiatives are beginning to pay off. And when combined with our new revenue management tools, changes to our AAdvantage program, and our new mobile platform, the results are even more encouraging.","In domestic, our consolidated PRASM was up 0.1%. We are very pleased with this outcome, as we faced hurricane impacts to our hub in Miami and had very difficult year-over-year comps due to beneficial pricing actions in the third quarter of 2016. On a year-over-two-year basis, our performance in the domestic market was materially better than our legacy counterparts.","Our Latin American performance overall was very strong, with PRASM up 8.3%. Positive Latin PRASM was driven by strong performance in all entities, consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. This is a great outcome as we have faced difficult conditions due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria.","Atlantic PRASM was up 2.6% year over year. Premium cabin pricing and yield management initiatives, improved share performance with travel management companies, and easing comps from past terror events continue to contribute to 2017 year-over-year PRASM performance.","The United Kingdom is showing the largest PRASM improvement on a year-over-year basis due to improved premium cabin performance. However, the overall environment remains challenged, as low-price carriers grow substantially, resulting in weaker pricing environment for coach travel.","Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 1.6% year over year. Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong were positive, but this was offset by softness in China and Korea.","Third quarter cargo revenue improved 17% year over year on strong volume growth, continuing a positive trend that we've seen since the latter half of 2016.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect our year-over-year TRASM to be up 2.5% to 4.5%, an improvement from our third quarter 2017 performance, as our revenue initiatives will continue to deliver top line benefits.","Regionally, our domestic PRASM is expected to be positive for the fifth consecutive quarter, helped by our launch of Basic Economy. Atlantic performance is expected to be in line with the third quarter, with Pacific improving as we lap the growth of new routes from last year, and we expect the Latin entity to be modestly positive.","And to wrap up my comments and as we covered at our Investor Day, American has a privileged set of assets, our hubs and gateways in the U.S., and a world-class set of partners that extend our network even farther. A hub-and-spoke business model allows us to serve an incredibly broad spectrum of customers, getting them to the places they want to fly with the amenities that they value.","Our strategy investments and the investments that we've made and are making in our fleet, product and especially our team are working, as evidenced by our customer satisfaction metrics and our unit revenue performance versus the industry over the past five quarters and expected outperformance for a sixth quarter to close out 2017. And best of all, there's a lot more to come. And we're excited to deliver all that value for our customers, team members, and shareholders.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Robert.","And before we open up to questions, I want to address an issue that's come up this week, which is the travel advisory from the NAACP. First, that announcement was obviously a disappointment to our team. That's because we at American Airlines pride ourselves on inclusiveness and diversity. What we do as an organization is connect people. We like to say we fly over borders and walls and stereotypes and divisiveness to bring people together. And our team members do that safely and professionally every day. And as a result, we make this world a smaller and more inclusive place.","Once we got past the disappointment, we realized this is a great opportunity. Yes, we're proud of our commitment to equality and diversity and the significant impact we make in that regard around the globe. But discrimination, exclusion, and unconscious biases are enormous problems that no one's mastered. And we would never suggest that we have it all figured out. What we know is we want to keep learning and we want to get even better. We want to be leaders for all of U.S. industry in equality, inclusion, and diversity because we actually think we can make a difference in the world if we do that. And organizations like the NAACP can help us, so we welcome the opportunity to work with them. Indeed, we're excited about it and enthusiastic to sit down and listen and learn together.","We've reached out and expect to begin working together in the very near term. That's good news for the people of American, for our customers, and our shareholders. We look forward to what lies ahead as a result of this effort, and we will keep you apprised as our work develops.","So with that said, Chris, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, I guess two questions here. Derek, I think you threw initially or maybe Robert, the capacity growth for next year, the 2.5% on a flat fleet count. Is that \u2013 I guess is that all gauge, or is there like a departure or stage length element in there as well?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","Mostly gauge, probably 2 points of it gauge and the rest departures.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then probably to Don now, or Robert. Robert, you actually talked about domestic being strong again or positive again for, I guess, the fifth consecutive quarter on the backs of the success or early success that you're seeing with Basic Economy. Whether you or Don can just talk about that rollout. I guess we're six weeks into it, some of the pluses and minuses, any modifications or changes that you've had to implement since the rollout, that would be great. Thanks.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I can start. It's been a smooth rollout. As you know, we took a measured approach with test markets, really made sure that our team out in the field was aware and could handle, and educated on the product, and so far, so good. We don't see a lot of changes and our expectation is to hit the targets that we've talked about. Don?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes, I'd have to say that we introduced a million new fares into the marketplace, right, so that always takes a bit of time to stabilize. But I think we're at a point right now where we're at a stable situation. I think we're probably not quite where the whole industry is probably going to end up from a pricing perspective. But we're kind of happy with where we are right now.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. So maybe this one's for Doug or Robert, but at the Investor Day, I think you guys highlighted to everyone that you've had a lot of internal focus the last couple of years, just bringing U.S. Airways and American together. As you look into 2018 and maybe some of those initiatives come off, what are the big priorities that you guys want to focus on, on improving the experience moving forward?","Operator","And pardon the interruption, Brandon. It looks like the speakers' line has just dropped. I'm going to go ahead and leave the queue as is. I'm going to reintroduce music until the speakers are reintroduced, so pause just a moment.","[Technical Difficulty] (25:07-27:03)","Operator","All right. Brandon, your line is back open. Please restart your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, everyone. I didn't know my question was that bad and gotten involuntarily denied here.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Brandon, we never even heard you. We actually just thought \u2013 once we had given our script and Linenberg asked his question, we were done. But apparently, some other people had more. Sorry, we don't know what happened. But anyway, we're back.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm looking for some denied compensation on this one. But \u2013 listen, guys, my question was really, you talked about all the effort you guys have had internally the last couple years, merging U.S. Airways, American Airlines, and as you look into 2018, I think a lot of those initiatives really trail off. So what becomes more of an internal focus for you guys in 2018 as you can redeploy some people and assets and capital into more productive uses?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, I'll start. Look, our game plan is to really make sure that we make best use of what we've invested in so far. Yes, there's a lot more to come, but we take a look at our aircraft, our fleet, and the opportunity for utilization and deploying aircraft where we think it makes the most sense. And so that all plays into the One Airline initiative as well, where we think that we can grow revenues. We think that we can better utilize our aircraft, facilitate low-cost growth and then ultimately deliver more value overall.","So it fits very well, but really the focus is, if you take a look at what we've laid out so far, is to first deliver on what we've laid out, we've got a couple of things that are still important in terms of integration, and those are: making sure that we get a contract between our mechanics and our fleet service employees and then also making sure that we deliver on getting our flight attendants on one system and really fully integrate them. And then it's really at that point in time, it's a merged airline, able to focus on what we do best, and that's delivering value for our customers.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that, Robert, and I guess as we \u2013 you guys have attributed a lot of your revenue outperformance this year too to some of the changes you've made, I would say in your revenue management system. Should we be thinking next year, though, you don't have that level of outperformance on the industry and so you're going to look much more like the average industry participant? Or are there still levers that you're pulling on the revenue side?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, you saw from our Investor Day that we have a set of initiatives that are laid out. And it deals with everything from revenue management, and Don can speak a little bit about a new optimizer that just came online here recently, to all of our sales efforts and getting back out and really aggressive on that front, to making sure that we're flying and deploying aircraft where they can be best utilized. So we see that all of the initiatives that we laid out is playing out over the next few years and continue to advantage American, and in many cases, uniquely so, because many of these items are, in ways, catch-up. Some of the biggest initiatives that we laid out during Investor Day, everybody's aware of Basic Economy, of course, but Premium Economy is just in its infancy. And if you take a look at where we're headed overall, I feel really confident that we're going to be continuing to outperform.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brandon.","Operator","And our next question comes from Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hunter Keay?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. Hello, Doug Parker, how are you doing? So the 2018 capacity growth, it's about a point higher than I was expecting, which it's my own bad modeling, I guess, but I suppose that makes the CASM ex-guide look that much less good than I thought, or less okay or acceptable. So given that type of capacity growth, and I guess this sort of dovetails a little bit with what Brandon just asked you, but do you still feel like you can grow RASM faster than CASM next year and expect to \u2013 effectively grow margins?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hunter, again, I'll take a shot and the guys can fill in, I guess. First off, we always talk about CASM ex-fuel, of course. So you've got to make your own fuel forecast, but right now, it appears to be up. But if you're talking about...","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","I'm sorry. CASM ex-fuel, Doug. CASM ex-fuel, thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes, so can RASM grow faster than our \u2013 what we have now for our CASM ex-fuel guidance? Again, we're not giving a RASM forecast, but that's certainly been the trend of late and \u2013 anyway, Don, what do you want to say about that?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes, we had, as we kind of finished the third quarter, four consecutive quarters where our performance was materially better than the rest of the industry. And so as we kind of lap that, we still are going to have, in the third quarter, the fourth quarter, revenue that's kind of a bit better than the rest of the industry. And so that, I think, just speaks to the fact that we have a long list of initiatives, right, that are layering on top of one another that continue to drive better unit revenue year over year.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes, and, Hunter, I'll say this. Demand continues to look strong. All the initiatives that we've talked about are \u2013 those aren't things that we hope to get done. They're largely done. They're just kicking in. So we feel very good about that. So I'm happy to tell you \u2013 look, I would be disappointed if our RASM next year didn't exceed our CASM ex-fuel.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Okay. And then on the cash flow, it looks like 2018 is going to be a pretty solid free cash flow for you guys given a few factors, even with the pension contribution. Derek, you said you're comfortable with the leverage levels and you guys are probably not focused on paying a 2.5%, 3% dividend. So is it safe to pencil in a pretty sizable uptick in the buyback relative to 2017, holding all else equal on margin assumptions and everything like that?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hunter, again, make no assumptions. We can tell you what we can tell you, which is we think a minimum cash balance of $7 billion -","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","Liquidity.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Liquidity, I'm sorry, at American, which is awfully high relative to others, anyway, is the right number for us just because of the higher leverage. We think it's a better way to protect ourselves against downturns or any unforeseen circumstances than being less levered. So that's a number we look at as you do your forecast to the extent you see us generating cash levels substantially higher than that. We've always been of the view that once we've invested in our team, once we've invested in the airline, once we've paid down low-cost debt and invested in projects within the airline that can create returns for our shareholders, that the right thing to do is return it to our shareholders. So that would be a rational expectation of where the cash goes. What the actual cash flows are, again, not numbers that we're projecting, but you're welcome to.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, Doug.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Just to go back to Hunter's first question there on CASM, ex. Derek, could you maybe sort of outline a couple of the items that are maybe driving a little bit greater CASM, ex inflation, in 2018 than \u2013 and I guess who would've thought sort of before you provided that guidance? Just trying to think about some of the puts that are offsetting the efficiency gains that you outlined at the analyst day?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes, I mean, there's four things that we believe will be higher next year. I mean, depreciation, of course, because we have the aircraft that are coming in and we have to \u2013 the CapEx that we've had year over year is the depreciation. Our rents and landing fees, I think from that perspective, we project to be from a CASM perspective a little bit up next year. Maintenance has a little bit of headwinds in there. And then, of course, salaries and benefits is the other one. But those four are the areas that we're focused on and that we know will be there next year, but we believe will hopefully offset most of those higher expenses to hit the 2% CASM that we talked about at the analyst day.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just, Doug, I guess for my follow-up question, maybe just a broader question for you. But certainly when you take the items that you guys outlined at the end of September at the analyst day together, it paints, I think, a very optimistic and very rosy outlook for the business as you sort of move forward here, and I think that's being reflected in the stock, starting to be reflected in the stock here. But I guess as you look out to 2018, things are setting out to be quite favorable for you guys, it seems like.","And I guess as you look at the business, what are some of the risks perhaps that you see out there that it could derail the story to some degree? Just trying to think through the risks that could show up next year in what otherwise would be a fairly positive environment for you guys?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. Look, Jack, first off, we're bullish. So it's a fair question, of course, there are always risks. But I want to start out by saying, you're right; we're bullish. We feel really good about where American is. We feel good about the transformation that's taking place in the industry, the kind of risks that you would look at are the kind of things that could always happen in our business, economic downturn, well, the industry has dramatically transformed and stronger than it ever has been and I believe permanently transformed, we're still a cyclical business.","So if there's any sort of economic downturn, that would provide, that would pose some risk to the revenue performance. We're big consumers of fuel and so fuel spikes could have an impact. Again, I would argue spikes are one thing, but it's just increases given where we are, I think what you'd see is fares rise to levels to offset much of the fuel price increase.","So, look, I'm not going to be able to give you anything that's dramatically different than you would find and read in some of these risk factors. Because the real issue is we feel \u2013 we're really bullish. We feel really good about where American is, we feel good about where the industry is.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks again for the time.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Jack.","Operator","And our next question comes from Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Hi, everybody, thank you very much for the time, Doug. So, I just have two questions. One is at Investor Day, you spent a lot of time talking about kind of focusing on the longer term in the outlook kind of beyond maybe 2017 and maybe even beyond 2018. And then on this call, you spend all your time talking about 2017 and 2018.","So I'm just kind of wondering if you can maybe talk about the longer term and tell us what you're thinking about with respect to maybe, I mean, I know you're not going to talk about pricing, but just in terms of where you see American in, say, 2019-2021 timeframe?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helene. And I would love to do that, but I'm conscious of everyone's time. We tried really well to do that during the earnings call. What I'll tell you is, we know who we are. We are a global hub-and-spoke airline with, as Robert said, a set of privileged assets that allow us to do, to provide service to customers that we think is incomparable or certainly hard for others to replicate. And we know there is a good bit of upside in our ability to do that. What you should expect from us over time is an airline that has world-class products.","We know full well that we have to compete for all customers. But first and foremost, we want to make sure that we have an airline that is the airline of choice for business customers, for premium customers. And we're doing \u2013 everything we're working on now is designed to make sure we have a product in place to do that, not the least of which is a significant investment in our fleet, investment in satellite Wi-Fi across all the aircraft, and investment in our clubs, all this work that has just begun in the last couple of years and has the airline already in a much better place today than it was a couple years ago and we'll have it even better in the next couple of years.","We're going to work to make culture a competitive advantage. That as much as anything is where we think the upside is. We have an airline that, because of its history, still has our team members not as engaged and excited as we'd like them to be. And once we have leaders in place that our team knows care about them, that provide the tools to do their jobs the way they know how to do it, that lets them, that appreciates what they do, that helps them understand that what they do is incredibly important, and that they make a difference, so that they go home at the end of the day feeling fulfilled. We know that will have a huge, that won't just be a better airline, that will be an airline that people want to fly and that's a competitive advantage. That's clearly not where we are now, but that's where we're moving.","We're going to continue to drive efficiencies, as Derek showed in our presentation. That includes a lot of work that just happens once we get integrated, but even more so a significant amount of work under the leadership of Maya and the IT team to make sure that we are at the leading edge of technology for our customers and for our team. And we're going to do all that with the mindset of thinking forward and leaning forward, a team that will be making sure that we come out of this past of short-term thinking and have a mindset throughout the organization that is always looking forward and thinking forward, something that we feel pretty good about, but we know we can do even better and we expect to be leaders in that arena.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","So that's a great answer and I really appreciate it. I just have one follow-on question, and that's when you guys talk about the impact of the Middle Eastern airlines on your business, do you think that as your product improves, their relevance in our market dissipates?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Look, the issue with the Middle East carriers is not about their product. That's a symptom of the problem. When you're subsidized and you don't care about making profits, you certainly can put in place a product that's uneconomic because the flying itself is uneconomic. But no, the answer to the Middle East carrier issue is not for us to have a product that competes with them. The answer to the Middle East carrier issue is for them not to be subsidized and for us not to have to compete against countries and for our country to step up and do what it needs to do and make sure that we aren't forced to do that.","One of the biggest threats, if not the biggest threat to everything I just said about the long-term viability of our business is the U.S. government not stepping up and making sure that those two countries aren't allowed to continue to subsidize flying and to jeopardize U.S. aviation jobs. We can compete against anybody as long as the playing field is close to fair. What we can't do is compete against oil-rich countries that don't care about making profits and that seem to have a different objective of trying to help their countries through having an aviation practice that doesn't make any money but brings people in and out of their countries.","So look, the good news on this is we've had productive conversations with the administration, myself as well as the CEOs of American \u2013 CEOs of United and Delta met with some secretaries this quarter and were encouraged by the reception. There's still work to do, of course, but are hopeful because this is as easy as it gets in terms of being able to create a case that shows that American jobs are at stake because of policies of other countries, and we should enforce ours.","So anyway, that's not a product issue, that's a subsidization issue and a really, really important one that we're screaming from the mountain tops about and people are beginning to listen, so we feel good about it.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helene.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Jamie.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. I was expecting to be introduced as Jacques or Jaime or something. We're pleased with the fourth quarter guide, Doug. I hope you saw the mea culpa this morning in terms of the PRASM component. Well done, Don, that's for you too, but I still need to ask about margins. The gap to Delta is widening. Look, I know there's seasonality in the business, but the fourth quarter guide looks to be one of the widest gaps ever post-merger, and that's even with the profit-sharing change at Delta and an otherwise unimpressive ex-fuel cost guide from Delta.","So my question is when you decided to revisit the union economics mid-contract, you were pretty insistent or confident that you'd see a return on that investment. I'm not seeing it. And maybe I'm just looking in the wrong place, Doug. Maybe the goodwill that you thought to generate is just, I don't know, taking a longer time to filter through to better passenger service. I don't know, any thoughts on that?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I got a lot. So first off, on the mid-contract adjustment, I'm absolutely positive it was the right thing to do. We told you at that time you're not going to see it. If all you want to do is look at a spreadsheet, you should just raise your costs from what your estimate was. We also told you that if we didn't do it, you should have lowered your revenues in the future because we can't go do all the things I just said we're going to do in the future and ask our team to work for less than their peers at other airlines. We're not going to do that. So yes, we're going to sign contracts and when we sign them, they're going to be at those levels. And no, we don't expect that anytime someone else signs another contract that we need to match it.","But when we get into a situation like we did with our Boston flight attendants, where the contract we had put in place with that same mindset and the same objectives, because of just some unforeseen competitive circumstances, has them in a position where they're going to be well below their peers at other airlines for an extended period of time. We think the right thing to do is to correct that, and you should expect to see us do it in the future if it happens again. I don't expect it will happen again, but if it does, you should expect us to do the same thing because it's the right thing to do for our team.","We can't go make our culture a competitive advantage by asking our team to work for less than their peers do at other airlines. So that was absolutely the right decision and we feel extremely good about it and always will.","As to relative margin performance, I will reiterate again that we at American are focused on running our own game and don't spend a lot of time focusing on what others are doing. We certainly don't define \u2013 aren't going to define our success relative to others. But having said that, I'll entertain the comparison right now because I know it's important to you all.","What I know is this: The trend itself, which I know you know because you can see it in the numbers, is a cost trend, not a revenue trend, and the cost trend is due to what I just said. We had to get our, primarily due to what I said. We had a cost advantage in labor and we didn't think that was right and we don't think it's right, so we had to close it. So that's the trend. That is not a trend I would expect you would see continue going forward, but that's what's driving the trend in relative margins versus Delta.","On the absolute basis, look, margins by region come and go, margins by hub come and go, but what I can tell you right now is Delta has an airline that flies over 40% of their flights in and out of Atlanta, which is a really, really good hub. And if American flew 40% of its flights in and out of Charlotte, we would have a margin advantage there in the business because Charlotte's a really, really good hub. But we don't, so be it.","It's not about mismanagement or anything close to it. It's about the networks that are currently in place at the airlines. but given that advantage, they also have that \u2013 they have that advantage, by the way, in valuation. So look, we look at where we are, we know who we are, we know what we have, and we know there's enormous upside for our shareholders if we go execute against the plan we've laid out. And like I say, we're not going to define ourselves against what others are doing.","The other key point I would make here is, they did their large merger some six, seven years ahead of American and we are closing fast. So a lot of the upsides that Robert talked about and he rightfully said we're playing catch-up, we're not playing catch-up because we were asleep, we're playing catch-up because we did our merger in 2013 and they did theirs in 2007 or 2008.","So all those things will lead, I think, to the trend not being an issue and the absolute number, like I say, sometimes some of us will be in better conditions relative to others given where our networks are at any certain point in time and what region of the country we fly in, what the competitive dynamics are. But the valuations will fluctuate accordingly.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And second, and it's a bit of a modeling question, I think it's where Hunter was going. But flown versus flown capacity looks like it's going to be up at least 3% next year, ex-fuel TRASM up 2%, given where the fuel curve is. You're going to need something like 5% TRASM if you want to hit that $5 billion pre-tax state you're in. You just said that you'd be disappointed if TRASM doesn't exceed CASM, which is good. But I guess the question is whether you'd be disappointed if TRASM isn't more than twice the rise in CASM. I mean, you've got to admit for 2018 to be one of those mid-cycle, $5 billion pre-tax years, we really need to stretch our models at this point. Should we just let go of that target for another year?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Look, the target is, again, one that we have said consistently is one that we believe over time will average. What we say is, good years on average \u2013 that's what we believe, that's how we set our short-term incentive compensation for our executives is if we have an airline that makes $5 billion pre-tax, the incentive payments are 100%. If we don't, they're less than that. And if they're below $3 billion, there's none. We've set that in place because we believe that's what the long-term earnings power of this airline is. And we certainly believe that.","We have not said, and not saying today, that that means every year, you should go expect we're going to be at that number. I'm not saying we're not, either. I'm just making clear that we didn't ever mean to suggest that every single year will be that. What we said is we will be in a range of 3%, 5%, or 7%. So 2016 is not going to be one of those years, that's now clear. 2017, I'm sorry. 16 months. 16 months, that's really clear. So \u2013 as was 2015. 2017 wasn't. I don't know if 2018's going to be or not. But we'll see.","Again, that's something for you all to do your best to try and figure out based on the information we provide and the big missing piece of information that we don't provide is what we think our full-year 2018 RASM's going to be. But you can make your own guesses as best as we can. But what I can tell you is we feel really good about the industry dynamics. We feel particularly good about American's ability to do even better than the industry based upon all the initiatives that Robert and Don have laid out.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks so much for the time, gentlemen.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thank you for the time. Can you \u2013 I'm going to have two quick ones. Can you talk about the progress on corporate sales?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Sure, okay. This is Don. Yes, we've made good progress, this is now the third quarter in a row where we've seen improved performance in our share and share gap. And in this quarter, we also saw an improvement in average ticket value. And as we put more resources into our sales organization, we've also focused on getting more small to medium-size companies with a corporate deal with American. And this year, we've added 16,000 small to medium corporate accounts since January, that's up an increase in total small to medium corporate accounts of 50%. So we're very pleased with the progress we've made on that front.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Don, I'd just add a couple of other quick points. And one is that the team that we're bringing on, that's something that is in progress, but we'll have over 130 new people out in the field by 2018. New distribution capability, really allowing all of our customers to be able to access all of our products, was launched back in June of 2017, will continue to have a positive impact. And then one of the areas that we hadn't spent a lot of time in terms of focus areas of the group's business is something that we've been getting back into and seeing some good progress there, too. So again, the sales team, under Allison Taylor's leadership, is really doing what we had hoped.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. The second question, maybe for Don. When you're, and I assume it was you along with the team, setting the RASM target for the quarter, as I recall and looking at the data as well, the year last year closed quite well and I think close-in bookings did well, particularly in December and the close-in environment isn't as strong this year. Can you just talk about when you were setting that range, how you thought about that situation?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Again, we've set the range based on where we are, our current held position, as well as all of the initiatives that we have in place that are going to continue into the fourth quarter. As far as kind of the close-in yield situation, we saw kind of our close-in PRASM of the domestic business be off just like 2% in July and August, but rebounded quite strongly in September. We think a lot of that has to do with Basic Economy and Basic Economy appears to be doing exactly what we wanted to do. And we think that's going to help us actually drive near-term yields positive as we go through the fourth quarter.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Thanks. I'm not sure if anybody's already asked this, but can you talk about your revenue outlook by region underlying your healthy 4Q outlook?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","It was covered in my opening comments.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC","My apologies.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","He wasn't on then.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","You got it, Don? Go ahead.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes, I'll cover it. So domestic, we're seeing \u2013 as we look forward, we're seeing, actually, yields up, so we're seeing good yield performance in the domestic business. So we're expecting that to hold up as we go through the fourth quarter. Atlantic, we expect to be pretty similar to what we saw in the third quarter where we see pretty aggressive pricing in the coach cabin related to growth of low-cost carriers, but that's being offset by strength in the premium cabin, and we think Premium Economy is going to really help us as we move forward.","Pacific, we're actually expecting to be better in the fourth quarter. This is tied to lapping some of the capacity increases we had last year with new routes as well as improved share performance we're seeing in specialty channels to Asia and the response to the premium product that we put in the marketplace. We didn't have full lie-flat product in the Pacific until February of this year. And we're seeing very good response to the quality of our premium product.","And the Latin is the one market where there's been kind of the greatest amount of uncertainty. The impact of the hurricane in the Caribbean, although we're seeing right, it appears so far that that demand is holding up. Some questions around the travel warning to Mexico, which we've seen a bit of softness in Mexico. And we're seeing some capacity creep into Brazil. So probably the greatest uncertainty we see right now is in the Latin entity, but we still expect them to be positive year over year.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC","That's very helpful. Sorry to make you repeat that. And then did you put any numbers to Basic Economy contribution in the third quarter and what you expect in the fourth quarter? Thanks for taking the questions.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Duane.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","We didn't, Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Vernon. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, Doug, I wanted to ask you like a longer-term question about industry dynamics. And I think a lot of investors look at changes in supply and demand and think that's going to be sort of the outright change in yield for the industry and for each carrier. Are you seeing any greater ability the last couple years to manage your yields independent of what might be happening in supply and demand on a route-by-route basis? Obviously, capacity is going to matter, but is it mattering a little bit less? And if you could talk little bit about what might be changing there, that would be great.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure, although at the end there, it sounded like a short-term question on the longer-term issue. Let me do the longer-term issue and I'll let Don talk about whether on the yield, if we're seeing yield be able to manage irrespective of capacity. Anyway, I have my own views, but I'll let Don answer it better.","On the longer-term issue, anyway, I'll give you \u2013 again, we can only \u2013 all we know about is American's capacity plans and where we think we have growth. I do happen to believe that what you're seeing in our industry is, in terms of the capacity increases, is entirely consistent with what we believe is where the industry is headed, which is in the final stages of a maturation process, where you're seeing hub-and-spoke carriers filling out only in their hubs and you see some attempts from ultra-low-cost carriers and other carriers to find markets which they may or may not be able to do, largely point-to-point and they find trouble as they move into hubs.","So that doesn't feel to me like any sort of major trend, but rather a, like I say, kind of a \u2013 the end, really, of getting this industry to where I think we've been going for a long time, which is an intensely competitive business with three large hub-and-spoke airlines that do extremely well, doing what we do, and then some point-to-point carriers that can find markets where they don't, where what they do makes sense. And that, like I say, intensely competitive, but not continually evolving, so at any rate, with that said, Don, on this yields-versus-capacity question?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","I think we have a number of initiatives that are part of our portfolio that have been rolling out that are all designed around increasing yields. So Basic Economy, all right, that increases yields, because while we were matching the fares before, now 50% of the people that were buying these fares before are not going to be paying more than they paid.","So that's the increased yields. Premium Economy, which we're going to roll out in the wide-body is again increasing yields. This is really a leisure product. And we're seeing people buy up from economy into the Premium Economy cabin. That's going to increase yields. We now have the leading product \u2013 business class product among U.S. carriers in the long haul and we're seeing tremendous demand which is allowing us to actually sell up through the fare ladder into the premium cabin. That increases yields.","All the initiatives we have in the sales organization side is getting a better share and we're seeing it today in our high-value channels. All of that increases share or increases our yield premium. And on the RM side, we've made a number of changes both in terms of our infrastructure and to our business process, which is all designed around selling out more effectively, which will increase our yields. And we have a host of initiatives coming in the AAdvantage program later in 2018 and 2019, which are going to attract more high-yield customers which is going to increase yields. So I think we got a big portfolio of initiatives that are all designed around increasing yields.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And, Don, just to add one more and that's just around all the work that we're doing with the ancillary products as well.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Appreciate the color. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, could you help us understand where you see the distribution model evolving over the next couple years? How many customers are buying directly from you today versus the GDS and how do you expect that to change over the next, I don't know, maybe five years or so?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We've launched our own NDC initiative which we did in \u2013 just past summer. This is a long-term initiative, right? This is not going to be a kind of knife edge. Our goal here is to be able to offer more products and services to both our corporations and our travel agency partners, that's through our NDC product, it's not to replace GDS. But it's going to process, it's going to roll out over many, many years.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And do you...","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","We lost you, David.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","David, you cut out.","Operator","It looks like the line cut. I apologize. Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Dan.","Operator","Please go ahead.","Daniel J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Don, with respect to the full launch of Basic Economy across the system, does that mean it's available on 100% of the domestic flights or only where you face the ULCC competition? That's first. And then I'm wondering if you could just help us frame the revenue exposure, is that, say 10% or 3% of the revenue base that's facing some of this intense pricing competition? I'm just trying to get a sense of the base exposure today because the revenue guide is, of course, pretty encouraging.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Sure. Well, when we rolled out Basic Economy, we rolled it out to the entire D48, and so we have it in all markets, broadly across the entire domestic system.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Exposure.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Oh, our exposure to ULCC price. If you take a look at our total revenue pot, so that's all revenue from all sources and look at the amount of revenue that we currently sell at ULCC fare levels, this is before the basic launch, it was about 3%. And so of the 3% that we sold at basic, or sold at ULCC levels, about half of that now is selling up into a main cabin fare. So it's probably about a 1.5% of our total system revenue, all revenue, total revenue, that's \u2013 we're currently selling at ULCC price level.","Daniel J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Very helpful. And then second, Derek, if I can just kind of go back to Hunter's question and help us to get a little smarter about forecasting stock buybacks, how do we think about aircraft financing for orders that remain aircraft orders? Obviously, aircraft CapEx slows down a lot, but there's still a chunk of change going into new aircraft, so 50% financed or bought in cash? Just anything...","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","I think as we look at \u2013 we're all done financing everything in 2017 and we also have financed a few aircraft into 2018, so our aircraft CapEx for 2018 is about $1.2 billion. I would assume that we finance 70% of that, 70% to 75% of that instead of full up. We may do some sale-leasebacks depending on where the market is and do it all, but I think for modeling purposes, I would use 75% to do that.","Daniel J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, Derek.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","And just one other thing I just wanted to correct from Mike's earlier question on capacity, when we talked about 2018 capacity, I had it backwards. I apologize, but departures will be up about 2% where gauge is up about 0.5%. So that's the 2.5% on a flat fleet. I just wanted to correct that from an earlier question.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Derek. Hey. We hate to cut people off that have questions, but we have a hard stop in about 20 minutes and we need to get to the media. We've got a couple of analysts lined up, it looks like. So we're just going to do speed answers on those and get to the media if that's okay.","Operator","All right. And our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Joseph, how are you?","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. So, Derek, if I back out the ancillary revenue that will be put into passenger revenue starting next year with the rev-rec changes, about 90% of other revenue next year will be the loyalty revenue that goes through other. So is there a plan to either rename or break out that line next year? Why would you continue to call it other when that's not really what it will be?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","I think it's 80% is what the number will be when we get done with it. But we have disclosed a fair amount of it. We already have disclosed what the number is in that line, so you will know what that number is where we have it. If we have one line that says that and one that's other, that's the other 20%. We haven't thought about that in the next year, but I think that number that is in that line has already been disclosed and will continue to be disclosed.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, just buried a little in the 10-Q. So, Doug, it would seem like maybe one of the unintended benefits from disclosures is to your labor groups, the stability that the marketing company speaks to, why they're part of a more sustainable organization than in the past. So has that been a consideration as you think about providing more disclosures and transparency? It feels like you guys are trying to find reasons not to disclose and not really looking at some of the benefits. So what do you think there?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Look, we're not trying to find reasons not to disclose, Joseph. We told you in the past, we have confidentiality issues that make it hard. We try to be pretty transparent about it. But nonetheless, we don't have any issues in communicating with our team members as is. There's nothing about our relationship with our team members that makes us think gosh, we wish they understood better how strong this company was. I think they get it. Indeed, they're a big part of why that's the case. So I'm not compelled by that.","But nonetheless, we hear you on disclosure and transparency. Look, the long and the short of this, Joseph, is at the end of the day, that's just yet another revenue channel for us. And it's a place that we collect dollars even though they come through a credit card company because people use them, and we use that to give people seats that we could sell otherwise. And we don't generally disclose profitability by revenue channel. And indeed, it's really, we can talk about the revenues, it's really hard to talk about the profitability because what you're really talking is the opportunity cost of an unsold seat.","So nonetheless, we'll keep working through this with you. I know it's important to you. We certainly agree it's a key part of our business, and our team gets that completely because they're a big part of the business, as is that program. Who's next?","Operator","And our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Darryl.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. So you guys, along with many of your peers, have highlighted some unexpected cost items creeping in your business lately, things like accelerating airport cost inflation, rising CPA costs, healthcare, shortening useful lives. There's been a long list from airline to airline. But if I were to generalize, I can come up with explanations for a lot of these. You've got tighter labor supply, tighter airport capacity, an R&D cycle at Boeing, Airbus, and oil's taken a reasonable bounce. I suppose these are all things that we could highlight as items that also restrain supply growth and afford you and the industry overall some pricing power.","That being said, can you see any stabilizing factors on the horizon? For instance, have higher wage rates yet resulted in an increase in entry-level labor supply? Are growth investments in airports accelerating, anything like that? Overall, I guess what I'm asking is whether these items are, whether or not first of all, you think they're real supply constraints, and then secondly, whether you think any of them are going away.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Go ahead, Robert.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","No, I'll just start with, look, our greatest competitive advantage is our hubs and our gateways. And at the end of the day, the more that we're able to execute our business model and be able to provide connections and serving the broadest market possible, that is something that we think is a sustainable advantage and something that is unique to American and other large network carriers, and it's going to be where we put our time and attention.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And, Darrell, on the trends question, I'd just add again. And I'm not trying to actually reinforce the view that we think there are enormous cost issues here, but certainly, as Derek said, there are some areas like airport. What's happening is the industry has been consistently under-invested in for a really long period of time because we weren't profitable. And airports require profitable airlines in order to go invest. The good news is we have that now and that's what's happening. You're seeing huge capital improvements throughout the industry in airports. But yes, that won't continue. Over time once those investments are made and that's in the cost structure, I don't think you'd see that continue.","As it relates to the labor costs, as we said, we had a lot of catch-up to do. Once everyone is on an equal basis, we certainly are not seeing at our existing and now raised pay rates any sort of issue in terms of attracting and retaining great people. And I imagine that's the case at our competitors. So I wouldn't expect you'd see once everyone gets on a fairly level basis, certainly not the levels you've seen in terms of wage inflation going forward either. So there is a good bit of catch-up that had to happen from what was once a horribly inefficient industry to one that is now investing for the long term in its people and its airports. But once those investments are made, you shouldn't expect to see it continue.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks. All right, we can go to the media.","Operator","All right, and our first question comes from Mary Schlangenstein. Please go ahead.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","That was close. Hey, I wanted to ask you guys, JetBlue said on their call this week that they don't see tourism to Puerto Rico recovering until the end of 2018. I wanted to see if you have the same view there or if you see a \u2013 and they're talking about 100% recovery, if you see that maybe on a shorter timeframe.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Mary, we just don't know.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Anything else, Mary?","Operator","And our next question comes from David Koenig. These go ahead.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Thanks for doing this. I'm sorry if this came up during the analyst session. I didn't catch all of it. But, Doug, what do you make of the NAACP travel advisory? Did they tell you that it was coming, and are you worried it will hurt sales? Will people book away?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, David. So you weren't on at the start, I guess. I did address that already. Anyway, what we think is we think it's a great opportunity. We know that we work very hard to make sure that we have a diverse and open environment and organization that we pride ourselves in those things. We also know we can always get better. So while the initial reaction was certain disappointment because when you look at that and think how can that be true of us, but once you get past that and think, well, this is a fantastic opportunity because we want to get better. We always want to get better. And what we think is business can lead the way in things like this.","It's an important issue for our country and our world and divisiveness seems to be getting worse, not better. It's things that we always, within business, you don't, we can be leaders in this regard, because our employees are a diverse group of people, our customers are a diverse group of people, so we always end up being leaders in areas like this. But we can also be leaders in making it better. So if the NAACP wants to talk to us and wants to help us get better, we're excited about that. So we've already reached out. We're going to work together to get better. And we appreciate their input and we're excited about it.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Any worry about the impact on bookings?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I don't know. We haven't seen anything, but again, that is not the point. The work we're doing has nothing to do as to whether or not \u2013 it's not about whether or not it has a financial impact on our company. We're going to do it because it's the right thing to make our company stronger and that we care about. So this isn't about whether or not people fly us. We got \u2013 people are flying us and that's not the issue. It's about being a stronger company and providing leadership, so we're excited about that.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question comes from Edward Russell. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell - Flightglobal","Hi. Yes. Derek, I wanted ask about the 5 loans and the 11 sale-leasebacks you mentioned in the third quarter. Are those under the certain aircraft financings and the 10-Q that was released this morning?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes, they are.","Edward Russell - Flightglobal","Okay. And in terms of those aircraft, I mean what kind of aircraft were those 16 transactions involving?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","Mostly narrowbody aircraft. I think all of the MAXes were part of those. Some of those were refinancing of Embraer 175's also.","Edward Russell - Flightglobal","Okay. So the MAXes will be arriving through the end of the year?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes.","Edward Russell - Flightglobal","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Biers. Please go ahead.","John Biers - Agence France-Presse","Hi, thanks very much for taking my question, John Biers from Agence France-Presse. I also have a question on the NAACP. One of the examples they pointed to was of a passenger who experienced discriminatory conduct and responded and was removed from the plane. I wondered what is your policy in this kind of example where a passenger is abused by another passenger? Now are you seeing more instances of this kind of conduct on your flights right now?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay, well, first off, we'll separate your question from the issue with the NAACP because I don't want to conflate those two issues. If you're asking just are we seeing an increase of customer issues on aircraft, not to my knowledge. I mean, we have those from time to time, but our team does a really nice job of de-escalating issues and our objective is to make sure we provide a product that makes all of our customers feel welcome and we'll continue to do that.","But we certainly have, we don't see any significant trends one way or another. These are very rare events when they happen, we transport 500,000 people a day at American Airlines. And sometimes we do have issues with customers and that's our responsibility, just as much the other 500,000 people, so we take responsibility for them. But there is no major trend going on in that regard, but that doesn't mean they're not important.","Anybody else?","Operator","It appears we have no more questions at this time.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you all very much for your time. We really appreciate it. Any further questions from analysts, give Dan a call; media can contract Corporate Communications. We appreciate your time.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the conference to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Cravens","Thank you and good morning everyone and welcome to the American Airlines fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. We\u2019ve got a lot of people in the room today, but on the call we\u2019ve got Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer.","Also in the room with us for the Q&A sessions we\u2019ve got Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communication; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Don Casey, our SVP of Revenue Management; and Andrew Nocella, our SVP of Network Planning.","We are going to start the call today with Doug and he will provide an overview of our fourth-quarter and 2016 results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on our ops performance and revenue environment, and then after we hear from those comments we will open the call for analyst Q&A and lastly questions from the media.","Before we begin we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecast of capacity traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at AA.com under the More About American Airlines Investor Relations section. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we are giving you on this call is as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us this morning. At this point I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thank you, Dan. Thank you everyone for being with us. We are happy to report our results. Fourth-quarter pre-tax earnings excluding special charges were $773 million. For the full-year on that same number we produced $5.1 billion of earnings. That\u2019s the second-best year in American Airlines history, second only to 2015. We are particularly pleased with our revenue performance. Our total revenue per ASM was up 1.3% in the fourth-quarter. That is our first year-over-year increase since the fourth-quarter of 2014, and we are the first major airline to be able to report year-over-year improvement.","Now our unit cost increased more than we\u2019d like, Derek will talk more about that. That\u2019s certainly more than we\u2019d like to see on a run rate basis. But that is almost entirely due to increases in our employee expenses. And as Derek will describe that growth should taper off as 2017 unfolds. And we expect additional cost savings in 2018 as we complete our integration. But look, our people deserve these compensation increases and more. They are doing an incredible job of taking care of our customers and managing through this integration.","Our earnings include a $314 million accrual for profit sharing. This will be the first American Airlines profit-sharing payment since 2000. And that\u2019s due to a program that we at American unilaterally implemented for our team in 2016 and that we are very excited about.","The fact is the exceptional performance by our team is being noticed. We are honored to be named Airline of the Year by Air Transport World for 2017. That\u2019s the first time American Airlines has won this award since 1988. We know we have a lot of work to do. Our team is excited about that fact. But we are back in consideration for being amongst the greatest airlines in the world, and that is a validation of all the work our team has done. We expect and intend to remain there. And we do not intend to wait 30 more years to win this award again.","So with that said I will turn it over to Derek to give you more details, and then Robert.","Derek Kerr","Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. We did file our earnings release this morning and in that release we announced our fourth-quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $289 million or $0.56 per diluted share. This compares to our fourth-quarter 2015 GAAP net profit of $3.3 billion or $5 per diluted share which included a $3 billion non-cash tax benefit resulting from the reversal of our Company\u2019s valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. Excluding special charges we reported a net profit of $475 million in the fourth-quarter of 2016, or $0.92 per diluted share versus our fourth-quarter of 2015 net profit of $1.3 billion or $2 per diluted share.","As Doug said, our GAAP fourth-quarter 2016 pre-tax profit was $550 million. And excluding special charges our fourth-quarter pre-tax profit was $773 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 7.9%. For the full-year our GAAP pre-tax income was $4.3 billion and our pre-tax income excluding special items was $5.1 billion. This equates to a 2016 pre-tax margin of 12.6%. As Doug said both the 2016 pre-tax income and margin were the second-best in Company\u2019s history.","On a full-year basis excluding special charges and a non-cash tax provision of $1.6 billion our adjusted fully diluted EPS was $9.10, down only $0.02 from 2015 which reflects a 19.1% reduction in our fully diluted average share count during the year. We are pleased to see improved revenue performance in the fourth-quarter of 2016 as total operating revenues were up 1.7% year-over-year to $9.8 billion. Passenger revenues were $8.3 billion, up 0.5% on a yield improvement of 1.8%. This was the first year-over-year increase in PRASM, yield and TRASM since the fourth-quarter of 2014. And Robert will give more detail on this in his remarks.","Cargo revenues were up 1.3% to $194 million due primarily to improving yields. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, up 10.2% versus the same period last year due primarily to the impact of our new credit card agreements signed with Barclaycard U.S., Citi and MasterCard in July 2016. Total GAAP operating expenses for the fourth-quarter of 2016 were $9 billion, up 5.4% versus the same period last year. Fourth-quarter mainline CASM per ASM was $0.1293, up 5.7% year-over-year.","Excluding special charges and fuel our mainline CASM was $0.1017, up 10.3% year-over-year, primarily driven by the salary and benefit increases provided to our team members which was worth 7 points, the introduction of our profit-sharing plan 1 point, aircraft maintenance timing 1 point and increased depreciation and amortization 1 point resulting from new aircraft and increased capital investment.","Regional operating cost per ASM in the fourth-quarter was $0.196, down 0.9% from the corresponding quarter in 2015. Excluding special charges and fuel regional CASM was $0.157, a decrease of 2.5% due to the continued shift to more efficient regional jets. Consolidated CASM ex-fuel was up 8.5% for the fourth-quarter. We ended the year with approximately $8.8 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.4 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The Company also has $638 million in restricted cash.","During the quarter we completed several financing transactions. These include closing the 2016-3 Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates with total proceeds of $814 million. We repriced our $1 billion spare parts term loan and refinanced our 2013 Citi term loan with a new $1.25 billion facility.","In the fourth-quarter of 2016 the Company returned $606 million to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments totaling $52 million and the repurchase of $554 million of common stock for 12.2 million shares. The $2 billion share repurchase program authorized in April 2016 is now complete. During 2016 we returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing the total to more than $9.6 billion since our capital return program started in May 2014. That number includes $9 billion to repurchase 228.4 million shares at an average share price of $39.41 and \u2013 sorry, $646 million in dividends.","Including shares repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee share distributions and equity awards and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt our share count has dropped by almost a third from 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 507.3 million shares at the end of 2016. On January 25 the Company\u2019s Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by the end of 2018, and the Company also declared a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on February 27 to stockholders of record as of February 13.","With respect to our pension obligations, the Company is committed to being fully funded under the existing airline relief legislation. In order to be fully funded we will make an approximately $300 million contribution in the second quarter of 2017. Upon expiration of the legislation at the end of 2017 we are expected to make contributions of approximately $1.1 billion in 2018 and $850 million in 2019. Taking these planned pension contributions into consideration, our current debt levels, and to protect against the impact of an adverse economic shock, we have increased our minimum target liquidity balance by $500 million to $7 billion, a significantly stronger liquidity position than our competitors.","Turning to 2017, our capacity is planned to be up approximately 1% which is consistent with our prior guidance. Domestic capacity is expected to be flat with 3% fewer departures offsetting a 3% increase in gauge, with international capacity is up 4% primarily due to the completion of the 777-200 retrofit program in the second quarter and a run rate impact of three new Pacific markets that were added in 2016. During the quarter the 1% ASM growth \u2013 or by quarter the 1% ASM growth in 2017 is approximately 2% down in the first quarter, up 1% in the second quarter and up 2% in both the third and fourth-quarter. Also consistent with prior guidance we expect year-over-year CASM, consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items, to be up approximately 4%.","We are continuing to make significant investments to close the revenue and operational gap with our competitors. These incremental investments are focused on our people, our product and our operation. The increase is made up of 2 points in salaries and benefits, 1 point in maintenance and 1 point in depreciation for our aircraft replacement program and increased non-aircraft investments.","Year-over-year unit cost increases are greatest in Q1 as capacity is down by 2% and these salary increases given to our maintenance and fleet service team members are not lapped until the middle of the third quarter. So by quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items is expected to increase by 8% to 10% in the first quarter, 4% to 6% in the second quarter, 1% to 3% in the third quarter and zero to 2% in the fourth-quarter.","As we talked about on the last call we are close to finalizing the majority of the integration work. Therefore, in 2017 we plan to review our cost structure and eliminate redundancies that still exist post-integration. We also expect improved asset utilization and increased productivity as a number of investments in our operations take hold. We will see the effect of these initiatives in 2018 and beyond. We expect higher fuel prices in 2017 to drive an increase in fuel expenses of approximately $1.4 billion over 2016.","Based on the fuel curve as of January 24, 2017 our mainline fuel price forecast for the first quarter of 2017 is $1.66 to $1.71 per gallon. We do expect to pay $1.72 to $1.77 for the full year. Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided along with the revenue guidance that Robert will give we expect the first-quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 3% and 5%.","For 2017 capital expenditures we expect to take delivery of 57 mainline aircraft and 12 regional aircraft, resulting in total gross aircraft CapEx of approximately $4.1 billion. This is the final year of the big capital expenditures for aircraft and it reduces in 2018 and beyond. In addition, we expect to invest $1.5 billion in non-aircraft CapEx for the full year which includes continued integration work and the investments to improve our product and operations.","So in conclusion, we are very pleased with the outstanding results our team produced in 2016 and look forward to another great year in 2017. I\u2019d like to thank our 120,000 team members for all they have done in 2016 to make American the airline of the year.","Thanks again for your time this morning. And I will turn it over to Robert.","Robert Isom","Thanks, Derek. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We took tremendous strides in 2016 integrating our airline. In addition, we enhanced our network, fleet, customer service and operation. Our employees saw changes in the past year as well with the return of profit-sharing, workspace improvement, labor agreements and the rollout of in-depth customer service training programs. Many of these steps weren\u2019t easy and I\u2019d like to thank our more than 100,000 team members for their outstanding work throughout the year. As the integration chapter draws to a close a new chapter of innovation is opening.","Following a challenging operating environment in the summer our frontline team rebounded with the fall schedule and quickly brought our operations back to the same trajectory that we saw earlier in the year. In October and November our baggage handling performance reached record levels for the new American. In addition, our November completion factor reached a record high for the Company. While December brought the typical operational challenges that come with winter weather and the increased holiday flying our operational performance still improved year-over-year across the board.","As we discussed on our last call on October 1, we moved to a single flight operating system which allowed pilots and aircraft from each legacy carrier to be scheduled interchangeably. This transition has already paid dividends over the last three months as evidenced by the operational results. Moving forward, running a single flight operating system will not only improve operational results, but it will provide the opportunity to fine-tune the network to serve each market with the approximate mix of frequency \u2013 with the appropriate mix of frequency and capacity. It will also assist in recovering from irregular ops as the team and the IOC will have access to a full complement of aircraft and pilot resources to help put the operation back on schedule when things go off.","We are very pleased with our revenue performance in the fourth-quarter. Our fourth-quarter passenger revenue per ASM was up two-tenth of a percent and our fourth-quarter total revenue per ASM was up 1.3%, marking the first positive result for any U.S. carrier in a year and a half and the first time for a legacy carrier in almost two years. And this is the second quarter, consecutive quarter where our unit revenue performance was materially better than the rest of the industry and our legacy competitors in particular.","It\u2019s clear that the investments that we are making in our people and our product are gaining traction in the marketplace, and based on published guidance we expect our out-performance to continue in the first quarter, as well. In spite of unfavorable holiday shifts our domestic consolidated PRASM was up three-tenth of a percent. We saw improvement broadly across all hubs with DFW and Los Angeles leading the way. The domestic business benefited from a stable pricing environment and we saw our strongest yield improvements come from flow market. Our corporate share was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter and we did see a bump in volume and yield post-election.","In particular, we saw strength in banking, financials, industrials and in entertainment. Our Latin performance overall was very strong as well with PRASM up 10.2%. Although Brazil led the way, Mexico, Central America and Venezuela were all positive for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis our Brazil PRASM was up 53%. However, it still remains negative on a year over two-year basis. Our Caribbean performance continues to remain under pressure from low-cost carrier capacity additions throughout 2016 which has resulted in a weak pricing environment.","The Atlantic was our worst performing international entity with PRASM down 7.7%. The main drivers of this performance are continued capacity increases specifically from low-cost carriers and negative foreign-exchange impact resulting from the strengthening U.S. dollar. American is highly exposed to the pound with half of our transatlantic capacity in the UK. The weakened pound negatively impacted UK PRASM by about 5 points. Across the Pacific PRASM was down 4.9% on capacity increases of 39% as we grow into the new services from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Canada, Sydney and Auckland.","Looking forward we continue to see positive trends overall in the forward revenue environment and expect positive year-over-year TRASM in each quarter of 2017. Regionally our domestic first-quarter PRASM is expected to continue to improve versus the fourth-quarter as the pricing environment has stabilized and competitive capacity growth has moderated. In Latin America we expect another quarter of strong year-over-year improvement while the Pacific entity is expected to decline at a similar level to the fourth-quarter.","Lastly, the Atlantic region is showing modest signs of improvement due to easing comps from past terror event as well as our capacity reduction. However, it remains challenged as low-priced carriers continue to grow and the British pound remains weak. With that, we expect fourth-quarter total revenue per ASM, not passenger, but total RASM to be up 2.5% to 4.5% year-over-year. As we look beyond the first quarter we are excited about the commercial initiatives that our team has worked so hard on. We recently announced our new Basic Economy product which will begin selling in February. Basic Economy will not only allow us to offer a tailored product to all of our customers, but will help us compete more effectively with the growing number of ultra-low-cost carriers.","In addition, we have begun to roll out our Premium Economy product on our widebody fleet. And when fully implemented we believe that Basic and Premium Economy combined are worth more than $1 billion in incremental revenue. In conclusion, we took great strides in 2016 to position American as the next industry leader. Our res systems and loyalty programs have been combined, our workgroups have come together and our systems have been merged to create a strong and capable airline that is now delivering positive unit revenue growth.","While we have a lot of work to do we look forward to reporting on future successes. And with that I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A session.","Doug Parker","Excellent. Thank you, Derek, thank you Robert. Yes, operator, we are ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time.","Doug Parker","Hey, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani","Just first question for you, can you just walk through the approach that you are taking with Basic Economy. Just color on how you\u2019re thinking about domestic versus international, the market, the rollout timeline and so on. And then just specific benefits you are looking for in 2017 on Basic Economy?","Robert Isom","Well, Don Casey can help me out, but the idea behind Basic Economy and Premium Economy is segmentation and getting a product and a price to customers at every stage of the demand curve. And so the game plan right now is that we are going to be really smart in terms of how we roll out Basic Economy. We are going to start with 10 different markets and that will start here in the next couple of months. And from there we plan to roll it out and to make sure that we can do it effectively at the airports and to really understand how our customers react, as well.","Our hope is to have it fully rolled out over the course of 2017 and early 2018 throughout our domestic network. Right now that\u2019s where we stand. From a Premium Economy perspective, of course that\u2019s starting with our international fleet and with the 787-900s, and then from there we will be reconfiguring our fleet, our widebody fleet to allow that to be sold throughout the international network. So we do continue to see the demand for the product. And we think that it\u2019s going to really help us with competition from low-cost carriers and defending our hub. Don?","Don Casey","Yes, clearly the product features that we have are not changeable, not upgradable, reduced elite qualifying miles as well as no seat selection in our effective barriers for business customers. This is really all about tapping into the willingness to pay for existing product that\u2019s difficult to get at given the current distribution model which just shows the lowest fare. So those product attributes we think business customers are going to be interested in paying a bit more for our product that we offer today. And as we\u2019ve talked to our appropriate customers since we\u2019ve made the announcement they don\u2019t want us to distribute the basic product to them because they don\u2019t see it as attractive.","But there\u2019s also an opportunity, we believe, to capture an increased willingness to pay for leisure customers, as well, that are buying further out. And for that we think the carry-on bag restriction or the checked bag-only policy related to the product is actually quite critical to tapping into the willingness to pay for leisure customers.","Rajeev Lalwani","And in terms of that $1 billion of benefit that you talked about for Basic and Premium, how much is for Basic?","Doug Parker","This is Doug. I don\u2019t know that we have broken it out. But anyway, know that we believe the value is there, and as Robert just described given the size of the value we want to get there as quickly as we can. We also need to make sure we manage it properly. So as anxious as we are to get it in throughout the system we are not going to go in a way that we can\u2019t manage well and our people can\u2019t manage well.","So I think as you go to model this side I would, again, if it were me I wouldn\u2019t build a whole lot into 2017 because we are going to ramp it up, but and then hopefully we will surprise you on the upside, but know that it\u2019s going to be there in 2018.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then Doug, a question for you. In terms of domestic capacity you are keeping it flat this year obviously. When does that start to reverse itself and what are the metrics you are looking at to figure out whether or not to start pushing it up? It seems like the RASM trends are clearly in your favor, so just how you are thinking about it.","Andrew Nocella","Yes, this is Andrew. It\u2019s flat this year. As we look at the balance of international versus domestic it wouldn\u2019t shock me if we slightly toned down international and add a little bit to domestic this year, but that\u2019s not the current plan. We will just watch the trend. And if those trends continue I tend think you\u2019ll see a little bit more next year given that\u2019s where the RASM growth seems to be given the international environment capacity and demand environment right now.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you, gentlemen.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Doug Parker","Hey, Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just on January, I know you don\u2019t disclose monthly but can you give any sense for trends that you are seeing in South Florida and perhaps the Northeast so far in the month of January?","Doug Parker","Is there something specific you think we should be seeing that you are asking?","Duane Pfennigwerth","Just if there is anything off-trend specifically in South Florida as you rolled up, as you started January relative to the rest of the network.","Andrew Nocella","This is Andrew. I think capacity in South Florida and the Caribbean is really elevated. So it is putting pressure on our Miami hub and I think all South Florida operations. That looks like it\u2019s going to continue for the next few months or quarters at this rate.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. And then on regional capacity I just had a minor detail question. It looks like you are modestly down year-over-year as we roll through the year and you are taking some deliveries. So just wondering is that optimal or was this a function of pilot availability constraints? Can you just talk through the mix shift there?","Andrew Nocella","I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say it was optimal. We are working through our regional jet requirements and making an assessment of where we want to be for 2018. We did as you see from the stats reduced departures and grow ASMs, and we\u2019d like that trend and we did, in fact, plan for that. As we look forward for next year I do think we will stop shrinking the regional capacity at this rate because we don\u2019t want to cut our scheduled depth far more than we already have.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks for taking the questions. Out of respect for the other people on the phone I will keep it there. Thank you.","Doug Parker","Awesome, thanks, Duane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi guys. Thanks for the time. I guess, Derek, I think you said you had some cost reduction initiatives that would help your numbers in 2018 and 2019. Can you give us a sense of what the magnitude of these things might be?","Derek Kerr","We really haven\u2019t gone through that process yet, so as we talked about on the last call there\u2019s opportunities. We just haven\u2019t been through it. When we get through all of the work we are going to do on it in 2017 we will give you some guidance going into 2018. We have given you where we think 2017 is going to be and it comes down throughout the year. But as we\u2019ve talked about on last calls I believe the next two years can be, obviously, no more than 2% and should be we can get it below that.","So we haven\u2019t really gone through it. We are not going to peg a number at this point in time. But we will give you more as the year goes on probably at the end of the year as we go into 2018.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay.","Doug Parker","We understand your desire to know more. We just don\u2019t have much to tell you at this point because we need to go do the work. We, frankly, haven\u2019t spent a lot of time doing that just yet because it\u2019s a ways off because we are still working through the integration. But we wouldn\u2019t mention it if we didn\u2019t think it was a material number, but we don\u2019t have any idea what it is yet. And we wouldn\u2019t want to give you a number and not have it be something we\u2019ve given more thought to it.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then I guess if I can just ask you a little bit more about 2017 and specifically on free cash flow, Derek, you just took everything you knew today with your pension contributions that you laid out and then whatever you think is an appropriate revenue assumption for the year, would you expect to generate free cash flow this year?","Derek Kerr","Well, we haven\u2019t given you the full year on RASM. So I think that would give you an answer of what we think our RASM is going to be for the year. I mean \u2013 no, no. What I was going to say is we have the aircraft CapEx at $4 billion. We\u2019ve talked about continuing to finance aircraft. We believe we will finance somewhere in the 70%, 75% of that range, so if you take that with the debt payments at $2.1 billion and the pension payment at $300 million, you can use that information to get where you are with whatever your RASM number is for the full year.","Darryl Genovesi","And then if I could just squeak one in for Robert or Don, I think you\u2019ve said that your Basic Economy product is going to allow you to compete more effectively with ultra low-cost carriers. But I guess I was wondering once you think Basic Economy is fully ramped up, would you expect to be putting more inventory or less inventory towards matching Spirit and Frontier and those kind of competitors down the road than you do today?","Don Casey","From an inventory perspective, I mean both the main cabin product and the Basic product they share the same inventory. So we are always going to have both products available for our customers. But we will continue to match the ultra low-cost carrier pricing with our Basic product and the Basic product is going to exist on all of the flights that we operate in each market.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Doug Parker","Hi.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. So thanks for the \u2013 I\u2019m going to come at one of Darryl\u2019s questions a little bit of a different way. In terms of the cost savings opportunities, can you maybe give us some context in terms of the overall opportunity as it relates to the outlook for the next couple of years? Which do you think is a greater opportunity for you to close the margin gap or to get your margins where you want them to be, is maybe a better way of putting it, revenues or costs? Which is the greater degree of opportunity?","Doug Parker","It\u2019s not even close. It\u2019s cost \u2013 it\u2019s revenue. So you can do the analysis here, Hunter. If you look at our gap in margin versus Delta it\u2019s more than 100% revenue, so that\u2019s where it is. That\u2019s the good news, by the way, because that is, one, you are starting to see it close now and we have a number of initiatives that we have to put in place that they to their credit already have in place like Basic Economy. And a number of other things that Don and Robert can talk about, but that\u2019s where the upside is without a doubt.","The leverage in this company is in revenue performance to closing the revenue gap, that\u2019s why we are investing so much in the product and that\u2019s why we are investing in the team because we know that\u2019s where the leverage is. It is to close that revenue gap and that is the entirety of the margin gap, indeed it\u2019s more than 100% of it.","Hunter Keay","Okay. So is that regaining lost share or is that growing the wallet share from your existing customers?","Doug Parker","Well, again, I will turn it over to the experts first who can give you more details. But know this. Some of it is just where we fly. If you have a large operation in Latin America right now, while that\u2019s a source of the improvement year-over-year it\u2019s also the lowest margin client in the world right now. So some of it, and you will see this from time to time in each of our airlines as we move forward, there will be certain pockets that we fly to that are producing lower margin and others just because the world economies vary. But that\u2019s not the entirety of it by any means. I just want to point that one out. So you see some of that. But look American Airlines are not too long ago didn\u2019t have a RASM gap to Delta Airlines. We\u2019ve gone through a lot. And they\u2019ve been well ahead of us in terms of getting a merger done and being ahead. So that\u2019s where the upside is, and, again, I will let Robert and Don give you more details.","Derek Kerr","Hunter, I think it\u2019s a combination of both. It\u2019s making sure we get our fair share and growing the pie too. So look, the categories that we\u2019ve got ahead of us and now that so many of the merger constraints and integration are behind us, really exciting to go out and pursue it. As Doug said, many of these things are really things that other carriers have, frankly, had the chance to go pursue. So we are working on schedule and simplifying our design and our rollout for that and potential disruption as we move from schedule to schedule. We think that there is a lot of advantage to that. You know about Basic Economy, you know about Premium Economy. We think that there are things that can be done even further where we are with those categories in terms of rolling out quicker and potentially expanding into other regions.","Long-haul interior improvements, you know we are in the final stages of the conversion of our 777-200 and having lie flat seats for all of our international widebody service. And that\u2019s very exciting and showing a lot of results. There was density that came with that, as well. We think that there is actually additional opportunities in terms of density specifically in our narrowbody fleet that we\u2019d like to consider that, again, would get us back to where others in the industry are.","There\u2019s work that we are doing in our sales organization, as well. I will let Andrew talk a little bit about this, and I want Don to speak to some of the revenue management issues. But, quite frankly, we have not invested in our salesforce really as we\u2019d like and should have, and that\u2019s had an impact over the last few years. And we are going to turn that around. So with that, Don, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about your arm stuff and Andrew maybe a little bit more on sales, too?","Don Casey","Yes, just to touch, basically go back quickly to the segmentation. All the segmentation we are doing, as I mentioned earlier, is it\u2019s just capturing willingness to pay that we are unable to capture without the discounted segmentation model. And that\u2019s really growing the pie. We don\u2019t have to take traffic from anyone else to be able to increase revenues. Just on the revenue management side of things we\u2019ve been on a journey here for the last few years for reinventing how we do yield management and revenue management here at American Airlines.","We already started in the summer of 2015 when we launched \u2013 got a new forecaster, but the new forecaster isn\u2019t really just a black box that suddenly now gives a different number. We completely redid the entire workflow and process within our yield management function. And that was a very, very big change of management process. So we changed the role of the analyst, what they do, how they do it and what they focus on. It did take a while for us to bed that down and get our feet underneath us.","Certainly some of the benefit that we\u2019ve seen over the last six months is just better execution on the YM side of the business as we get better and better at the execution in our new field management process. And we\u2019re really not done with that either. That\u2019s really just the first step down this path. We have implemented an entirely new inventory system in October that gives us a lot more capabilities based on the new inventory system and the structure we\u2019ve created in our forecasting model.","We\u2019ve implemented a new optimizer which, again, optimizes revenue across the network. That was done in November. And at the same time we\u2019ve reorganized the way we use our inventories which gave us more inventories. We are selling the premium cabin in our domestic business. And we have seen quite material benefits of that, as well. But the optimizer, the new inventory system, more inventories for selling premium product, those are benefits that are going to materialize as we look forward.","Hunter Keay","All right, thanks.","Andrew Nocella","On the sales front, Hunter, I think as we look back over the last 12 to 18 months we undersized the salesforce, we have not enough boots on the ground to deal with the potential of corporate contracted revenue that\u2019s out there. That\u2019s, obviously, some of the best revenue in the pool to grab, so we are taking a close look at that. We are going to expand the salesforce. We have worked a lot of process out so we can empower the salesforce to be much more competitive out there.","And we do think as we look at the number of contracts we have relative to our primary competitors we have fewer. We are going to close that gap over the next 12 months. We just brought in a new global senior salesperson, Alison Taylor, who is leading that effort. And it\u2019s going to have a really, I think meaningful impact, over the next 12 to 18 months.","Doug Parker","Look, Hunter, so of all that you just heard I mean everything, most everything Don talked about is not share shift but actually just doing a better job with the existing revenue base. And then what Andrew talked about, obviously, is just getting back to our natural share. It\u2019s not trying to go steal share. We\u2019ve gotten to a point where we have less of that traffic that Andrew talked about that we believe in airline of our size and quality should. So we are going to given all the investment we\u2019ve made we believe it\u2019s natural we should get that share back. Look without, anyway, I will give you my best guess. It\u2019s 80% of the gap closure is going to be doing a better job of just managing our revenues better and 20% of it is getting back some of our natural share.","Hunter Keay","Yes, that\u2019s great. Begs a lot a follow-up questions, but I will leave it there. Thank you so much.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey. Good morning, Doug. I will let somebody else ask you about relative margins for a change. My question has to do with costs. I know that you attribute the bulk of 2017 CASM to labor. I get that. But what am trying to understand is whether all the investments in the business, investments that hopefully allow you to run as efficient an airline as Delta, are these investments currently being made or is that more of a 2018 issue?","The reason I ask is that I don\u2019t want to be too optimistic in believing that you could have the best year-on-year cost performance of any airline next year as we anniversary labor. I guess another way of asking is whether you believe you will be running the airline you want to be running by the end of this year or is there still a lot of cost wood to chop in 2018? Let me put it that way.","Doug Parker","Can you say it again? I just want to make sure I got you right.","Jamie Baker","All right. What\u2019s your 2018 ex-fuel CASM forecast? Simple enough, but if you want to confuse that with revenue you can tell me that number.","Doug Parker","Look, I think we\u2019ve tried to answer that. Here is what we believe. And once we get through what we\u2019ve built into our 2018 plan for expenses, we believe, I\u2019m sorry, 2017, thanks Derek, we believe in 2017 what we have built into our 2017 expenses and therefore what you see in what Derek gave you for guidance, we believe we have everything we need to go compete.","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Doug Parker","So and, again, that\u2019s the belief. Other airlines go and make other changes. We may need to adjust accordingly, of course, so caveat as we should. But this isn\u2019t, we feel really good about once we get through 2017 we\u2019ve got the investment in the airline we need to go run it. Look, I\u2019ve got to tell you there\u2019s one other thing going on, though, as you should know which is the reason we have a cost advantage that I talked about is because we still have some of our employees making less than are being paid at other airlines.","That\u2019s something that, again, we have contracts in place and things like that that you need to be thinking of that as you go forward. You should not expect that we are going to try and run our airline as we sign new contracts with a cost advantage versus those airlines because we don\u2019t intend to. Our people are the best there are. So know that. That cost advantage no one should expect to be long-term sustainable.","Jamie Baker","Okay, understood. I appreciate that. And the second question for Bev. Could you just outline with a little bit more granularity, and feel free to geek out if you want to, what are the relevant integration exercises that are yet to take place and what\u2019s the approximate timing and approximate risk of each one, or associated with each one?","Bev Goulet","Well, Jamie, you know me well enough to know that I like to geek out. But I will try to\u2026","Jamie Baker","We\u2019ve known each other a while.","Bev Goulet","Really three major projects left to get done. First of all is getting our flight attendants into a common system. Hard at work on that right now. It\u2019s a complicated matter. We are essentially taking an LUS contract and modifying the LAA system to accommodate it. But a lot of really good work going on right now. You know, we don\u2019t have a firm plan yet, but we are optimistic within the next 12-plus months we ought to see something there. Also putting in a state-of-the-art HR and payroll system, again a lot of work there when you consider that it covers 650,000 people or so. And then finally we don\u2019t have our tech ops organization integrated yet. And that is a long-term process, best case probably another three to four years.","Jamie Baker","Okay, very good. Thanks to both of you. I appreciate it. Good luck.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Jamie.","Jamie Baker","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","We will go next to Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey. Good morning. So I just wanted to ask on the cash returned to shareholder standpoint, I\u2019m guessing we are going to get a slowdown from the last couple of years. But just wanted to maybe understand a little bit better how you think about that regarding share buyback and also dividends. I know from a dividend yield standpoint you are kind of behind some of your competitors. How do you think about those items?","Doug Parker","Okay, we\u2019ve got to be a little careful about what we talk about, obviously, in the future and how we plan to return \u2013 how we plan to redistribute to shareholders, but I will say this. We are happy with the dividend that we are providing shareholders at this point. As we talk to our shareholders, at least those shareholders of American Airlines today they seem more excited about share repurchase activity, the dividend activity. That, of course, could change and we will keep talking to them. So as it relates to the share repurchase, I will let Derek talk about where we are on that activity.","Derek Kerr","I think the third and fourth quarter slowed down versus the first and second quarter as we, the two things that we did is we looked at our minimum cash levels and we\u2019ve raised that from 6.5 to 7. So we have probably less excess cash than we have had since the beginning of the merger. So I would expect it to slow down a little bit, but that all depends on timing and where we go with things and what the forecast looks like.","So I would hate to project what we are going to do during the year. We just announced the new $2 billion program, so I won\u2019t project how quick we are going to do that. It all depends on what the outlook looks like moving forward and where we are going to end the year and we adjust it quarterly depending on how everything looks.","Doug Parker","I will just add this. We remain bullish, that\u2019s for sure.","Derek Kerr","Yes.","Doug Parker","We talked at length about the upside we think we have on the revenue side. And we continue to believe the industry in total is being undervalued just because of shareholders who are concerned that this really, the issue really hasn\u2019t changed the way we believe it has. So we are really quite bullish. We think there\u2019s now some \u2013 we think the industry multiples are lower than they should be and within the industry we think American has more upside than anyone else.","So long as we continue to produce earnings that we expect, so long as having used those to continue to invest in the business at the level we think makes sense, which by the way we are investing more capital in this airline than has ever been invested in an airline in the history of commercial aviation and we are proud of that. We are going to be putting out a product that\u2019s so much different than what the customers of American have seen in the past as we move forward.","And we are excited about the that. But, anyway, as we continue to be able to do that to the level we need to and we still continue to have excess cash which we expect we will be returning that to our shareholders as we should, particularly at peak moments.","Savi Syth","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Doug. And if I may follow up with you are coming, gone through most of the integration process here. I think there was talk about maybe having an Analyst Day this year. Just thoughts on that, and then maybe what we should expect from it.","Derek Kerr","Yes, I think we are still working through that. It most likely we will have it later in the back half of the year, probably in the third of fourth quarter. No expectations yet. I mean we have \u2013 we\u2019ll go through where we are at that point in time. But our plan is to have one later in the year and have a Media and Analyst Day at the same time.","Savi Syth","Great, thank you.","Operator","We will next to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Doug Parker","Hey, Dan.","Dan McKenzie","Good morning, thanks guys. Well, leave it to me to kick a dead horse here because you guys gave a really good answer on the margin parity question. I just wonder if I can put a little finer point on it. At least as I look at it there\u2019s about $3 billion in revenue that needs to be made up.","And Doug, I appreciate your commentary. You\u2019ve got some geographic exposure which I put at a $2 billion revenue hit. So at least as we think about today, should we think about this as a three-year catch up, a five-year plan, a four-year plan? And I guess as we look at these categories that you laid out for us this morning, do they really capture that $3 billion deficit, or are there other initiatives that need to yet be rolled out at some point?","Doug Parker","Okay, Dan. Really hard to say how many, particularly when you are talking about the piece that is related to global economies, when they return and where those go. So as I know you appreciate hard for us to \u2013 and by the way, we are not endorsing your split between how much of that is the relative economies versus things we can do. But you can do that work and come up with whatever number you\u2019d like.","But there are certainly some related to that. Of the things that we can control, all the initiatives we\u2019ve talked about, I think, again, you will see a lot of it start to come in 2017 but not be full run rate 2017. Certainly things like Basic Economy. By 2018 you see I don\u2019t know, Don, I don\u2019t want to hang you out there too far. What would you say 2017 versus 2018 \u2013 or the 2018 kind of the run rate on these type of revenue initially?","Don Casey","Well, I mean it \u2013 it really varies by very dramatically by initiative, initiative by initiative. The big ones we have talked about, so Premium Economy or Basic Economy, reality is they\u2019re probably going to be 20% this year and 80% next year just based on the where we are in terms of the rollout plan. Some of the things we are doing in the sales side of the business and we are doing on the revenue management side of the business we are going to get to probably I\u2019d say about 60% to 70% of that probably in 2017, the rest of it coming in 2017.","Doug Parker","So anyway, the short answer is yes, we believe we can close all of it. Clearly the economies may vary and we will see. And we think we can do the majority of that through 2018.","Dan McKenzie","I appreciate the clarification. Thanks. I guess\u2026","Doug Parker","And, again, I probably should be clear, completing it in 2018 then really closing in more 2019.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. Robert, I appreciate the commentary on improved ops. But what are the specific goals as you look ahead, what have been the biggest challenges? And I\u2019m guessing that those might have been tied to the MD-80s and the 767s, and I guess just as you think about the ops, how much of an earnings tailwind do you think a better operation is going to be in 2017 versus what you experienced in 2016?","Robert Isom","Well, if you take a look at the last few years I think we\u2019ve had our hands full with integrating the airline. In many respects we\u2019ve run two if not three separate systems when you think about pilots, flight attendants and the aircraft. The great news is we got our pilots and our aircraft altogether. That allows us to start making sure that we have our hubs set up and resourced appropriately. It takes a lot of complexity out of the system. Big upside for us I think is completion factor. Big upside I think is production of mis-connected customers.","And then when you take a look at the rework that defaults with the off-schedule operation, I can probably talk more about this, we have a lot of investments we\u2019ve been making in the last three years on top of integrating that are going to come to fruition in the next couple of years. So, for instance, in terms of bag mishandling I think there\u2019s a step function improvement that we\u2019re headed towards, not the least of which is just due to general improved operations but also technology that will help us reunite customers with mishandled bags in a much more expedited and hopefully cost-effective fashion.","And so that\u2019s going to be a benefit. I think in irregular operation, which has been really the biggest source of issue and concern with customers, it\u2019s tough to put together two systems as opposed to one when things go off schedule. And the good news on that front is we have tools, technology both to get our aircraft and our crews and, importantly, our customers to give them choice to get back on schedule without having to wait in a line or go straight to reservations. That technology I think is all keyed up to come out this year and in 2018, and it\u2019s going to be, again, a big step function improvement for us and something that other competitors have already done.","Dan McKenzie","Thanks for that clarification. I appreciate it.","Robert Isom","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey. Thank you very much. So Derek, when you guys announced your credit card agreement over the summer, you indicated that the incremental revenue from that was 100% margin. Essentially that the pre-tax income matched the revenue, in other words. So it\u2019s clear that there is no recurring cost allocated against that revenue. If that\u2019s the case, why shouldn\u2019t we think of the $1.5 billion in marketing revenue you guys disclosed in the 2015 10-K as similarly a very, very high-margin revenue, say over 90%?","Doug Parker","Okay. Hey, Joe, it\u2019s Doug. I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s\u2026","Derek Kerr","I think, Joe, what we had said at that point in time, you are right, because all that changed in that transaction was a higher dollar amount for each mile paid. So, in other words, the program was in place, we were getting X for what we were for those miles and that number went up and changed. So that increase was, but the base program is not all incremental and not all single margin, but that increase at that point in time was just a higher paid fee to us per mile.","Doug Parker","[Indiscernible] $1.5 billion number he\u2019s talking about?","Derek Kerr","Well, we announced that it was going to be $200 million in the first year, $250 million in the first year, $500 million in the second year and $800 million in the third year. So that was the three-year combination to get to the $1.5 billion of the increase for the next year.","Joseph DeNardi","Derek, just do so I\u2019m clear, the $1.5 billion you guys in your 2015 10-K disclosed that marketing revenue from the credit card was $1.5 billion. That\u2019s separate from what you announced over the summer. I guess what I\u2019m asking is\u2026","Doug Parker","Thanks. That\u2019s what I was trying to get at. Okay. So you gave a number for the 2015 K, we\u2019re $1.5 billion. We\u2019ve disclosed that we have indeed signed a new contract and we\u2019ve talked you about the incremental increase. But I think you should add those two numbers and come to a total number, butit\u2019sup to you to decide how to estimate where we are now. So anyway look, as Derek was saying the increase is entirely due to just getting a higher rate per mile for the credit card.","So, of course, that will fall almost entirely to the bottom line. Now the initial $1.5 billion you\u2019re talking about, that number is the number that we were collecting at that point in time and, of course, we have to redeem those miles. So there is some cost to that, costs we don\u2019t disclose. But you can rightfully assume that it\u2019s a nicely profitable business or we wouldn\u2019t do it. So we were happy with what we were collecting before the new agreement and now we have a new agreement where we are collecting more.","So those I think are facts as we can disclose them. But look, on a bigger point I just want to point out, Joe, you know we\u2019ve noticed what you\u2019ve written on this and look, we agree with you. This is the amount of revenues that the airlines, and particularly American, collect on our \u2013 on these marketing agreements, these credit card agreements are different kinds of cash flows than airline cash flows. They are tied to purchases on credit cards not due to airline economy.","So I think you are right to suggest that investors should look, should do their best to look through and understand the level of those cash flows and the certainty of them. To which point you are going to say, well, then why don\u2019t you give us more information? And which we will tell you we are tied to confidentiality. But let us go work on it. Let us figure out what we can do to give you more information. I think it is important to our shareholders. I think it is an area where shareholders have understood more how much of our profits and how much of our revenues are tied to things that aren\u2019t really related to the ups and downs of the airline environment, that they would have even a better appreciation for why we are so bullish on this airline.","And as we do that what you would learn, of course, is that there is none better than the American Airlines AAdvantage program and our relationship with two providers Citi and Barclays. So we agree with you. Just let us do what we can. We have to live within agreements and we can\u2019t violate those, of course. And we won\u2019t, but we also want to do our best to let our shareholders understand the certainty of the cash flows.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, I will leave it there. Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Helane Baker with Cowen and Company.","Doug Parker","Did you say\u2026","Helane Becker","Thanks. Hi guys, it\u2019s Helane Becker. I just have, okay, so first I just have one housekeeping question. I just want to understand RASM improvement, is it sequential, you are talking about the improvement for \u2013 you are talking about positive for the year, but are you also talking about sequential improvement from one quarter, two quarter and so on?","Doug Parker","All the numbers we give are year-over-year numbers.","Derek Kerr","Yes.","Helane Becker","Okay, then fine. Thank you. My other question, Doug, when you think about the Atlantic and the numbers that you provided and you see the capacity growth that\u2019s coming from especially the low-cost carriers, if you don\u2019t grow, or if you shrink too much you cede market share and that puts you, I would think, longer term in a tougher position because your goal is, obviously, to be the best. Not necessarily the largest, but certainly the best and to want business travelers to choose American first. And I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand that the changes that you are talking about making aren\u2019t going to put you in a position where yields just keep declining in that market as these new low-cost competitors come in.","Andrew Nocella","Well, Helane, this is Andrew. I think American\u2019s position across the Atlantic combined with our joint venture partners, particularly British Airways, is really strong. What we did in the first quarter was cull some flying that was incredibly unprofitable, so you see our ASM shrinking just a bit. But that capacity has moved to the third quarter which is a lot more lucrative for us and, obviously, the industry. So we\u2019ve moved capacity where we think it needs to be. We don\u2019t intend to cede our position across the Atlantic to anybody.","And we are working with our JV partners to make sure we have an effective plan going forward to compete. And that is continued segmentation of the product as we talked about for the future. So we feel bullish about that. It\u2019s definitely going to be a really tough competitive environment, particularly I think over the next year, year and a half as we see these capacity inflows. But our position is it\u2019s good, London Heathrow is the best hub in Europe and we feel good about it.","Helane Becker","Okay, great. Thank you. Those were two of my questions. And I will turn the mic over. Thank you.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","We will go next to David Vernon with Bernstein.","Doug Parker","Hi, David.","David Vernon","Hey guys, thanks for making the time. Just a question for you on the cadence of changes in the ASM forecast. Obviously, you are starting off with very good guidance on the TRASM number. If market conditions stay where they are, should we expect a pickup in the rate of ASM growth to be a little bit of a headwind on that number? Or is that not going to be as sensitive as the unit cost number?","Derek Kerr","You mean the pickup on ASMs versus\u2026","David Vernon","Yes, it seems like the ASMs dip and then they accelerate to about 2.4% by the end of the year. I\u2019m just wondering if the unit revenue growth that we should be expecting would be impacted by that changing mix at all? Obviously, I would think it\u2019s impacting the unit cost growth a little bit. As you get more volume you are seeing a lower rate of unit increase.","Doug Parker","We are not giving forward RASM growth. But absolutely, if you see higher growth in ASMs, all else equal you would expect to see the RASM growth decline and the CASM growth decline. That\u2019s correct. So, again, make your own revenue forecast, but certainly capacity growth matters.","David Vernon","Yes, I was just looking to make sure that there wasn\u2019t something I was missing in that if there was anything specific\u2026","Doug Parker","No, you\u2019re not. Okay","David Vernon","And then as you think about the guidance on interest expense, the step-up of $90 million or so, is that anticipating additional leverage or is that just associated with some of the variable-rate debt?","Derek Kerr","There is a little bit of increase in debt just due to the aircraft coming on. So it\u2019s really driven by the year-over-year increase in debt is that because we took some on last year. Project debt to be up somewhere, net debt to be up or total debt to be up somewhere in the $800 million range, so just slightly up in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America.","Doug Parker","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning everyone. Just one question, one for Robert as a follow-up on Basic Economy. It\u2019s clearly an offering that you and your competitors think will be a nice positive. Whenever I hear that I tend to question it a little bit what everybody thinks is going to be good. But I guess what do you see as the biggest risk in the product and maybe Robert what are the key metrics that you will be watching just to judge whether this product is a success or not?","Robert Isom","The risk that I see out there is really execution. So making sure that we have our customers educated on the product and our airports and employees all set to deliver I think is the big risk. But in terms of performance we are going to be watching it on all fronts, certainly from an operations perspective. But revenue performance is what this is designed to address. And so on all levels we will be keeping an eye. Don?","Don Casey","Obviously, the key thing is trying to figure out what the price premium can be for the main cabin product compared to Basic. And that is going to be a function of the competitive environment. And we are just going to have to figure that out as we go. Obviously, where we compete with Southwest but that does not have a bag fee we are going to have to, again, test to see what kind of premium we can get for our main cabin product versus the Basic product.","Andrew Didora","Can you give us a sense for just in terms of that premium what the way you see demand shaping up for the Basic Economy product what you think is a reasonable revenue premium?","Don Casey","Our pricing for the product is going to be in the marketplace in the middle of February. And so until we get the pricing in the market I don\u2019t think we really can talk about what kind of premium we are going to see.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Hey, good morning everybody. Just two quick ones here for Derek. Derek, when we think about CapEx and debt I guess this is the year of the peak, 2017?","Derek Kerr","Right.","Michael Linenberg","Is that? Okay. Then just with respect to the pension, it looks like that you are either pulling some of the contributions forward? Or was there an accounting change there that\u2019s driving you to the higher numbers?","Derek Kerr","No, we just pulled it forward into 2017 just to make sure that we are fully funded from an airline relief act. That\u2019s the only thing that we did. We used to have $1.4 billion in 2017, we just pulled $300 million of it forward in 2017 and left the $1.1 billion in 2018. So that\u2019s the only change to the pension payment.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. And then just on the pension, what was the liability at year-end and then those numbers that you threw out there for 2017 and 2018, presumably that\u2019s still using a lower discount rate, right?","Derek Kerr","2017 is. 2018 is not, because that\u2019s when the relief act goes away. The liability, our total liability was $17 billion and our assets are about $10 billion.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, so let\u2019s call it\u2026","Derek Kerr","At the end of the year.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, very good.","Derek Kerr","That\u2019s from a GAAP perspective.","Michael Linenberg","Absolutely. Okay, great. Thank you.","Derek Kerr","Thanks.","Operator","We would like to now take our questions from media. [Operator Instructions] Our first question come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Doug Parker","Hi, Mary.","Mary Schlangenstein","Hi, that was close. I had two quick questions, please. The first is when Beth was talking about the FOS for flight attendants and she mentioned a 12-month time frame. Is that 12 months to have everything in place and done, or is that 12 months to get your plan and then have to put it in place?","Bev Goulet","Yes, Mary, I think I said 12-months plus. We are still working out the details of the plan and, obviously, the most important thing is to get it right. It\u2019s complex, there\u2019s a lot of change. We want to make sure we have our employees fully trained and ready to go. So we will be back to you a little bit later in terms of a firm plan.","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay. Are there any numbers or figures on how much you are not getting, how much of a benefit you are not getting by continuing to run two systems or I guess how much an extra cost that is?","Robert Isom","It\u2019s hard to quantify it. But I will tell you what, the vast majority of the integration benefit is really with the aircraft being able to be moved around. So there is inefficiency in the system. But it\u2019s something that really at the end of the day is more an issue that we want to get, we want to take care of for our employees, that they are able to be based where they want to in an unrestricted fashion so they have the benefit of moving around, as well. So we are trying to get it as quickly as possible but I can tell you the biggest benefit I think will be for our employees. Maya you want to\u2026","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay.","Maya Leibman","Just to add to what Bev said, to your question, Mary, we will have a plan with a firm date no later than the end of this quarter.","Doug Parker","That was Maya Leibman.","Mary Schlangenstein","Right, right. Okay, great. So you would hope to have FOS in place or have the two flight attendants all integrated by the end of 12 months after that or the end of this year?","Doug Parker","It\u2019s the best \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 at the end of this quarter we will have a better idea of exactly.","Mary Schlangenstein","Media Of plan. Okay. Then quickly my second question was you\u2019ve talked a couple of times about redundancies. And I know you staffed up to take part, to take care of some parts of the integration, especially the IT issues to make sure everything went well. When you are looking at redundancies is there a possibility of us seeing some job cuts at American?","Doug Parker","Right","Robert Isom","Look, when we talk about redundancies we\u2019ve hired a lot of folks here over the last few years. I think some order of magnitude almost 20,000 employees when you take into account attrition that has happened, as well. My view is that as we take a look going forward we are going to continue to have attrition within the Company. And the real benefit comes in not having to hire at such a fast pace than in the past. So the redundancies, and you take a look at how the airline is working, I really do think that it\u2019s something that we take care of over time and are able to do in a really cooperative way with all of our employees.","Doug Parker","This is Doug now. So thanks for asking, Mary, because we worry. It\u2019s important that we let our shareholders know where we think our cost structure may be headed, but we care a lot more about how our team knows they are going to be treated going forward. So we get really nervous when we start talking about redundancies, and that\u2019s why we are being very careful about what we see in the future. The last thing we want our team to think is that we have some large reduction in force coming because we are not going to do that. We are here because of our team. And to the extent we have the ability to manage the airlines, we get to one airline with fewer people, we will make sure we do that in a way that is cognizant and respectful of the people that have gotten it to here. So we will manage that through attrition and we will manage it through, perhaps, early outs. We will do all sorts of things to make sure we do it right. By no means are we going to do something that doesn\u2019t fully respect all of those that got us to this point.","Operator","We will go next to Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal.","Susan Carey","Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to check on the RASM outlook. I think Robert said 1 Q RASM will be up 2.5% to 4.5%, and you will have positive year-over-year RASM every quarter of 2017. Is that correct?","Robert Isom","That\u2019s what we said, yes.","Susan Carey","Okay, good. Secondly, do you guys want to say anything or \u2013 secondly, what kind of comment do you have about what Alan Joyce said overnight about you resubmitting your API with Qantas to the DOT?","Andrew Nocella","This is Andrew. We are excited to get this resolved with the DOT. We think there is a lot of consumer benefits and we are anxious to make our case and get a fair review going forward. So we will get that going in the near future.","Susan Carey","Well, Mr. Joyce did not say he\u2019s going to do it. He said you may do it, and he\u2019s going to think about it and later tell us what you are going to do. Am I misunderstanding that you actually are going forward with this?","Andrew Nocella","I think we intend to refile.","Susan Carey","Okay. Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Susan.","Operator","We will go next to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Doug Parker","Hi, Andrea.","Andrea Ahles","Hello, good morning. Sort of continuing on with what Susan was asking with the Qantas deal, are there other initiatives or things that you are thinking about either refiling or talking with the Trump administration now that we have a new Presidential administration in office, different policy ideas you think that you are advocating for that you think that the administration might be more receptive to than the previous one?","Doug Parker","Sure. Well, as Andrew said we are hopeful that the Trump administration will give the Qantas JV application a second and more favorable look. We also have an industry effort underway, United and Delta and American together are advocating that the United States government take another look at the Open Skies agreement with the Gulf countries. It\u2019s pretty well-known. A hallmark of the Trump campaign and certainly something that we\u2019ve heard a lot about in the first few days of the administration is the President\u2019s focus on making the world economy one in which American companies can compete better and we think our Gulf carriers campaign is very much that. So we are looking forward to having the opportunity to speak with the new administration, the new State Department, the new DOT about that campaign as well.","Andrea Ahles","Have you had any discussions yet with the new administration?","Doug Parker","Well, no, because the new administration, while the President is in place and very energetically starting to his administration, the rest of the agencies that are important to us haven\u2019t been stood up yet and secretaries haven\u2019t been confirmed.","Andrea Ahles","All right. Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Koenig with the Associated Press.","Doug Parker","Hi, David.","David Koenig","Well, my question was really asked and answered but let me use of the floor. This is for Robert, and I wanted to follow up on one of the analysts who asked about your upcoming op challenges. So, Robert, could you please take another run at that answer? What specific investments are going to improve on time, are going to improve bag handling? How would you summarize that or explain that in terms that ordinary passengers and even a dumb reporter can understand?","Robert Isom","Sure. So in terms of on-time performance, on-time performance is generally a function of your schedule that you produce and maintenance reliability and then how well you execute day in and day out. The investment that we\u2019ve made in bolstering our maintenance capabilities in our hub is significant with both manpower and systems and parts which is going to pay off. In terms of better decision- making, you are aware of the Integrated Operations Center that we\u2019ve built which is state-of-the-art. I think best in the industry, and we are going to be able to take full advantage of that now that we are integrated. So the integration and having aircraft that are fully swappable throughout the system provides backup that we really didn\u2019t have in many places before.","So I do think that we are going to have a material impact in terms of on-time performance and in terms of completion factor and those will reduce cancellation or delays and mis-connected customers. I think there are scheduling opportunities that we can take a look at to make sure that we optimize our schedule for efficiency and making sure that we have redundancies where we need them and that\u2019s a process that we are really finally getting started in earnest, as well. So we will start with a better schedule and we will have more tools out there.","Now when things do go wrong with either mishandled baggage or passengers mis-connected or disrupted because of weather or whatever, we don\u2019t have the tools today. But fortunately we\u2019ve invested in automation that will help us, again, reunite customers with baggage and then also getting customers back on the way. So on those fronts today we don\u2019t have a dynamic re- accommodation tool for our customers where they can go directly to the web or mobile to be able to get on new itinerary. That\u2019s something that we will be incrementally rolling out over the next year and a half.","There are new notification tools for customers in order to let them know what\u2019s going on with their trip and with bags that we will be rolling out over the course of the next 12 months, which is fantastic. And so whether it\u2019s baggage, whether it\u2019s on- time performance, whether it\u2019s the whole overall experience we are going to be doing a better job and, again, I think most of these things are upside for us that some others in the industry already have in position.","David Koenig","Okay. Thanks.","Doug Parker","Thanks. David. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever done this before, but we are running out of time. One of the things we like to do at American, at certainly the new American is same day we announce earnings we go have a big system-wide call with the all of our employees that have been calling in here but what is going on the state of the airline with live downstairs with people that are here, but also for people listening in. And that is due to start in 10 minutes. We need to get downstairs. So apologies if we are cutting anyone off. I think we have time for two more. So operator, two more please.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Alana Wise with Reuters.","Alana Wise","Hi, good morning, thanks so much for taking our questions. I wanted to ask quickly about American\u2019s interest in possibly reworking the joint venture with Qantas now that Trump is in office. They told us yesterday that you currently reviewing the process of refiling the paperwork and that they have been reviewing the implications on how to cooperate on routes. So I\u2019m just curious if this is something that American is currently looking into?","Steve Johnson","Hi, this is Steve. One of the reporters asked that question a couple of minutes ago, and we answered it more fully. But I will just say in the interest of time, yes, we do plan\u2026","Alana Wise","Apologizes.","Steve Johnson","No problem at all. We do plan to refile the application with Qantas. It probably is a few weeks down the road just for the reason that I mentioned before is that the new administration isn\u2019t in place yet, but we are looking forward to doing that and having another opportunity to make our case.","Alana Wise","And as a quick follow-up, I\u2019m curious about Trump yesterday, the administration the other day saying that they are going to implement a border tax and what American thoughts on that are?","Steve Johnson","Well, I never like to talk about politics or religion on earnings call. So I\u2019m going to pass.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Alana Wise","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from Edward Russell with Flightglobal.","Edward Russell","Hi, thank you for taking my question today. What is the status of the JV with LatAm? I know that\u2019s been pending for a while now.","Steve Johnson","We filed that application\u2026","Doug Parker","This is Steve again.","Steve Johnson","Yes, Steve Johnson, again. We filed that application sometime early in 2016. We also filed similar applications in the other countries that are relevant to the JV, most especially Chile and Brazil. The United States application is not going to be acted upon by the DOT until the Congress in Brazil ratifies the Open Skies treaty with the United States. We don\u2019t know when that is going to occur, but you won\u2019t see much action at the DOT until then. And then we\u2019d expect it\u2019s a complicated process and a pretty significant joint venture. So I would expect it would be another nine to 12 months at least after that happens before we have an answer for you.","Edward Russell","Understood. Great, thank you so much.","Doug Parker","Great. Thanks. Thanks everybody. Apologies if we didn\u2019t get to your questions. Obviously, onto corporate communications and they will be happy to get you responses or if it\u2019s investor questions call into Dan Cravens, Investor Relations. Thank you all very, very much for your interest. These are exciting times for us at American. We appreciate your interest in all that we have going on. Talk you soon.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Cravens","Thanks, Ashley and good morning, everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the call with us this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Kirby, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for the question-and-answer session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; and Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer as well as Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs.","As is our normal practice, we are going to start the call today with Doug and he will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from these comments, we will open the call for analysts Q&A and lastly, questions from the media.","Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call also will be archived on the website and the information that we are giving you on the call is as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks, again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thank you, Dan. Thanks everybody for being on. Happy to report our earnings today, $1.6 billion pre-tax earnings, excluding special charges, that\u2019s the second best in our company\u2019s history. It\u2019s worst over the last year, which was the best. Last year, we made $1.9 billion on similar terms. I am not particularly happy about that, but that is revenue driven. Scott will talk more about that and the trends there.","On an EPS basis though, adjusted EPS, adjusted to the fact that we are booking taxes this year and didn\u2019t last year. You will see that our earnings were actually \u2013 EPS, adjusted EPS was actually up 7% even though the pre-tax earnings were down and that\u2019s due to our share repurchase activity, which Derek will talk more about. So, all-in-all, really great results for the team. They are the result of great work by a phenomenal team. We got 100,000 hardworking people in American Airlines. They are out there doing an amazing job of taking care of our customers and we are extremely appreciative.","So with that said, I will turn it over to Derek and then Scott to give you some more details.","Derek Kerr","Alright. Thanks, Doug and good morning everybody. As is our normal process, we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to our 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.41 per diluted share. Excluding special charges, we reported a net profit of $1 billion or $1.77 per diluted share versus the second quarter of 2015 net profit of $1.9 billion or $2.62 per diluted share.","As we talked about on our last two earnings calls, the company did reversed the val allowance on its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As a result, in 2016, the company is recognizing a provision for income tax that is substantially non-cash due to its utilization of NOLs. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly net profit in 2016 will not be comparable to net profit in 2015. Accordingly, we believe pre-tax profit and pre-tax profit excluding net special items is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance than net income.","On that basis, our second quarter net tax or pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion, equating to a pre-tax margin of 14.4% on a GAAP basis. Excluding special charges, our pre-tax profit was $1.6 billion, which resulted in a pre-tax margin of 15.4%. And as Doug said, both of these measures are the second best, second quarter pre-tax margin in company history. Excluding the effect of special items and the non-cash tax provision of $541 million, our second quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.81 per share, up 7.3% as compared to second quarter 2015, reflecting a 20% reduction in our fully diluted average share count.","Total capacity for the second quarter of 2016 was 70.8 billion ASMs, up 1.9% from the second quarter with mainline up 1.2% and regional capacity up 8%. Our second quarter 2016 revenue is impacted by a competitive capacity growth, continued global macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.4 billion, down 4.3% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9 billion, down 4.4% driven by 5.3% yield \u2013 lower yields. Cargo revenues were down 10.4% to $174 million due primarily to a 12.7% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, down 2.1% versus the same period last year.","On July 12, we did announce a new credit card agreement with Barclays card U.S., Citi and MasterCard. This agreement extends and deepens American\u2019s relationship with its existing credit card providers and is expected to generate $200 million in pre-tax income, incremental pre-tax income in the second half of 2016. It\u2019s about $100 million each quarter, $550 million in 2017 and $800 million in 2018 with modest increases in later years of the agreement. Most of the increases will be reflected in other revenue.","Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 3.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to a $530 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the second quarter of 2016, was down 25.5% year-over-year to $1.41 per gallon. Second quarter mainline CASM was 11.32 cents, down 4.6% year-over-year due primarily due to the lower fuel costs. Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was 9.12 cents, up 4% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to contractual labor rate increases for our customer service and res agents, and the introduction of our profit sharing plan. This rate increases were offset in part mainly by maintenance timing and lower selling expenses.","Regional operating cost per ASM in the second quarter was 18.78 cents, down 9.8% from 2015. Excluding special items and fuel, regional CASM has decreased by 4.6%. We ended the second quarter with approximately $9.5 billion in total available liquidity comprised with cash and investment of $7.1 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had $460 million classified as restricted cash. This is a reduction of $51 million since the last quarter. And during the second quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in cash flow from operations and paid $1.9 billion in debt.","During the quarter, the company completed several efficient financing transactions, including the issuance of a new $1 billion 7-year term loan secured by the company\u2019s mainline spare parts and $844 million in JFK special facility bonds. In addition, the company issued $829 million, 2016-2 EETC consisting of AA and A tranches, which was then augmented in early July with an additional $227 million B tranche, resulted in a total deal of $1.06 billion with a blended rate of 3.5%.","In the second quarter, the company returned more than $1.7 billion to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments of $58 million and a repurchase of $1.7 billion of common stock or 50.2 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned approximately $8.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 29% from 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 537.1 million shares on June 30, 2016. At the end of the second quarter, the company had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization.","Our liquidity of $9.5 billion at the end of second quarter was up slightly as compared to $9.4 billion at the end of the first quarter and remains well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimum liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. As we discussed on our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels, higher than our network peers given our overall leverage from the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. In regard to our fleet renewal program, when we merged in 2013, both airlines had widebody fleet replacement plans that overlapped in 2017 and \u201818. As referenced in our earnings release, in order to spread out the widebody replacement orders and our future aircraft CapEx requirements, we announced today that on July 18, we modified our purchase agreement with Airbus for 22 A350 XWB aircraft. Under this amended agreement, we will now receive our first A350 in late 2018. The deliveries are as follows; two in late \u201818 and five each from 2019 to 2022. This change reduces aircraft CapEx and PDPs by approximately $500 million in \u201817 and approximately $700 million in \u201818 and provides us with capacity flexibility.","As we discussed on our last earnings call, in evaluating our leverage we look at metrics such as net debt to EBITDAR as our fleet replacement program begins to normalize and with the deferral of our A350 aircraft deliveries. Going forward, our peak capital spending for aircraft will occur in 2016 and decline going forward. As we see it today, we expect our total net debt to follow the same path, peaking in 2016 and improving each year thereafter.","Turning to our 2016 guidance, we continue to monitor our capacity plans and in our IR update issued two weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by a half point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2%, both from a domestic and international capacity, they will both be up around 2%. So, mainline capacity will be $64.1 billion in the third and $58 billion in the fourth and regional capacity $8.19 billion in the third and $7.9 billion in the fourth. Year-over-year CASM excluding special items and fuel will be up approximately 4% to 6% and regional capacity is expected to be up approximately \u2013 or down excuse me, approximately 3% to 5%. While fuel prices have risen since the beginning of the year, we continue to expect to see significant savings in \u2013 on a year-over-year basis. Based on the forward curves as of yesterday, we expect to pay between $1.39 and $1.44 per gallon in 2016. In the third quarter, we expect $1.45 to $1.50, fourth quarter, $1.48 to $1.53. Regional, we expect third quarter $1.51 to $1.56 and in the fourth quarter, $1.54 to $1.59. Based on these prices, we expect 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year.","Using the midpoints of guidance we just provided along with the revenue guidance that Scott will give, we expect the third quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 12% and 14%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in \u201816 with approximately $803 million occurring in the third quarter and we still expect non-aircraft CapEx to be $1.2 billion for the year.","In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, they again delivered strong quarterly results. While we still have a lot of work to do to fully complete our integration, we are excited about the commercial initiatives our team has implemented as well as those they are working on and look forward to reporting on our continued success on future calls. Thanks again for your time this morning.","And I will turn it over to Scott will to talk about the revenue.","Scott Kirby","Thanks Derek. Let\u2019s start but talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. American\u2019s operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis for the first half of the year, all performance metrics improved for both mainline and regional operations, especially D-zero, which was up 3.3 points for mainline and 10.3 points for regional and our mishandled bag rate which has been reduced by 24%. Of course summer thunderstorms and high load factors bring incremental challenges for our team, but the people of American Airlines are continuing to do a great job taking care of our customers and improving the operation month-in and month-out.","On the revenue front, 2Q PRASM came in at the high end of our forecast. And while it\u2019s still a challenging revenue environment, 2Q is better or less bad than 1Q, so we have at least started to see some second derivative improvement in PRASM. Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 5%. We saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Phoenix, followed by DFW as our second best performing year-over-year hub. Internationally, as we are beginning to overlap the dollar strengthening last year, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges getting smaller and drove a 0.6% decline in PRASM.","The Atlantic was once again our best performing international region despite the high levels of capacity growth, with PRASM down 6%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 15% on 21% ASM growth with continued weakness in both Japan and China, but good PRASM results in Hong Kong and Korea. Latin PRASM was down 10%, but we saw a particular strength in Mexico and Argentina and an improving trend in Brazil. Looking forward, we expect the third quarter to continue showing modest second derivative improvement in year-over-year PRASM. Regionally, we expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. But domestically and in Latin America, we expect continued improvement relative to the second quarter, which will result in low single-digits PRASM declines in both entities.","We see particular strength in Mexico and it appears that capacity cuts are finally starting to catch up to the declining demand in Brazil. Also, we will begin benefiting from the new credit card deals that most of that revenue will show up in other revenue. With that, we expect our total RASM \u2013 not passenger, but total RASM to be down 3.5% to 5.5% year-over-year with about 1 point of that coming from the new credit card deals. And going forward, we plan to continue guiding to total revenue \u2013 to total RASM. While we don\u2019t really have enough bookings or data to have a forecast that\u2019s any more reliable in the analyst community, as we look to 4Q and beyond, we expect to see continued second derivative improvement in the year-over-year total RASM performance and we are looking forward to getting back to growing RASM.","We\u2019re also excited with our plans to introduce basic economy towards the end of this year and premium economy at some point in 2017. We believe that product segmentation is a transformative change in how we segment the product to give all of our customers choice in what they prefer, whether it\u2019s more inclusive product bundle or just the bare bones, low price. Also as Derek mentioned, we also lowered our capacity guidance for the back half of the year, which is really just a normal and natural reaction to a decline in year-over-year PRASM and higher fuel environment.","In conclusion, we still dislike negative RASM, but we feel good about the path that we are on to get back to RASM growth. We continue making gradual improvements in our core results. Our new credit card deal will add significantly to revenues over the next few years and we have some big opportunities ahead of us with product segmentation. When you put it altogether, we feel very good about the foundation that we are building for the long-term, which will enable us to run the world\u2019s best operation and drive higher revenues.","Doug Parker","Thank you, Derek. Thank you, Scott. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mike Linenberg","Yes, hey. Actually I think Derek, you may have called this out just competitive capacity growth is being an issue on the revenue performance, where did you see \u2013 like where was that most egregious, like which markets and maybe it\u2019s more domestic and maybe this is actually more a question for Scott to answer, I know you did call it out, Derek, which of your domestic markets may be have seen the most degree just sort of conditions from a competitive capacity growth perspective? Thanks.","Derek Kerr","Well, look there is lots of capacity growth everywhere, it\u2019s not just domestically, lot of capacity growth across the Atlantic and Pacific in particular, lot of capacity growth actually in the Caribbean and Mexico. The one place, internationally, at least, where we finally started to see capacity start to right-size to \u2013 well, I don\u2019t know right-size the right term, start to at least adjust to the demand environment is South America, where Brazil actual saw declining capacity and we continue to see declining capacity going forward. Domestically, I mean, it\u2019s mostly across the board. We still see higher growth in Dallas out of Love Field. The good news for us is that, that growth as we get to September, we will overlap the last phase of Southwest growth. And so at least the head to head competitive environment for us relative to where it has been will improve in September, but really there has been a lot of growth everywhere. Los Angeles has been a high growth market, but I don\u2019t think other than Dallas, I would single out any particular market for high growth. It\u2019s been across the board.","Mike Linenberg","Right. Just a quick follow-up to Derek, on the NOLs now, I mean, now you are booking taxes, but at what point \u2013 do you have an estimate when you believe you will be paying cash taxes? And I guess I would just presume that just based on current profitability trends, our cash taxes going to become a real thing and maybe what, 2018, 2019, any thoughts on that?","Derek Kerr","Yes, we are thinking right now, 2019 or 2020, but it just depends on also aircraft purchases and other things like that. So, I think we are looking at more \u201819 to \u201820 for cash taxes.","Mike Linenberg","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Doug Parker","Thanks Mike.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks for the time. Scott, just a question for you. We have heard a lot from other airlines as far as pressure is on closing yields and that sort of thing. What are you seeing there, just thoughts going forward? That\u2019s the first one.","Scott Kirby","Okay. So, I guess we are seeing something a little different. You know all of our competitors said it. Closing yields are still down year-over-year, they are still negative, but we certainly haven\u2019t seen another like down. Actually, I would have said probably quite really optically that things look marginally less bad for us on closing yields. But some of that is probably because we do I think have a little bit of a different competitive environment on a year-over-year basis. We have had some huge headwinds from a competitive perspective. Dallas Love Field is one of those big headwinds domestically that drove a lot of capacity growth in our market. And now we are starting to overlap that. And so we have what would be a more normal comparison with the rest of the industry looking forward. And so that probably means that we are seeing something perhaps it\u2019s a little different than our competitors on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, we have had on a year-over-year basis, while we still probably have the most exposure to ultra low-cost carriers of any airline. They aren\u2019t going in our markets anymore at least to a large degree. And so we have less of that incremental pressure and they are adding capacity in other places. And when they do that causes closing yields to decline in those markets. But we have already had that and we are overlapping now on a year-over-year basis, where they are effectively flat in our markets. And then third, we have been less involved in some of the pricing, I don\u2019t think is the right word, pricing issues going on between airlines. We have been involved on the periphery, but some others have been more involved in lowering fares in each others markets than we have and so we have probably benefited from not being quite as involved in that.","Rajeev Lalwani","Right, thanks. Doug, if I could ask you a quick question. As it relates to buybacks, you have obviously been pretty aggressive. Why not be even more aggressive where maybe taking the company private or something like that just given your confidence in the model?","Doug Parker","Well, I think we are being adequately aggressive and properly aggressive. Our view, as we stated many times is after we go through and make sure we are investing in all the right things, our people, the airline, our customers paying off high cost debts, the question then becomes of the cash we continue to generate in excess of that, what should we do with it. And certainly, given our view of the future that we described and where the market has the stock right now, it appears to us that the best use of that cash is to buyback our shares and we are doing so, I think in a reasonably aggressive way, but that\u2019s the current plan.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","Helane Becker","Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for the time here. I just have a question about headcount. Do you think that there are extra people still on board \u2013 I guess that\u2019s a bad way to phrase it relative to the merger and the consolidation? And do you think that as you look out another couple of years that number starts to increase at a slower rate?","Derek Kerr","Yes. Helane, I would say the answer to that is yes. Our number one job is to get through the merger and complete the merger. So, there are areas where we do have extra headcount to make sure that we get the operation running right, to make sure that we complete the integration. So yes, I believe over time, we will pull it back and become more efficient, but I think right now we are doing the right things to make sure that we get everything running right and get the integration done. So, I think over time, it will come down, but over the next few years as we look forward.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then just another process question, I couldn\u2019t find it in the 10-Q real quickly this morning, but the intangibles from the balance sheet declined, did you have to make any adjustments for slots at Newark or anywhere else?","Scott Kirby","Yes, we did, but it wasn\u2019t very big. It was in the $20 million range for us, but it was very small from the Newark perspective. But we did make an adjustment and wrote those down to zero.","Helane Becker","Okay, great. Thank you for your help.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Doug Parker","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter Keay","So I think, Scott, you said in the past that you guys expect to have the best margins in the industry amongst the legacy airline peers and that\u2019s probably looking a little bit less likely now. So if we would sort of like start here and pick one financial-oriented metric that you want American to lead the pack kind of the next 12 months from today, what would it be?","Scott Kirby","Well, look, I still want us to have the highest pre-tax margins amongst the network carriers. I still think we will get there. And I think we are on a good path. We took a step back from, well, a few big things that disproportionately impacted American and these kinds of things are cyclical and they will eventually come back. But you look at Venezuela first, which had RASM that was four times our system average and the country fell apart. And you had Brazil which was 80% something above system average and the country fell apart. Those were massive, massive headwinds that drove 3 to 4 points, just those two issues, 3 to 4 points of system PRASM and 3 to 4 points of margin decline. So, the hell we had to overcome to get back on those things was bigger, because those big macro exogenous events disproportionately impacted American. That said, it feels like we are \u2013 those things are about to be in the rearview mirror. Brazil is no longer a negative. Venezuela is still a big negative. It\u2019s still \u2013 RASM is going to be down 35% this coming quarter again, but it\u2019s coming off a much smaller base. And so now you are something that we call out as a system level impact, because it\u2019s coming off a smaller base. So, we have had some really big headwinds between that Dallas Love Field growth and those headwinds are now in the rearview mirror and we have a more normalized, at least on a year-over-year basis comparison to the rest of the industry. And I think you are starting to already see our \u2013 as we look out our RASM results start to reflect that. We have also been at least one hand tied behind our backs in the last few years as you get through integration and you have all your resources, you have systems locked down that even when you know you want to make changes you can\u2019t, because during the middle of converting the systems and our hands are getting untied now. We still have some of that work left to do but there is more coming. We would have had basic economy and premium economy, which I have said I think I will be disappointed if they are not $1 billion a year. We have those done by now if we hadn\u2019t been in the middle of integration, but we have been in the middle of integration and we have had to get through that. So, I think we are going to continue to knock those kinds of and many other smaller projects out along the way and that we are on a good path we get our credit card deal done. Others get theirs done ahead of time, we get ours done. So I feel really good about the path that we are on and ultimately our goal is to have the highest pre-tax margins amongst the network carriers.","Hunter Keay","Okay. So, you mentioned some of the ULCC competitive headwind shifting, do you feel vindicated, I mean I guess what you said here is, what we have learned is that it pays to kind of go nuclear when this stuff happens, so do you feel vindicated that this is happening now or do you \u2013 now that this is sort of settling down, do you feel like, well, maybe there could have been like a little bit more of a tactical way to do this without setting the house on fire, but we had to destroy the village to save it type thing or is there any like lessons learned that you can extrapolate going forward about how to compete maybe more tactically or do you have no regrets?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t agree with any of the commentary about nuclear, house on fire, any of that...","Hunter Keay","Fine, whatever you want to declare?","Scott Kirby","I think that there was absolutely no choice, but to compete and to match pricing of nonstop competitors, so just absolutely no choice. And it\u2019s not a matter of vindicated or any other of those words. It\u2019s what you have to do. And it\u2019s what we have done and it\u2019s the right strategy.","Hunter Keay","Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thanks Hunter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey everybody.","Doug Parker","Hi Jamie.","Jamie Baker","I am trying to figure out a way to avoid using the term nuclear in my question now, but bazooka versus rifle or something like that. But listen Scott, you have avoided fuel hedging in the past, believing that fuel prices and passenger demand would broadly move in conjunction with one another, if you look at current revenue and GDP trends though, that time held relationship had decoupled for the first time since the financial crisis or the advent of the Internet and by the way, fuel and capacity have been volatile in the past, yet the revenue to GDP relationship was broadly unaffected, so I have two questions, first, what explains the disconnect, is it secular or self-inflicted and two, if the relationship is decoupling and continues to do so, then your primary argument against fuel hedging is no longer valid thoughts?","Scott Kirby","Okay. So I will try on both of those. First, I think there still is a relationship between fuel price and revenues. It comes with the lag. I have historically said four months to six months, one of our competitors said nine months. It does come with a lag. And I think revenues will be higher in the fourth quarter than it otherwise would have been if fuel was lower. Now fuel prices, whatever it was yesterday, $47 a barrel, while it took a very brief spike down to $35 a barrel, I doubt capacity ever adjusted all the way down to $35 a barrel and you saw earnings improve dramatically as a result. So I am not sure what the right comparison is if it was $35 a barrel or $47 a barrel where people were planning capacity from, but I think there still is a link. Second, I think there has been another structural change in the industry. And that has been in particular the growth of ultra low-cost carriers that was a structural change, a structural change that required a structural response. The structural response is twofold. It\u2019s one, to compete with them, which we are doing. And the second one is product segmentation. It has been a structural change in the industry, where 20 years ago we segmented customer demand based on fare rules. And if you are a business traveler, you are \u2013 the higher the fares, the low fares, which were designed for leisure customers, required a Saturday night stay, you had to buy 21 days in advance and that didn\u2019t work for business travelers. That kind of segmentation doesn\u2019t work in today\u2019s world anymore. And so we have to change the model. And changing the model is going to product segmentation, which is what basic economy and premium economy are all about. Now, I wish we could have done that by snapping our fingers like we could make a change in the fare filing and these ultra low-cost carriers grew that we could have immediately affected that change, but we couldn\u2019t. And so we had to compete first and then we will get to segmentation starting with basic economy later this year and premium economy next year. And I think that\u2019s going to address the secular change from ultra low-cost carriers. But we have taken a leg down because of that and I think we will recover once we get those things in effect. As to the fuel hedging question, there is two reasons to not hedge fuel and actually I would have said the tie to revenues is maybe the second one. The biggest reason to not hedged fuel is because it\u2019s of rigged game that\u2019s impossible to be. Fuel prices, most of the time, are trading at contango. So while fuel is $47 a barrel today, if we try to buy fuel for a year from now, its well north of that. In addition, we all realize the risk that you take if you just do countless callers. And so what most people do and the prudent view is that you should buy the options. So if you want to buy an option for a fuel a year from now, Q \u2013 you are going to pay an $8 to $10 option premium. So fuel prices have to go up varies on times depending on how big the contango is and how high volatility is, but in the 30% to 50% range just to breakeven. And when you are playing a game that you have to have oil go up 30% to 50% to breakeven, it\u2019s impossible to win in the long-term. You can be days that you win, but it can be months that you win, but it is impossible to win in the long-term.","Jamie Baker","Okay, I appreciate the input on both parts of the question. I will turn the mic over to somebody else. Take care gentlemen.","Doug Parker","Thanks Jamie.","Jamie Baker","Thanks Doug. Thanks Scott.","Operator","Next, we will take Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Hey. Good morning. Thanks guys.","Doug Parker","Hi Dan.","Dan McKenzie","Hey Scott, British Airways, they cut their earnings outlook following the Brexit vote and I am wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what Brexit might or might not mean for American as we look ahead. And then separately, I am wondering what you can share about BA\u2019s willingness to work with you to optimize the transatlantic flying as we look ahead?","Scott Kirby","So first on Brexit, I think in the near-term and I will define near-term as being until the UK actually leaves the EU. So 2-plus years, depending on when they trigger Article 50. There is sort of I think of it as three effects. One is the currency effect, which is a pretty clear negative. Actually we look that currency by currency, what has the biggest year-over-year impact, it\u2019s been the Brazilian real for a long time, it\u2019s now the UK pound because of the decline in currencies. And by the way, we generated about 4% of our revenues are sold in British pound. So currency decline is negative. The second point is that it will happen over the near to medium-term, the indirect direct impact, I actually think will be positive. When I say direct impact, I mean the number of people having to fly back and forth across the North Atlantic, particularly business customers as there is a lot more consultants, lawyers, bankers that are likely to be flying back and forth, figuring out what the heck this means and what are we going to do. The third and most concerning thing that will be \u2013 that has the potential to be negative is in the near to medium-term, is if it creates business confidence problems. We have seen historically, that when there is business confidence, one of the first things businesses do is cut travel and entertainment budget. That\u2019s not something that would uniquely affect the UK or the EU, it will be a more broader impact. I was gratified to see that while the market fall for two days after the Brexit vote, it has bounced back and that\u2019s usually a pretty good indicator of confidence or highly correlated with confidence. And so I think it\u2019s unlikely that we are going to see a big change of confidence. So all of which means, I think or the next few years at least, there is not going to be much impact from Brexit when you sort of do those three items. Don\u2019t have tons of data, we have a months worth of data so far and our booked revenues have improved in the month since Brexit happened, at least relative to where they were before. So hard to see any evidence that it\u2019s a big problem. Longer term, the issue is going to be obviously what happens with the UK economy, what happens with the banking industry in particular because that is a big component of revenue across the transatlantic and what happens from a regulatory framework. But near-term, I don\u2019t anticipate an awful lot of issues.","Dan McKenzie","Comprehensive answer. Thanks. Derek...","Doug Parker","Thanks Dan.","Dan McKenzie","The board asked also. Well, I appreciate it. Derek, the reduced CapEx and cash tax perspective addresses key investor concerns that I have been getting, just given the net debt coming down, does that also mean gross adjusted debt will start coming down in 2017. And then as you think about the longer term leverage targets say, 3 years out, what could that look like?","Derek Kerr","Well, I think that if we look at CapEx, we talked about it being at $4.4 billion this year, goes down to $4 billion next year and then down to $2.1 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion. So the significant reduction in the CapEx will help all those leverage ratios out. So I think those will be benefited as well going out throughout the year. So, I think all of our metrics from a leverage basis get better as we go through \u201817, \u201818, \u201819, \u201820 as the aircraft CapEx gets reduced over that time period.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Doug Parker","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks for the time. Scott, I wonder if you could put a finer point on RASM expectations for Europe or the UK specifically. What are you expecting in terms of year-to-year change in RASM to the UK in the September quarter versus say the second quarter?","Scott Kirby","Well, look, Europe is probably the only region in the world that I think is going to get sequentially worse from the second quarter to the third quarter. Specifically, it will be about the same on RASM, domestic and Latin, as I said in my opening comments, going to get better. We do expect Europe to get worse, although it\u2019s really core Europe more than it is the UK. Europe has several almost, I guess, three strikes against it looking forward. It\u2019s, one, there is more economic uncertainty. It\u2019s not just from Brexit, there is more economic uncertainty and it\u2019s a challenging economic environment in Europe, so the macro is not good. You got accelerating capacity growth across the Atlantic. So, it\u2019s a second strike for Europe. And third is currency. So, the one impact of Brexit that actually is identifiable negative is currency weakness. So, those three things, I mean, that\u2019s the one region of the world that we think is actually going to sequentially get worse in the third quarter, but it\u2019s really not a UK issue, it\u2019s actually more core Europe than it is UK from our perspective.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Appreciate that. You wouldn\u2019t care to put a finer point on it of how much you expect RASM to be down next quarter?","Scott Kirby","Well, I said double-digits in my opening comments and I am not going to put a finer point on it than that.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. And then the comments on Latin are really interesting, maybe you could help us put some context around Brazil. Could you remind us how much your capacity is down 3Q versus 2Q and what the shape of RASM you are expecting? So for example, we have heard some others that maybe long-haul international to Brazil went from like down 35 to down 25, which is sequential improvement, but it\u2019s still pretty weak for you, your capacity cuts are much greater than that, so maybe revenues or maybe RASM is still sort of flattish. Any help you can give us there will be appreciated?","Scott Kirby","Yes, we have cut capacity \u2013 I don\u2019t know 3Q or just 2Q, we started cutting capacity in 2015 and we could see these results clearly deteriorating. We were surprised actually in 2015. I think, every carrier that flies from Brazil to the United States not only increased capacity, but increased capacity by double-digits, except for American Airlines. So, I think we are probably down 35% to 40% from where we were back in \u201814 today. But in the second quarter for the first time, we actually saw industry capacity come down. It\u2019s going to come down even more in the third and fourth quarter. And as a result, Brazil, which was running down kind of 35%, in the second quarter RASM was down 13%, in the third quarter, we expect it to be positive. Now, we are getting a boost in the third quarter from the Olympics. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect the fourth quarter to remain positive. Although our guess is right now that the fourth quarter will remain positive. There has just been an awful lot of capacity come out and you just got to such a low level, I mean, the RASM will still be down. I don\u2019t know the number, 40%, 50% from where it was at the peak even if it turns positive in the third and fourth quarter, but it\u2019s certainly \u2013 it feels like it\u2019s not getting worse anymore. It\u2019s not really on \u2013 it\u2019s coming off a low base. It\u2019s not really on a rapid recovery, but it does feel like it\u2019s not getting worse anymore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you for that. So, maybe RASM positive on capacity down double-digits for you?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t know what our capacity is right now. As I look at it on our overall longer time horizon, over a longer time horizon, we are down probably close to 40%, but I don\u2019t know what it is 3Q versus 2Q.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay, thank you for the detailed answers. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Doug Parker","Thanks.","Operator","Next, we will take Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Doug Parker","Hi, Julie.","Julie Yates","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Derek, one for you on the CapEx decline in 2017 and 2018 starts to free up some free cash flow, what are your priorities, are there additional opportunities to prepay debt, and is this meant to help with the pension funding requirement coming in 2019?","Derek Kerr","Yes, two things. One it will be we are going to use cash to complete the integration and continue to do all the projects that we are \u2013 we have got on the list as Scott talked about, basic economy, premium economy, cash will definitely go to that first. As we look at pension requirements, our first pension requirement payment is in \u201819. We have a small requirement in \u201818, but the biggest requirement is in \u201819. We do have the possibility to do that early on the pensions in \u201818 if we want to get 80% funded in the \u201818 timeframe. So, that\u2019s a possibility to do, but it\u2019s not required to do our requirement is in \u201819 to do that. So, I think the biggest uses are going to be making sure that we have enough CapEx. We have $1.2 billion this year in CapEx. We expect that to maintain, if not grow a little bit in \u201817 and \u201818 just due to all the projects and the backup demand that\u2019s there for everybody. So, I think that\u2019s where we will more likely go than any early pension payments, the requirement and the pensions in \u201819.","Julie Yates","Okay, very helpful. And then Scott, one for you, from the last year, we have seen the weakness from competitive actions is really contained. How much do you worry about that when you observe what\u2019s going on in other markets with the other airlines that you mentioned?","Scott Kirby","Well, look, it\u2019s a really competitive environment and it\u2019s still a yield in RASM, negative environment across the board. So, we are impacted by that. I think we get better at competing in that environment. The more experience we get with it, we work \u2013 learn things that work, learn things that we can do better, but the biggest thing we can do really is the structural response. And I know on these calls we typically focused on what\u2019s going to happen in the next quarter or the next three weeks and have a pretty short-term focus on it. But the biggest thing we can do is get the product segmentation right, not just for investors, but for our customers, where we can give customers what they are looking for, whether they want a really cheap barebones low price or whether they want a product that has more amenities and is a higher quality product. And it\u2019s taking us time to get that done, but that\u2019s really the right structural response. So, we feel pretty good about where we are. We think that we are on a continuing trajectory and we expected to have a positive trajectory to get back to positive PRASM that happened this quarter and we expect it happen in the second quarter and expect it in the third quarter. And we think we are going to continue on that trend. So, we wish it was PRASM was positive today. We wish we had a benign competitive environment, but we have what we have and we think we are making good progress.","Derek Kerr","And Julie, this is Derek. Just one follow-up to that question. From a debt \u2013 non-aircraft debt payments, next year, it\u2019s only $100 million for us. Year after that, it\u2019s only $600 million. We do have an unsecured bond in \u201818 and we will \u2013 if there is any opportunities to prepay any high cost debt, which we have done a significant amount of and we will do at any point we can, we will use that cash to prepay any of that. We don\u2019t have any planned in \u201817 and \u201818, but if we find things that we can prepay early, we will use any cash to do that in \u201817 and \u201818.","Julie Yates","Okay, great. And then, Scott\u2026","Doug Parker","It\u2019s only because we have a lot of our employees who listen into these calls and you mentioned that pension, I just want to make sure I explain to everybody kind of what\u2019s going on there. The issue is you may or may not be doing that Julie. I mean, we are fully funded per some airline pension funding rules and more funded in that regard than our competitors on the pensions. We, at American, are required because of the way these \u2013 because of the fact, frankly, the American didn\u2019t file a bankruptcy and Delta Northwest did or Delta United did, we are required to move off that funding plan and two other funding plans sooner than they are. And as Derek said, I think that\u2019s \u201818 or \u201819 for us. So, that will require us to move up to a higher level at that time. We could do it today if we wanted to. This is not a funding issue. It will never be a funding issue. It\u2019s just what\u2019s the right time to pay debt amortizations, and this is \u2013 so we will pay that when \u2013 we will fund at that as we are required to. We are fully funded now higher than our competitors and will be funded at a rate higher than them when we do this. But we don\u2019t think \u2013 none of us think it\u2019s in the best interest of the company to go fund it in advance or to be over-funded on something that doesn\u2019t have a return. So we will keep doing until that we are well aware that it\u2019s not an issue whatsoever and it\u2019s fully manageable, it can be funded now.","Julie Yates","Okay. Thanks Doug. And then just one last one for you Scott, on corporate, it\u2019s been a pretty big topic on some of the other calls and you guys haven\u2019t mentioned it, what \u2013 can you give us an update on what trends you are seeing from a corporate perspective?","Scott Kirby","Well, they continue as they have been. We had corporate demand up and we continue to win share. I think corporate revenue was down 1% for us in the quarter, so obviously it\u2019s outperforming the rest of the system. But I think it\u2019s much like it has been. Corporate demand is strong, but we have a lot of low fares in the markets, so we are getting the deal right now.","Julie Yates","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe I would like to follow-up on Jamie\u2019s question Scott, with regard to some of the secular trends that were perhaps one of the thing you would called out, the growth of low cost carriers, but one of the things that I have been thinking a little bit harder about more recently is that we have also seen a lot of frequency acceleration here over the last few years and I am just wondering if maybe you thought perhaps, the quality of the schedule having deteriorated a bit could have also driven some of the decoupling that we have seen in that historical relationship between airline revenue and GDP and just any thoughts around that?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t think so. I mean one of the things that is a close analog to that probably is every airline has increased density on aircraft. And so we have done it, but all of our competitors have as well. And at least as with regard to RASM, that we typically think of those extra seats is coming in at 50% of system RASM. And so we put another 12 seats on the 737-800s that, that 12 seats is 6% of capacity, it means that all those flights come in, the RASM is 3% lower than it otherwise would have been, they are profit positive. But I think that is \u2013 that is probably a change that has driven lower RASM, at least across the industry, it has a corresponding benefit on the cost side of course, that would drive lower RASM. But we still have high quality schedules for business travelers. And I don\u2019t think business travelers are flying less because maybe you have 14 flights a day in a market instead of 15 flights a day, I don\u2019t think you are really losing any business. But people are resigned to stay home because of that.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then you had also mentioned that you thought the Olympics were going to be a positive, down in Brazil, I remember 2 years ago when we had the World Cup down don\u2019t there, you saw some very close-in revenue deterioration, bookings deterioration, which I think was related to hotel availability, do you think that, that\u2019s likely going to be an issue again this time?","Scott Kirby","Well, usually, the Olympics, World Cups, conventions are a negative for revenues, because business travelers just stay away, because they can\u2019t get hotels and worry about the crowds and some business travel dries up. We have seen that in all other Olympics. We have seen that in the World Cup. In this case, Brazil is so bad that there is no business traffic or close to no business traffic. As of this year, I think there will be a positive just because Brazil has fallen so much before. 2 years ago, I would have thought the Olympics would be a negative and it would have been 2 years ago. But today, because things have fallen so much, they are going to actually be a positive.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. And then if I could squeeze one last one, I just like a point of clarification for Derek. Derek I think you said CapEx was coming down by $500 million in \u201817 and $700 million in \u201918, is that just aircraft CapEx or is that total CapEx and I think you said there was also an offset on the non-aircraft one?","Derek Kerr","That\u2019s just aircraft CapEx. Right now, we are showing $1.2 billion in \u201816 for non-aircraft CapEx. We think it will go up to $1.5 billion in \u201817 and then probably $1.5 billion, I just put $1.5 billion for both \u201817 and \u201818 as we finish off and then will drop off in \u201819 and \u201820. So I am trying to get done with all the basic economy, premium economy, all of the interior work that we are doing and all of the completion of all the merger activity we will have higher non-aircraft CapEx in \u201817 and \u201818, but then get back to that $1.2 billion, $1 billion run rate in \u201819 and \u201820.","Darryl Genovesi","Would you just provide the total gross CapEx as you see it today for those years?","Derek Kerr","Yes. I have 5.6 in \u201816, 5.5 in \u201817, 3.6 in \u201818, 3.6 in \u201819 and 3.2 in \u201820.","Darryl Genovesi","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hi, good morning. Actually if I could first ask a follow-up to Julie\u2019s question on the corporate demand, can you just talk about like what the volume trend has been over the last several quarters and if that\u2019s similar or have you seen maybe a deceleration in that trend?","Scott Kirby","I think they have been similar. Not a real change from the corporate demand environment.","Savi Syth","Alright, great. And then just switching to the kind of the non-fuel cost side, on the pre pre-agreed profit sharing basis, if I look at the full year guide, it seems that there is a lot of pressure here in 2016, I am just wondering what\u2019s driving that and when we might see some of the kind of the benefits from merger or integration related benefits benefiting the cost side and maybe just some early thoughts on what we might see from the headwinds and tailwinds in 2017?","Scott Kirby","Yes. I think what\u2019s driving this year is primarily for a full year effect, it\u2019s salaries and benefits and adding back in the profit sharing. So that of a full year, we have guided right around 5, that\u2019s almost 4.5 of it. The third quarter change from the second quarter is really driven by maintenance timing. I think we had a 1.7% good guy in maintenance in the first quarter, 1% in the second quarter and it\u2019s shifting almost exactly opposite in the third and fourth quarter with about a 1.6 headwind in the third and a 1.4 headwind in the fourth. So it\u2019s really a shift in the maintenance timing. Year-over-year, our maintenance is flat, it\u2019s up 0.1, so it\u2019s virtually flat. But it\u2019s the timing of things moving from this year in the third and fourth quarter more than last year being in the first and second quarter, so that\u2019s really the year-over-year timing. As we look forward, we don\u2019t \u2013 we still have one contract to do that is not in our guidance, that we are still working hard to get our mechanics in our RAMP contract done and we want to get that done as soon as possible. That would be the biggest headwind going into next year from a CASM perspective. Other than that, we believe we should be in the zero to 2% range going forward and we don\u2019t see any major CASM headwinds looking out into \u201817 or \u201818.","Savi Syth","If I may follow-up on that, from a gauge standpoint, what\u2019s the trend is there going to be, kind of maybe it\u2019s a zero to 2% would rely on the gauge improvement?","Derek Kerr","Gauge improvements from an aircraft perspective?","Savi Syth","Exactly?","Derek Kerr","There is still some gauge increase. Some of that is going as we modify the aircraft, so maybe 0.5% of that will be gauge driven.","Savi Syth","Okay. And then just from kind of on the regional side, there is not a lot more left then, from kind of up-gauging there?","Derek Kerr","Correct. There is only from a delivery perspective, we only have about 12 aircraft of gauge coming in \u201817, so there will be some effect from the \u201816. We had 42 aircraft coming in \u201916, so there will be a little bit affect that next year. This year, we had a gauge difference of about, from an ASM perspective, of about 3.3. Next year, it\u2019s probably about half of that, 1.5 points to 2 points on the regional perspective.","Savi Syth","Alright, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will take the question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Derek and Scott, I just want to talk about kind of the capacity reductions you announced, I guess it was last week, one of your peers have said that it\u2019s essentially too expensive for them to pull capacity starting in fourth quarter, so I just want to understand, when you guys ran the numbers on pulling ASMs, was it dilutive to earnings and you were just willing to accept that to try and regain some pricing power or was it not?","Derek Kerr","No, we think it\u2019s the right thing to do. We think its earnings positive in that world. I mean look, in a world where RASM is declining and\/or fuel prices were going up, it just becomes mathematically true that everything across your system gets a little worse. And so the bottom 1% has a higher probability that it\u2019s no longer profitable. It is true that you can\u2019t get 100% of the cost out in the short-term that does drive CASM pressure for us, but we think that, that the capacity changes we made are both revenue and earnings positive beginning in the fourth quarter even though we can\u2019t get 100% of the cost out.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, okay. And then Derek, you have talked in some detail about the CapEx and debt profile over the next couple of years, can you just talk about just on the interest expense line when and at what level that, that number peaks and then starts to come down over the next couple of years?","Derek Kerr","On the interest expense line?","Joseph DeNardi","Yes.","Derek Kerr","Let me see. Let me try to grab that for the 5-year plan. Go ahead and ask another one and I will pull that question and I will pull that answer.","Doug Parker","What else you got, Joe?","Joseph DeNardi","I was going to try and stick to two, so I will let somebody else get on.","Doug Parker","We are still long enough...","Derek Kerr","It should stay pretty stable where we have it right now. So, our interest expense line in \u201816 is forecast to be right about at $1 billion and we forecast it for the next. Depending on what we do, I think, right now, we expect to finance a fair amount of those aircraft, so if we do that, we will reduce that pretty much commensurate with what we bring on. So, our interest expense should stay pretty flat over the next 5 years under that methodology. And we have reduced the cost of the debt from 5% down almost to 4% debt, which is as we have refinanced and financed these aircraft at really attractive rates we have reduced our overall cost of debt down to around 4%.","Joseph DeNardi","Great, thank you very much.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Joseph.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here guys. I guess just to go back to the revenue initiatives and cabin segmentation for a moment, I know the plan is to have basic economy by the end of this year. But can you give us a sense for when you would expect those initiatives to really start having some noticeable improvement on the P&L in terms of your RASM or PRASM?","Derek Kerr","So basic economy, I think we will start to have an impact probably on March of next year what I would say. And then premium economy, while we will roll it out at some point in \u201817 because it will also be tied in \u2013 we are going to treat premium economy like a separate cabin essentially. So different than what other airlines might call premium economy today, more expansive, more what it looks like or more how it\u2019s treated internationally or how we are going to treat it internationally as a separate cabin. And because of that, it will have impact on the frequent flyer program and so that will probably be for 2018 really because we need to tell our frequent flyers in advance how it impacts the frequent flyer program.","Jack Atkins","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that then, is there a way to sort of put some brackets around the value you would expect that to generate to your earnings stream over the course of the next, call it 3 to 5 years?","Scott Kirby","I am going to be disappointed if it\u2019s not a $1 billion a year.","Jack Atkins","Okay, thank you very much.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","And now we will begin the media portion of the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Susan Carey","Good morning. Two probably for Scott. I think, Scott, at the outset, I understood you to say that your 3Q guidance is going to be for RASM, down 3.5% to 5.5% and I believe I understood you to say you were abandoning PRASM and you were going to be adopting the RASM model going forward. Am I getting that right?","Scott Kirby","Well, I didn\u2019t say abandon, but yes, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s the better metric to look at more an increasing percentage of our revenues come in the other revenue line. The credit card deal is obviously a big component of that. But also as we move into a world of basic economy and premium economy, there will be a higher amount of revenues that come in other revenues, and that\u2019s really the most important metric. So, we are going to be guiding to RASM on a going forward basis.","Susan Carey","And okay, so \u2013 and the other question I think an analyst asked it, you said there are \u2013 Brexit is not really going to have a big impact on you for the foreseeable future, except on the ForEx front, but I think the guy asked, what are you going to do about coordinating, with VA across the pond in case there has to be some kind of capacity adjustment? Is it premature to talk about that right now or is that something that\u2019s in your planning horizon?","Scott Kirby","Well look, we have a great relationship with IAG and we talk to them all the time about what the right amount of capacity is and will this continue in the normal course in that process and we will react as we see things happen in the market, but there is nothing specific to talk about today.","Susan Carey","Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters.","Jeffrey Dastin","Hi, thank you for taking the question. Perhaps I missed this, but could you specify any markets or if there is particular region that will be impacted by the Airbus deferrals?","Scott Kirby","Well, we didn\u2019t specify and there really isn\u2019t, because we still have to work through the plans on where we are going to fly with the existing fleet. It \u2013 really, what this does is give us flexibility. All these aircraft were scheduled to be replacement aircraft for existing aircraft and so we can extend some of the leases longer to keep the existing flying and\/or growth plans in place or given a weak international environment, we can keep some of those requirements in place as they were and pullback on what our growth plans otherwise would have been. So, it really just gives us flexibility.","Jeffrey Dastin","Great, thank you. And one follow-up question or unrelated question, how are bookings shaping up for cities in Cuba so far?","Scott Kirby","You know, I don\u2019t know.","Jeffrey Dastin","Right, thank you.","Doug Parker","We will get some of that back to you, Jeffrey.","Jeffrey Dastin","Great, thank you.","Doug Parker","Sure.","Operator","Next, we will take Edward Russell with Flightglobal.","Edward Russell","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to understand why you are choosing to do the A350 deferrals now? You have the U.S. Airways and American order books back in 2013, so why the decision to do this now versus a year ago or so?","Scott Kirby","Well, in order to defer, you can\u2019t just unilaterally decide to defer aircraft and call Airbus or Boeing up and say, hey, we are going to defer aircraft and they say, okay. You have to work it out with them. And so we have just needed to find a point in time, where it was in Airbus\u2019 best interest to defer the orders and ours. And so the timing is really about when it works for both sets of partners.","Edward Russell","Okay. I mean, one of the things that comes up I think of is I mean, Airbus has already started cutting metal for first half \u201817 deliveries at this point. So, I mean do you have any color on where you penalized for doing a deferral now or that it was just in the best interest?","Scott Kirby","No, this was something Airbus also wanted and so we were able to work out a win-win for Airbus and American and...","Doug Parker","Yes, hey, Edward, it\u2019s Doug. I mean, look anyway, first off as you know, we came in with two realms of two large fleet orders and we have been trying to get them better coordinated this helps. And on the Airbus front, you should talk to them, but it\u2019s been a very popular product as you know and they sold a lot of them and they are trying to meet all their customers\u2019 needs and this deferral, I think, was consistent with that.","Scott Kirby","We did defer 4 787s last year, so...","Doug Parker","So, it worked out well for us and presumably worked out well for Airbus, but we did not \u2013 we certainly did not pay any penalties for it.","Edward Russell","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","Hi, good morning. There has been some kind of dire forecast out of Europe, European airlines on the impact on travel demand from the terror incidents. Are you guys seeing anything or do you expect to see anything from that?","Scott Kirby","Well, we don\u2019t have anyway of knowing why bookings are lower or why revenue is weaker. Europe is the one area that is going to sequentially get worse in the third quarter than the second quarter. But whether it\u2019s that or whether it\u2019s the economic weakness or whether it\u2019s Brexit or whether it\u2019s just the currency impact or whether it\u2019s all the capacity growth, there is a lot of things that could be driving it and it\u2019s probably all of the above.","Mary Schlangenstein","Yes, thank you.","Operator","And our last question is coming from Ted Reed with The Street. Please go ahead.","Ted Reed","Thank you. Two quick things. First of all, first Delta said they were going to cut to UK by 6%, then United said incremental cuts, and now you are saying no cuts to UK. So what\u2019s the difference is just the traffic doing better than everybody thought?","Scott Kirby","Well, I don\u2019t think we said anything about what we are going to do in the UK.","Ted Reed","What are you going to do in the UK?","Scott Kirby","We haven\u2019t said anything.","Ted Reed","Alright. And the other thing I wondered about is I was surprised \u2013 people were surprised when you put the 787-9 on to go to Madrid instead of to Asia, what was your thinking behind that?","Scott Kirby","Well, we have got a partner in Madrid with a hub there and we just thought it was the right route to come. There is going to be 78s, 9s that will be flying to Asia. We are taking a lot of deliveries and they will be coming, but starting it off, it worked for the aircraft rotation and worked flying into one of our partner\u2019s hubs.","Ted Reed","Alright, thank you.","Doug Parker","Thanks Ted.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Doug Parker","Alright.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead sir.","Daniel Cravens","Thanks Alan and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. In the room with us this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for our Q&A session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.","We're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the fourth quarter and provide some additional information on our 2018 guidance. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment and then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a followup.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website at aa.com.","A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thanks again for joining us.","At this point, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on. Like this 2017 was a great year for American Airlines from a financial perspective as we announced this morning. We made excluding special items $3.8 billion pretax, that's $2.4 billion after tax or $4.88 a share. In terms of accomplishments, the teams did a phenomenal job through sometimes difficult circumstances.","In regard to creating a world-class customer experience we produced record-setting operational reliability to American and we did that where we continued the most aggressive and successful aircraft modernization program in the history of commercial aviation. We've introduced the best lounge product ever created by a U.S. carrier with flagship lounges in Miami, LAX, JFK, and improvements in Chicago. We successfully rolled out our basic and premium economy products. We expanded our network where we have strategic advantage which is in and out of hubs and it's all working.","Our customer survey data on likelihood to recommend is the highest of American Airlines history and our year-over-year growth in revenue was industry leading. As to making culture a competitive advantage we started the year by giving each team member two round-trip positive based tickets in appreciation of their work and allowing American Airlines to win the Air transport World\u2019s 2017 Airline of the Year award. The first time American won that since 1988.","We ensured our team member pay remained competitive through initiatives such as the unilateral mid-contract pay adjustment for our pilots and flight attendants. We invested several $100 million in team member facilities throughout the system as well as equipment improvements. We brought some maintenance work back in-house. We launched the first team member survey in over a decade and now we ended the year by sharing the long-term benefits of the recent tax cuts and jobs acts by issuing $1000 payments to all of our non-officer team members.","All that added up to help ensure some long-term financial strength we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. The totals versus 2014 now is $11.4 billion. We announced up $3.9 billion in revenue and cost initiatives that are expected to be realized by the end of 2021.","And then finally in terms of thinking forward and leaning forward, we forged strategic alliance with China Southern. We strengthened our relationship with our other key global partners and made important advancements in next generation technology and we improved our long term strategic position in critical airports like LAX and Chicago. So we are extremely proud of what our team accomplished and our 120,000 team members that made it happen. We entered 2018 with great momentum and we are bullish about our future.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to Derek, who will give you some more detail on the financials and then we'll go to Robert who has some more color on the revenue and the operations fronts. Derek?","Derek Kerr","Thanks Doug, and good morning everybody. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our team members for the great job they did in 2017 taking care of our customers. Our company continues to take great strides forward and the progress we've made is entirely due to their efforts. We filed our fourth quarter and full-year earnings press release this morning. In that release, our fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net profit was $258 million or $0.54 per diluted share, down $31 million from our fourth quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $289 million.","On a full year basis our GAAP net profit for 2017 was $1.9 billion or $3.90 per diluted share compared to our 2016 GAAP net profit of $2.7 billion. Excluding net special items we reported a net profit of $455 million in the fourth quarter 2017 versus our fourth quarter 2016 net profit excluding special items of $475 million. Our diluted earnings per share excluding net special items were $0.95 per share which was up 3.5% from $0.92 per diluted share that we had in the fourth quarter of 2016.","For the full year our 2017 net income excluding special items was $2.4 billion or $4.88 per diluted share versus 2016 at 43.2 billion or $5.71 per diluted share. On a pretax basis, GAAP fourth quarter 2017 pretax profit was $425 million. Excluding net special items our fourth quarter pretax profit was $739 million resulted in a pretax margin of 7%. For the full year our GAAP pretax profit of $3.1 billion if we exclude special items the number is $3.8 billion and a pretax margin of 9.1%.","For the sixth consecutive quarter our fourth quarter revenue performance led the industry. Total operating revenues were up $8.3% year-over-year to $10.6 billion. Passenger revenues were up 8.1% to $9 billion primarily driven by a 4.4% yield improvement. Our cargo team continues to produce great results. Cargo revenues were up 19.7% to $232 million in the fourth quarter due in part to a 12.2% increase in volume. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 8.1% year-over-year primarily driven by higher bank fees and frequent flyer revenue.","Total GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $9.9 billion up 9.8% versus the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher consolidated fuel expense which was up 23.5%, higher salaries and benefits expenses as a result of the mid-contract base pay increase given to our pilots and flight attendants in April 2017, and higher revenue related expenses and depreciation. As a result consolidated CASM was 14.71 cents up 7.1% year-over-year and our consolidated CASM ex-fuel and special items was 11.25 cents up 3.8% year-over-year due primarily to the expense increases I just mentioned.","We ended the year with approximately $7.6 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $5.1 billion $2.5 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had a restricted cash position of $318 million. Our Treasury team continued to be busy in the fourth quarter completing five aircraft mortgages and two sale\/lease back transactions. In addition, we successfully repriced two term loans bringing our entire term loan performance portfolio to an industry-leading rate of 200 basis points over LIBOR. All of these transactions helped contribute to the long-term financial strength of American.","During the fourth quarter the company made dividend payments of $48 million and repurchased 4.6 million shares at a cost of $227 million. Total capital return to shareholders in 2017 was $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $200 million in dividends and since mid-2014 as Doug said our total is $11.3 billion of capital returned to shareholders. As a result of these repurchases, our share count outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was 475.5 million a reduction of 37% from the merger close in December 2013.","In addition to our earnings release, we also filed our investor update this morning. As discussed at our Investor Day in September we will now provide guidance on a consolidated basis and longer-term CASM CapEx and fleet guidance. We also disclosed in our updated that due to the adoption of new accounting standards on January 1, 2018 relating to revenue recognition as well as the income statement classification of certain pension and benefit costs, we would provide recast numbers for 2017 reflecting those changes.","Under the new revenue standard our 2017 pretax income received a non-cash benefit of $311 million. The reclassification of certain pension and benefit costs resulted in a net $138 million gain moving from operating to non-operating expense and has no effect on the 2017 pretax income. The recast financial statements are included along with the investor update we filed as an 8-K this morning and should be used as a baseline for your models.","We continue to expect our 2018 capacity to be up approximately 2.5% on a schedule over schedule basis which is consistent with guidance provided on our third quarter 2017 earnings call and in line with anticipated GDP growth. The hurricanes that hit Florida and the Caribbean last September which resulted in more than 8000 flight cancellations is expected to add approximately 50 basis points of this guidance on a schedule over actual basis. The full year growth is driven by an increase in utilization of about two points, completion factor increase of about half a point, and engage of about a half a point.","By region we expect 2018 system capacity to be up approximately 3% both domestically and internationally. By quarter we expect first quarter consolidated capacity to be up 666.2 billion ASMs, second quarter to be 73.4 billion ASMs, third quarter 76.76 [ph] billion ASMs and the fourth quarter to be 69.1 billion ASMs. As discussed at our Investor Day and reiterated on our third quarter 2017 earnings call, we continue to anticipate that our unit cost growth rates will trend lower throughout the year and expect 2018 full-year nonfuel CASM to increase by approximately 2% excluding the impact of any new labor.","This guidance includes approximately $250 million of cost reductions from our One Airline initiative which is $50 million higher than what we had outlined at our Investor Day. We expect our first quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items to be up approximately 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis with the increase driven in part by the rate increases given to our pilots and flight attendants last April which is not in our 2017 first quarter base, higher depreciation and amortization, increases in revenue related expenses and increases in rent and landing fees.","For the remainder of the year we expect our CASM growth to trend lower. In the second quarter CASM was up 1.5% to 3.5%, third quarter 0.5% to 2.5% and fourth quarter will be up approximately 0 to 2% versus 2017. Based on the forward curve as of January 22, we are forecasting a 24.1% year-over-year increase in consolidated fuel expense in 2018 or about $1.8 billion year-over-year. We anticipate paying between $2.06 to $2.11 per gallon for the year. By quarter in the first it is $2.07 to $2.12, second quarter $2.07 to $2.12 [ph] also in the second quarter and the third quarter $2.06 to $2.11 and in the fourth quarter $2.03 to $2.08.","Following the passing of the recent tax cuts and job act our book tax rate has been reduced from approximately 38% to approximately 24%. As a result of tax reform the company recorded a special non-cash tax benefit of $7 million to reflect the impact of the lower rate on our deferred tax accounts. In addition, under the new law we expect to receive cash tax refunds of approximately $170 million in both 2019 and 2020 related to the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. While we currently do not pay federal cash income taxes, the new law will substantially reduce the company's tax bill in the future when we do become a cash taxpayer which will be a significant benefit for all of our American stakeholders.","Robert will talk more about our fourth quarter 2018 TRASM forecast increase of $2% to 4% but when we combine the cost guidance we just gave we expect the first quarter 2018 pretax margin excluding special items to be between 2% and 4%. In addition, we also are providing long-term earnings per share guidance at this point. We expect our 2018 earnings per diluted share to be between $5.50 to $6.50 and we will intend to tighten that range as the year progresses.","Our capital plans for 2018 include a decline in spending from previous years due primarily to lower aircraft CapEx. Our fleet renewal program will continue in 2018, but at a much slower rate. For the full year we expect gross CapEx to total $1.8 billion as compared to $4.1 billion in 2017. This includes the delivery of 22 mainline and five regional aircraft. These will replace older Super 80s, Dash 8s and CRJ 200 aircraft.","We also expect to commit $1.8 billion in non-aircraft CapEx to continue the merger integration and complete projects to improve our product and operations such as narrowbody retrofit programs, the ongoing installation of premium economy on our wide-body aircraft and improvement in our clubs and new campus facilities.","With respect to our pensions, on our last call I had estimated that our 2018 pension contribution would be approximately $780 million which will fund our pensions to 80%. However, in 2017 our pension assets had strong investment performance and as a result we now expect to make pension contributions of only $465 million in 2018 to reach that 80% funded level. This amount is significantly more than the minimum required contribution of abruptly $35 million in 2018.","So in conclusion I'd like to once again congratulate our entire team for another excellent year and thank them for getting our customers where they need to go safely and on time.","With that, I will turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Isom","Thanks Derek and good morning everybody. Before I begin my remarks I'd like to echo what both Doug and Derek said and thank our entire team for taking care of our customers throughout the year. They worked through hot temperatures, cold temperatures, rains, snow, ice, hurricanes and even earthquakes and demonstrated to the world what teamwork at American Airlines is all about. So from all of us I'd like to offer sincere thank you for a great year.","In 2017 we worked hard to validate the trust placed in us by our customers, team members, and shareholders. Our efforts were focused on key areas that would help us earn and maintain that trust, such as improve reliability and revenue performance, service to important new markets, customer experience enhancements and improve team member relations.","As we look at our operations, the investments we made in prior years are starting to pay off. We've reduced schedule churn, implemented airport service management tools at key hubs, brought innovated automation tools online and enhanced our maintenance processes. All of these changes are evident in our operating stats as our performance was significantly better in 2017 versus 2016.","In 2017 we posted our best full year results in on-time departures, on-time arrivals and baggage handling since our merger closed in 2013. Our completion factor would have set records too, but was significantly impacted by the back-to-back-to-back hurricanes in September that impacted the Caribbean and Southeast United States. In November we set records in each of the core metrics and equally important, our operational performance during the peak summer and holiday periods were significantly improved versus 2016.","Our full year 2017 revenue performance finished well ahead of 2016 with a 3.9% year-over-year TRASM improvement. Our investments in our product and our team members together with highly effective marketplace execution across all commercial areas set us apart as we outperformed the industry in every quarter during 2017. We continue to innovate in revenue management with our focus on the premium cabin which delivered a full 2 points to system unit revenue improvement.","We attracted nearly 24,000 new small-to-medium sized corporate accounts through revitalized sales efforts and investments and saw improvements in our revenue share premium to fair share in the business agency channel of 2.6 points. The effective launch of our basic economy and premium economy products in 2017 were well accepted by the marketplace and we're looking forward to expanding those products further in 2018 and beyond.","2017 also brought the highly anticipated opening of the flagship lounges in JFK, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, which have been met with enthusiastic reviews. Flagship lounges will be added to DFW, Philadelphia, London Heathrow in the future. We also opened new Admirals Club locations in Orlando, Houston, Los Angeles Terminal 5 and Toronto with refurbished clubs opening in JFK, Chicago and Los Angeles Terminal 4.","In 2017 we also introduced several new customer service tools with dynamic re-accommodation, customer bag notification, Notify All and a refreshed mobile app. All of those tools will help to provide a smooth customer journey, both on the ground in the year. We're also enhancing the customer experience in Main Cabin Extra. As we announced in September, we'll be adding free drinks and easier to use overhead bin space in Main Cabin Extra. The new placards will go on to the overhead bins next week and that free drink is coming in the spring.","On the fleet side, 2017 was the final year of our Accelerative Fleet Renewal Program where we inducted more than 400 mainline and 100 regional aircraft. We added an average of 97 aircraft per year from 20 14 to 2017 and expect to only induct 27 aircraft in 2018. We also made good progress on several projects that will improve profitability and enhance the customer experience.","The 777-200 retrofit program which involved updating the aircraft interiors, adding new IFE and Wi-Fi was completed in mid-2017 Premium Economy officially launched in early May on the 787-9 aircraft and customer response has been very positive. More than half the planned widebody fleet now features this highly differentiated product and all planned aircraft will have it installed by the fourth quarter of this year. The 777-200 fleet, the high density 777-200 fleet and the 330-200s are fully installed and work is underway on the 777-300 fleet as well. In addition, the narrowbody satellite Wi-Fi project that we outlined at the Investor Day in September commenced in the fourth quarter.","And lastly, we completed the mainline livery repainting project in the fourth quarter. So all mainline aircraft that are planned to stay in the fleet have now been painted.","Turning to revenue, the demand environment continues to be strong. Our fourth quarter consolidated PRASM was up 5.4% and our fourth quarter TRASM was up 5.6%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth and the sixth consecutive quarter where we outpaced the industry average growth rate. Improvement was broad-based with every entity in a positive territory for the quarter.","In fact we closed out the year with every entity with positive unit revenue growth for the entire year. We had another quarter of strong performance in the corporate segment and forward outlook remains positive as our sales investments and initiatives continue to take hold. Corporate revenue continued to improve quarter over quarter ending the fourth quarter 2017 with the highest year-over-year growth of the last eight quarters.","In the domestic, our consolidated PRASM was up 5.7%. We were able to deliver both load factor and yield improvements with continually improving revenue management execution in both the trough and peak periods. DFW and Phoenix led the way and improved performance. The improvements were broad-based with every hub exhibiting unit revenue growth. Our Latin America performance was very strong with PRASM up 6.3%, notwithstanding Brazil unit revenue being flat year-over-year. The rest of South America, the Caribbean and Central America, all had double-digit revenue - unit revenue growth.","Atlantic unit revenue was up 7.7%, the best result we've seen since the merger. Improved execution of low-cost carrier price matching together with strong premium cabin performance due to our premium cabin initiatives were the primary drivers and the UK led the way with double digit growth.","Across the Pacific, PRASM was up 1.2% year-over-year in line with performance from previous quarters, while growing capacity by 7.5% with the launch of Los Angeles to Beijing, again our strong premium cabin performance made the material difference.","Fourth quarter cargo revenue improved 19.7% year-over-year on both strong volume and yields, continuing a positive trend that we've seen since the second half of 2016. We expect our year-over-year TRASM to be up 2% to 4% in the first quarter. This will mark the sixth quarter in a row of positive unit revenue growth. Consistent with 2017 we expect all four entities to have positive unit revenue growth led by Latin, followed by Atlantic, then Domestic and Pacific.","As we look to 2018 we continue to be encouraged with the revenue environment and are excited about what that means for American. Over the past few years we've made significant investments in our team, our product, and our operations and those are all paying off. We're proud of what our team has accomplished so far and we look forward to the future and with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, good morning guys. Two questions here, just on the guidance in the non-operating [ph] it looks like you're getting a $300 million benefit there and it does look like I guess Republics in there. Is some of that what just been with the pension I know you've had a pension benefit that ran through the P&L is that showing up in there? What's driving that number?","Derek Kerr","Yes that's all, Michael most of that is the pension benefit. The Republic, since we're 25% ownership we do have to use the equity method of accounting, but that's a small portion. In 2017 it was only $14 million. So, most of this is the pension credit, the 138 coming down to that bottom line. ","Michael Linenberg","Okay and so that you know under the old accounting Derek, that pension piece would have just shown up in salary and wage expense?","Derek Kerr","Correct it would have been a credit to salaries and then wages.","Michael Linenberg","Okay perfect and then second question on, I really appreciate the fact that you guys are providing a fleet plan all the way out to 2020, this is great. I'm curious on two things, it looks like the A330- 300s do they go away and I'm curious if they are going to be offset by other widebodys, it looks like you're widebody fleet actually shrinks in 2020, are we going to see international capacity down? And then the E190s also look like they go away at the end of 2018 am I reading that right?","Derek Kerr","Yes, I think two things to look at. I think you know focus more on '18 and '19 because we know where we are on those two. The plan is to take the Embraer 190 fleet and the MD-80 fleet out by the end of '19 and that's firm in the plan. We are working from a widebody perspective as we talked about on the call as before, you see the A350s coming in in 2020, you know we've had conversations about that. Those would replace - they are currently set to replace aA330-300s and other widebodys as they come in. We have talked about that. We're working with Airbus and Boeing on other options from a widebody perspective just to see where we go with that.","So I think this can change out in the farther years in 2020. I think the fleet plan over the time period should stay pretty flat. Right now we have it going down a little bit in 2020 because this just represents the transactions that we have in place today and that are firm. Nothing other than that.","So I would expect probably from an aircraft standpoint that the 951 we have at 2018 you know probably stays pretty flat in that 940 to 950 range through 2020 and then as we see on the regional aircraft we do stay within the 600, 590 to 600 range. So there will be some tweaks and we'll continue to update you as we move forward on each of these. But I would assume that this fleet stays pretty flat over the next to two to three years.","Michael Linenberg","Okay great, thanks Derek.","Derek Kerr","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kevin Crissey with Citi.","Kevin Crissey","Good morning, thanks for the time. Kind of an off, unusual question I think and maybe it's for Derek or I'm not sure who should answer this. If we think about the return on invested capital of the underlying airline, it's improved significantly, and while cargo has improved, you know, you mentioned that how well cargo was doing on a year-over-year basis, I wanted to get an understanding of how cargo return on invested capital fully allocated compares to that of the airline because it might \u2013 sense is historically is that it hasn't had you know it may be was contributing when the airline was weaker, but it may be not be meeting that standard now, so I wanted to understand how you think about cargoes return relative to the airline? Thanks.","Doug Parker","Hey Kevin, I'll start and then Robert can just give you more color if you'd like on the cargo business of it. Trying to put a return on invested capital on the cargo business, you know which basically assumes that capital is dedicated in the cargo businesses [indiscernible]. We invest in capital through our people and cargo and we invest in their plans and a lot more for people than for cargo. So you need to put them together and it's impossible. It's really difficult and we certainly don\u2019t intend to put our returns on just the cargo business. They come together when you acquire the capital and aircraft.","We certainly don\u2019t think there's enough return in that business for an airline like American to go invest in freighters for example. That's someone else's business, but because we invest, because we do a really nice job of connecting people around the globe, we can indeed fly around our cargo and then again that business is as you noted, as we noted is picking up, anything to add Robert?","Robert Isom","No this is just that, that belly space on those aircraft are going to be flying around no matter what we do and the cool thing about the fleet renewal program is that as we take a look at 767s leaving the fleet and bringing on things like you know 787s, the capacity that comes with that is really helpful.","So we're seeing benefit from that, both in the opportunity to put more cargo on the plains and at the end of the day I'm really confident that the profitability, the marginal profitability of that product is well worth being in the business.","Kevin Crissey","How was it that you determined the appropriate pricing levels then forward if it's seen as like basically free belly space?","Robert Isom","It\u2019s free belly space. Of course there's equipment and people in that and we price it to achieve, you know and we're not going to get into that today, but we price it to achieve what we consider a significant margin and you know a margin that in many cases exceeds what we would see from aspects of our passenger revenue.","We've got a great cargo team led by Rick Elieson, who was appointed earlier this past year taking over from Jim Butler. We're returning to levels of production that we really haven\u2019t seen since 2014. And when you take a look at, you know, what we've actually produced over the last couple of quarters, it\u2019s both volume and yield based, so you know all good.","Kevin Crissey","Thanks for taking the kind of offbeat question.","Robert Isom","No problem, thanks Kevin.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hey thank you guys, Good morning. Doug, I appreciate your leap of faith on the earnings guide, I really do, but then I probably know the answer to this, but was this the same EPS range that you expected to provide a couple of days ago, before United announced their, let's just call it ambitious capacity plan?","Doug Parker","Yes.","Hunter Keay","Okay, thank you. And then just a quick followup, does this include buybacks or no? I would guess it does right?","Doug Parker","It was arranged for a reason as an EPS.","Hunter Keay","Okay, fine and then Robert, in the opening remarks, funny you cited effective LCC price matching is a tailwind to your transatlantic RASM, it's funny. You get \u2013 calling price matching is the reason your RASM was good. Can you, if I am not misinterpreting the comment, can you just elaborate on what you meant by that and maybe feel free to talk about that entire LCC transatlantic dynamic for a second while you're at it? Thank you.","Robert Isom","We'll, I would like to start on that, but go ahead and share, just as there is a price matching and you know the industry ended up much more comprehensively matching the Atlantic LCCs in October 2016, so we're kind of lapping the period where we started the matching and over the kind of the year we've become - as we looked at the results more affective at where we match, and how the yield management system views those fares and when we are open and closed. So this is really a benefit associated to better execution, right of the strategy that when the industry started to employ in October 2016.","Hunter Keay","I see, thank you, Doug.","Doug Parker","Thanks [indiscernible].","Operator","And we would take our next question from Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning. Doug, followup to Hunter\u2019s question, why should we believe the 2018 guide? Why should we believe anything Derek just said about aircraft? Why shouldn\u2019t we expect an incremental aircraft order, in order to offset what United is doing? I'm obviously trying to bait you, but I\u2019d appreciate a detailed response.","Doug Parker","Yes, okay. Yes, I\u2019ll try not to take the bait, but I'll try \u2013 let me try and help. So I know it's important, obviously. You know, American Airlines shareholders got caught up in this yesterday too is as important, you will all have a chance to always understanding somewhat our view. But look you know we're not going to pine on other airlines capacity plans. That's for them to decide what to do to and to describe to you their plans. What I can tell - what we're happy to talk about is Americans growth which may or may not provide some insight into what\u2019s going on in other airlines and again maybe help or maybe not but I can talk about what we're doing.","So you know, Derek told you that we estimate at American that we're going to grow you know schedule to schedule only about 2.5% of growth in 2018 versus 2017, 3% when you include the fact that we had the Hurricanes in 2017. That number by itself is somewhat meaningful, but it's really important I think to understand and to try and understand what type of growth we're talking about in that 2.5% or 3% and how it relates to our existing set of assets.","So, you know, and to be clear, you know as we discussed at Investor Day, our network assets, our privileged set of assets is our [indiscernible] system. So, you know if we were to tell you for example, or that 2.5% to 3% here is what we decided, we are one of the biggest airline in the world, so we think we should serve the largest point of one [ph] market the United States.","So we're going to go out and [indiscernible] some airplanes and we're going to start adding service to San Francisco, Minneapolis, to Atlantic Houston, because those are really big markets, we will serve them non-stop. And like \u2013 and again we're a big airline, we think we should be in big markets. That would be growth outside of our core asset base and that would in engender a certain competitive response from those carriers that do have a strategic advantage in those markets because they always do have hubs on the other in those markets.","And over time we lose a good bit of money in those markets because we don't have local traffic and our competitors that have flow traffic filling up most of their seats and that would be not good growth for our shareholders. So look, well that's an example based on today's world. It's indicative of the kind of things we all used to see in the old days and I think again we're still a victim of our past when people just hear growth they think, well here they go again. And indeed that's the kind of stuff that happened.","It might be not so much that example, but what happened in the old days when in a less mature business, we airlines without real network assets were looking to use the good times to build some network assets and to take out the weakest when they did that. And that kind of growth tended to have much different kind of competitive impacts, competitive ramifications than what we're talking about here with our growth.","So let's talk about what we are doing. So we're not doing that at all. What we're doing is we're taking existing aircraft, increasing the utilization and redeploying aircraft from markets that maybe aren't doing quite as well to places where we know we can do well where we have real strategic advantage.","We're growing where we have a competitive advantage. We're creating better connecting markets. We're doing it in three ways; new cities and first off and this is, I know you noticed some changes from all those - we announced a couple weeks ago a schedule change through the summer which defines most of where we're going to be where that expansion is. So you can see it there, but we're some new cities and look there are some that get some attention and there are a little more exciting like regular [ph] Budapest and Prague, but you know the three cities that the three cities in the United States are South Bend, Missoula and Panama City. That\u2019s where we can create better connecting markets.","We connect - we don't fly to Panama City. We had Panama City to Dallas, we open up markets to the people of Panama City and people who want to get to Panama City that don't really exist today and certainly give them better connections than they have today. So, yes, I mean look, that's going to have - that means whoever is flying to Panama City today maybe lose a little share, but it doesn\u2019t start fare wars, that doesn\u2019t start. There's not an ability to \u2013 that doesn't engender some sort of enormous competitor response so what do you do. We're flying - we're just making our existing asset stronger and we're providing better service and better utility to customers as a result. So that's part of it, but it's not most of it.","The second thing we do is adding - add frequency to existing cities. That's a good bit of our growth. A lot of these cities have one or two departures a day. We take them up to three, you know, cities like Stillwater and Lake Charles get up to three departures a day instead of one or two. It has the same sort of effect and we just make the connections. We create more connections for our customers, make the hubs even stronger.","And then lastly and the biggest one is connecting existing cities to new hubs and this \u2013 look this is really, this is much of the promise of the merger. For example, American Airlines has always done really well in Oklahoma City for obvious reasons, proximity to Dallas. And we have a pretty strong base of customers there. But we've never flown from Philadelphia to Oklahoma City and that's one of the routes we announced.","Once we do that, we'll go certainly create unique connections to Europe for a customer base that flies a lot already. Similarly you know we flew Wilmington to Charlotte. We can fly to Dallas. So in our announcement you see new nonstop from Wellington Dallas, this just opens up customers and connections to places like Mexico, Ski markets, Hawaii, all of which are one stop markets a customer has never had. So of the 52 two new routes we added 47 of them fall into that category, existing cities and new hubs.","So look, that's where we are at American. We think it\u2019s smart efficient growth where we have competitive advantage. It doesn't result in yield decline, doesn\u2019t result in fare wars. It does mostly I think better and we're not spending enough time to suggest that his is all stimulus and it's not. But it just doesn't engender the kind of response that it feels like people seem to think, we're just looking at a number because we're doing what we think makes sense given our competitive advantage.","And again, I think one way to characterize this, we talked a lot about how we think the domestic U.S. airline market has become mature. I do believe that it's mature because we have three hub and small carriers that compete aggressively against each other that can take people all over the world with a lot of between national low cost carrier like Southwest and a lot of other competitors like the Jet Blue's and Alaska Spirits of the world intensely competitive but feeling very mature. Growing out hubs is just a continuation of that mature and perhaps kind of the final stages of that maturing business.","Because once you get to a point that those are your assets it makes sense I think to strengthen them and some of us are further along in that than others. So along when we saying look the number matters, but it - I think it always makes sense to go figure out where the growth is coming from and sometimes you can get over reactions to a number and just what encouraged people to go and look at where, what people are saying about actually where they intend to grow. So that's what we think. I don\u2019t ask if we changed our estimate based upon what we heard we have not - it doesn't - nor have we changed, nor do we have any plans to change.","Everything I just rattled off about our growth plans were in place before and remain in place now and we don't have any intention to change those based on what we know. And look we'll where people grow. We'll see where people decide to compete we will obviously respond where we think it makes sense, but it's always going to be around our core strategic assets.","Jamie Baker","Doug, if I were to para \u2013 that's very helpful exceedingly helpful. If I were to paraphrase that into a sound bite, do you characterize OA growth provided its hub centric and not uniquely damaging to the American Airlines franchise, yes or no?","Doug Parker","I'm not going to opine on other airlines growth. I spoke for five minutes and you gave me seven but I didn\u2019t say, so make your own conclusions from what I told you about Americans growth, but you know, look we're not here to talk about what other people are doing their networks. That\u2019s for them to decide and again we know who we are, we know the assets we have. We feel good about our growth and look all I'm pointing out is you can look at our 2.5%, 3% growth and so guess why do you guess it makes sense and I just gave you the answer.","Jamie Baker","Sure. My follow up will be American centric okay? So shifting this spotlight back to and thank you to indulging me, it's what people needed to hear, so forgive me for that first question.","Doug Parker","No problem","Jamie Baker","The high end of your 2018 EPS guide still falls around a billion short of that mid cycle $5 billion target. Revenue trends are looking good at the moment, labor pretty much industry wide has been remarked, but capacity is starting to creep, margins appear to have stagnated. I don't know it just sort of fuels mid cycle to me right now. So I'm wondering what's holding you or holding American back from achieving that $5 billion mid cycle target or should we just assume that the 3, 5, 7, needs to be downwardly adjusted maybe by a billion for each post?","Doug Parker","Absolutely not, on the last point. We continue to believe 3, 5, 7 are at range. We continue to - and again don't take our word for it. We just said our \u2013 we had our board meeting yesterday to set our 2018 objectives and our management teams bonus payments are based upon that in fact is our formula.","So that's how we're paying ourselves on short term incentive based on our ability to - not by the way, you\u2019re right our guidance doesn't have us there, so I'm not suggesting that our guidance has a setting, what I'm saying is it's still in the range up 3, 5, 7, and this feels like a year at least looking at it right now isn't one of the - is somewhat a below average year for our kind of steady-state [indiscernible].","The reason I believe that is, because kind of fuel prices have run up so quickly. And if you look, you know, as Derek stated I mean you're right, your numbers are right of course if you take them, I guess at the midpoint of our range kind of year-over-year earnings are pretty flat in our forecast.","Our pretax basis of course, after tax because the tax rate they\u2019re up a good bit, but on a pretax basis they are pretty flat. But look our fuel price alone is driving $1.8 billion our higher expense, so for us to be producing flat earnings on one of our - what's become again our largest cost going up by $1.8 billion, so it's a good bit. Now again, you should rightfully say, well gosh, if it's a real business that like you've been saying that we'll figure out a way to pass its cost increases along to customers like why don\u2019t you pass it on, there definitely is a lag on things like this. We saw it in, what year it was 2014 when prices fell really quickly?","How long it took for kind of capacity to respond to the new economics? And when prices go up this fast, it does, it takes a while to respond. So as we sit here today if oil stays where it is, I happen to believe you'll see the industry and you'll - the fares are too low for oil prices this high, and over time you'll see that adjust, but it takes time. part of it is that requires some capacity refinement, part of it is people have to believe it's there. This has gone from oil, but it's gone from what 50 to 70 in five months? 40% increase?","And it took a while for us all to think that 50 was a real number when it had fallen from 100 down to 50. It may take a while for people to really understand that if 70 is the real normal the new normal, you certainly will see I think us get to a point where we can produce the kind of earnings that you're talking about in $70 oil, but we've done it in $100 oil in the past. So any way long way we're saying it's - I'm not saying just because oil is $70 we can't make those numbers, what I'm saying is it's run up so fast it makes it hard to get there. If it falls back down quickly, we're absolutely right back in that range.","Jamie Baker","Doug, thanks for taking so much time. It's certainly appropriate if you want to dig my advantage account by 20,000 or 25,000 miles in light of the time totally fair. Thanks.","Doug Parker","Thanks Jamie. We\u2019ll do that.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker","Hi, team. Thanks for the time. It's kind of hard to follow that, thanks. That was a great explanation. I just have two questions, one can you say I know you don\u2019t report traffic, but I'm wondering if you can say what your loads are looking like and maybe you're bookings. How they're coming along for the rest of the quarter or as far along as you're willing to comment?","And then the other question is, is there a shift in mix that you are seeing like on the Atlanta kind of are you seeing more, I think you said maybe more premium traffic and a shift, but can you talk about the buy up that you may be seeing from like basic economy into the forward section of the cabin?","Don Casey","Okay, it's Don, so let me just start with the buy up. So we've had basic economy in the market now, but broadly domestically since September. We rolled it out to the Caribbean, the subset of Caribbean and Mexico markets in late November. The product is working entirely as we expected and so we're seeing the buy up rates that we expected to see and we're seeing the sell up amounts that we expected to see, so basic economy is really at this point working as designed.","In the Atlantic the premium market, we saw very strong premier performance last year. This was a combination of the product improvements that we've made. We didn't get to a fully life like product across our entire widebody fleet until June, July '17 and now we can have that product consistently in the marketplace. In addition to that we've changed some of the infrastructure that we use in revenue management to have more inventories which has led us to be more effective at pricing. And the combination of those changes have led to very strong Premium Cabin performance and in fact for the full year of 2017 revenue in the Premium Cabin was up 15%.","Doug Parker","And Helane, as you take a look at kind of the strength of bookings, yes we're seeing just a continuation of what we saw in December and so it's relatively flat, but that was a pretty good spot to be in.","Helane Becker","Okay, and then can I just ask a different cargo related question, because your volumes are up a lot and you're - obviously you reported a very strong number and you commented on Kevin's question, but I'm kind of wondering what are you carrying? Is this packages for Amazon, is it packages for the postal service which would be Amazon, do you know what's in those? I mean you must have to know what's in the bellies right? Because you have to know your customer.","Doug Parker","We do know the customer and I guess what I think\u2026","Helane Becker","That didn\u2019t come off the right way.","Doug Parker","I guess what I would tell you is, we've seen strength across the board especially from Asia, but the kind of things that you see out of Asia, phones and phone parts, when you think about telecommunications going down into Buenos Aires is another big one. We're seeing commodity like products, fish and salmon out of South America and Central America coming up that's adding revenue. We're seeing meat out of the South Pacific that are coming into the U.S., wine as well from Europe.","The air bags as everybody knows is still a driver of volume. So it's broad based and it's everything from technology to more food and perishables and so and then as well I would note that just general mail has been pretty strong too.","Helane Becker","Okay, great. Thank you so much for your help. I appreciate the team.","Doug Parker","Thanks Helane. Hopefully you\u2019re impressed by that answer because I know I was. All right, thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Daniel McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie","Hey, good morning. Thanks guys. Yes, Doug thanks from me as well for the wonderful response earlier here, it's very helpful to investors. But leave it to me to kick a dead horse here, so just going back to the opening remarks of strategic advantage of your hubs, how do we think about strategic advantage in those markets where American is not dominant but obviously important? So just reverting back to your opening remarks of investments in Los Angeles and Chicago, what's the key to achieving strategic advantage in these more competitive markets?","Doug Parker","Yes, first off, Daniel and strategic advantage doesn't mean we have to be number one. It means we have to have an advantage. In LAX we today are the largest, it's a definitely a fragmented market, but a very large market. Americans is the largest carrier there and we have the ability to continue to expand there as much as we're able to. The issue is LAX's terminal space and you know my comments were directed around the fact that we have been able to work out the situation with the Airport Authority we'll be able to expand there.","And Chicago is one more story, we're not the largest hub carrier in Chicago, but we're awfully close and another enormous market where we do well even though we're not the absolute largest and the good news is, we've just worked with the Airport Authority and five more gates there which allows us to become even stronger.","Derek Kerr","Yes, I'd just add one more thing. In a place like you know New York where we have great assets but same thing fragmented market highly competitive important for us to be there. We have to be different in some ways and we've done that with things like the shuttle product, the 321Ts, having three class domestic Transcon service and then making sure that with our partner BA that we're doing the best that we can with our JFK-Heathrow franchise.","Daniel McKenzie","Okay, I appreciate the perspective and then second question really is for Robert. The earnings release, well the cloud hosting and machine learning to speed time to value in the earnings release, so for those that are not AI programmers, can you help give us an idea of what the technology means for the income statement at this point, what could it mean at some point down the road? You know, my sense is that it is driving better non-fuel costs and better revenue, but is it material and you know can it become material at some point?","Doug Parker","Hey Dan, I'm going to let Maya Leibman, our CIO answer that for you.","Daniel McKenzie","Okay.","Maya Leibman","Hey Dan. Really the goal around adoption of these next generation technologies is the fact to that, we have so many fantastic ideas of things that we want to achieve and frankly there are just more ideas than we have the capacity to actually get through. And what we have found is that there's been this explosion in new technologies that allow us to basically take some shortcuts and get things done more quickly than we were previously able to do.","If we really adopt them in a thoughtful way, so cloud technology allows us to sort of circumvent the hosting process because it provides infrastructure ready to go. And machine learning and artificial intelligence allows us to create algorithms that are smarter and that learn as the context around them changes. And so we're really aggressively looking at these next generation technologies in order to work through this list of amazing ideas we have that ultimately generate value for the airline.","Daniel McKenzie","Got it. More on the cost side, more on the revenue side, if you could just help us understand?","Maya Leibman","Yes, on the revenue side we have a lot of fantastic opportunities that we're working with Don Casey's group on. On the cost side we have opportunities to really streamline our processes and the product that we provide. And a lot of it is really just better customer experience and we're very focused on providing things to our customers that really make the whole experience with American better.","Doug Parker","Yes, and Dan I would say for us to get the $3.9 billion worth of initiatives that we're talking about, this work will help us bring it in quicker and do what we need to do. Some of that is required a lot of IT help to get us done. We can't get there without the IT group helping us get through this and what they're doing is really helping us get through it quicker and figuring out ways to bring things in the market quicker on both the revenue and the cost side.","Daniel McKenzie","Thanks for the time guys.","Doug Parker","Thanks Dan.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. And Robert, I appreciate because we've gotten more airfreight discussions here on this call that I've heard probably in ten years of [indiscernible] calls.","Robert Isom","We're ready to go more.","Brandon Oglenski","Well, I'm going to ask a more nerdy analyst question about your EPS outlook, so we do appreciate the range, but to get to 650 if I just put in your guidance on cost, I'm getting to like a 7% to 8% range on revenue. And now my math is not perfect, but I think that's implying like a RASM north of 5% hit the top range assuming your TRASM stays where you've guided. So can you talk to - should we be thinking the upside of EPS as more cost base or do you really think significant revenue acceleration in this market is achievable?","Robert Isom","Well, first off, you should work with Derek and Dan. I think we don't have that type of number in order to get to the top of the range. It was like 3% to 4%, 3 at the bottom, 4 at the top, but points still now, but we have to make sure we're all working with similar math. Yes, based on what - where we closed the year and what we' think, the ASM growth is going to be next year, you would need 3% to 4% RASM growth. And but, we wouldn't have given that as our EPS guidance and we didn't think that was reasonable revenue guidance. We just grew a quarter 5.5%. So yes, it's and again if fuel prices stay where they are we think that well within the realm of possibilities.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, I appreciate the details there and then I do want to nitpick a little bit on CapEx because it looks like since your analyst meeting you've taken up the fin level about $0.5 billion for the next two years. Can you talk to you know it was this driven by tax reform or is just incremental opportunities that you found even before the tax rates came down?","Derek Kerr","Yes, I think there's two things. One is from an aircraft standpoint we did announce that we were bringing in ten more E175 aircraft to replace an outsourced contract that we had and take out some CRJ200s. So that's the increase on the aircraft CapEx side. From a non-aircraft CapEx side as Maya said there's just so much demand going on out there. Half of the project - there's seven projects that make up half of that \u201918 and \u201919 number. They are just major projects that we have announced and that we want to do as quick as we can which is we talked about Wi-Fi or [indiscernible] some facility projects.","We still have three big integration projects that we want to complete with our HR systems, our pilots, flight attendants and tech ops. So we're trying to bring those in as quick as we can and bring those in earlier. So we've raised the CapEx in \u201918 and\u201919 by $200 million each year for non-aircraft CapEx mainly due to those projects and facility projects and trying to get those brought in as fast as we can moving them forward. So those are the two big differences from the Investor Day. That's the ten new Embraer 175s and then just bringing projects in earlier in \u201918 and \u201919 and the major - the big projects that we have on our plate that make up half of each one of those years.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, I appreciate the discloser and the discussion in this call. It's been very helpful.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Brandon.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey thanks. I certainly respect the dynamic inputs to your planning process and fuel in particular, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how fuel is an input to your planning process and how you think about route profitability. In the old days we thought about red eye flying to leisure destinations as the first candidates for capacity trends. Of course this would put some upward pressure on your unit cost as you shrink today, but can you talk about how higher fuel impacts network planning and if it has started to lead to any cuts and if so what profile of markets that would include?","Derek Kerr","I'll go ahead and start with that. Right now, we have within our flight profitability system which gives us great detail in terms of where we are making money and gives us different views as to what expenses are more fixed and flexible in the long run. We've got a pretty good idea of where we're doing well and not and you know what the impact of variations of fuel expense are. So it's something that we look at certainly every month if not more and especially as we take a look out into the longer term.","So we've got a pretty good handle on it and at the end of the day we feel really confident with the schedule that we have built right now that we're profitable at these levels and that we're flying to where we ought to be. So I think we've got a good handle on both the short and long range plan for it. It's part of the process that we put the team through as we built the schedule. This is about what I can tell you.","Doug Parker","And Duane look, I remember the old days and the old days the reason you'd cut that point was because it was cash negative and it made sense to cut it as oil prices got to a certain level it was running close to that in today's world. So if we were to cut flying because oil prices ran up from 50 to 70 we would reduce profits and instead it turns into a $4 billion year instead of $5 billion year and over time we adjust pricing and capacity over time and adjust to where we think we're in the world fuel price starts to spell out. But yes, this is an entirely different world. It would be so from American's perspective going and reducing flying because oil prices went up from 50 to 70 would reduce the profits of the firm.","Duane Pfennigwerth","I appreciate that commentary and then just as a follow up maybe some data thinking as well, but with regional aircraft which have the highest fuel intensity, the highest sort of gallons per passenger if you want to think about it that way, obviously a lot less 50 seaters than there used to be and you're growing with 76s which are more fuel efficient, but where do you start to see the break points on fuel for regional lift? Is it 80 bucks, is it 90 bucks, where does that become more of a focus? Thanks for taking the questions.","Doug Parker","Yes, hard for us to answer. I don't know, we can't Duane. Again, whenever near the point of looking at - believing that fuel prices are at a level that we should be reducing, flying because it's all profitable and the regional fleet in particular because of what we said how it helps us create connections is among some of the best flying on a cash basis irrespective of where fuel prices are.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please proceed.","Mary Schlangenstein","Hi, good morning. Hey Derek, can we go back to your comment about the A350s? And you said you're working with Airbus and Boeing on another option from a widebody perspective and where to go on that. Can you talk a little bit more in detail on what you're looking at, what you're considering?","A - Derek Kerr","Yes, I mean we mean we currently have an order for 22, A350s that come in 2020. We're just looking at other options. There's nothing to announce right now. Whether, I mean our options are to take the A350, turn that into A330-900 or the other option is a 787-9. So there is - we have the order in place. The A350 is a great aircraft.","But it does add complexity to our fleet by a new aircraft type. So it's not about the aircraft, it's about the complexity that it brings to our operating group for having more aircraft. So we haven't made a determination yet. We may take the A350, but the other two options are A330-900 or 787-9 for that widebody lift.","Mary Schlangenstein","Is there a date by which you need to make that decision?","Derek Kerr","There is no date that we need to make that decision. I mean the first delivery is not till 2020.","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to - what the, you know obviously you've ruled out basically I mean this last year, what the plans for 2018 will be for that, did you see that changing in terms of giving customers more options to buy some of the things that have been subtracted out of that product? And then also do you see it expanding to other markets beyond domestic and then that near Caribbean stuff you guys did a little bit ago?","Derek Kerr","Yes, Conor as Don said earlier, the product has been out about six months now. It's meeting expectations which is great, will always take a look at ways to refine and optimize. And then I think as we've said before, we'll look at opportunities for you know application in other places. And so as you take a look internationally is it something that might be appropriate for transatlantic probably in a different form, but you know those are the kind of things that we think about there, but we don't have anything to announce. We like what's going on right now and we're staying the course with it.","Conor Shine","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Alana Wise with Reuters.","Alana Wise","Hi, everybody. Thanks so much for taking the question. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve talked a little bit about this already, but United or others speaking out seemed that they were going to be adding capacity at a fairly rapid clip, obviously, can share it down quite a bit and so concerns of the growing industry fare war. My question is just how are you at American addressing these concerns to shareholders and just what's the general view on capacity growth and how it's affecting the market.","Doug Parker","Yes, thanks. We did talk a little bit about this and the comment for the record is we're not going to pine on another airline. Growth plans, we're confident and Americans growth and very bullish prospects for American Airlines knowing everything we're going to do.","Alana Wise","Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question and answer session. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Doug Parker","We appreciate everyone's interest and thank you for tuning in. If you have any questions and you are an Investor, cal, Dan, if you have any questions and you are in the media call corp.com [ph]. Thanks so much.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. I'd like to thank everyone for their participation.

[Operator Instructions]","And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.","Dan Cravens","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the American Airlines Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.","Joining us on the call today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Kirby, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for question-and-answer session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Elise Eberwein, EVP of People and Communications; Bev Goulet, Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; and Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs.","We\u2019re going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some color on our guidance for 2015. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance; and then after we hear from those comments, we\u2019ll open the call for analysts\u2019 questions and lastly questions from the media.","Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast for capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our last Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30.","In addition, we\u2019ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com under the More About American Airlines Investor Relations section. Webcast of this call also will be archived on our website. The information that we\u2019re giving you on the call is as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us. And at this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Dan, and thanks everyone for being on. We are here to talk about our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 earnings. We announced this morning record earnings for the fourth quarter of $1.1 billion. That\u2019s up 153% over the prior year. And for the full-year 2014, record earnings of $4.2 billion. That\u2019s up 115% versus 2013. This is the best year in the long proud history of American Airlines, and the best year by a long shot, more than double the prior record. And we\u2019re extremely pleased to being reporting results like this just one year into our merger. It\u2019s the result of 100,000 hardworking team members, who have done just a phenomenal job of working together and taking care of our customers.","So we\u2019re grateful for them, and all that they are doing and continuing to do and will continue to do in the years ahead. These results allow us to do a number of important things; invest in our people, invest in our customers and return capital to our shareholders.","As to investing in our people, we hired over 7,000 new team members in 2014, including 2,300 flight attendants, 800 pilots, 300 mechanics. And in recognition of the outstanding performance, the company has done and our people have done, we instituted a 4% pay increase for all non-union employees below the director level, as well as for all of our contract employees that have reached joint contracts, joint collective bargaining agreements.","Our flight attendants have indeed reached a five-year joint collective bargaining agreement, which includes industry-leading wage rates. Our pilots are currently voting on a tentative agreement for a five-year joint collective bargaining agreement, also including industry-leading wage rates.","During the year, we prepaid our pension obligations by over $600 million. And based on current funding assumptions, we now have no required contributions until 2019.","As to investing in our customers, we\u2019ve continued our fleet modernization program. We added 132 new aircraft to the fleet in 2014 and retired 111 older ones. That will continue in 2015 as we plan to take delivery of 128 new airplanes and retire 126 older ones. American now has the youngest most modern fleet amongst our global network peers and that gap is widening every day.","We also announced a $2 billion product enhancement initiative, including fully lie-flat seats on our long-haul international fleet, satellite-based internet access on international flights, a refreshed and modern design for our Admirals Club lounges worldwide, and an improved and updated airport check-in experience.","And then we\u2019ve used the returns after investing in our product and our people to return to our shareholders. Earlier this year, we announced the first shareholder dividend at American Airlines since 1980. We\u2019ve continued that dividend in each quarter since the initial announcement including in today\u2019s quarterly results. We also completed our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program, more than a year before its expiration. And today, we announced the authorization of an additional $2 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2016.","So when you can do all these things well, you generally see stock appreciation. That\u2019s certainly been the case here. Now we at American Airlines, AAL, is not yet in the S&P 500, but we know that we will be one day.","And if you look at our results, we produced a total shareholder return of 113% in 2014, and had we been in the S&P 500, that have been the second best amongst all the S&P 500, behind by the way only Southwest Airlines, our competitor. So it was a good year to invest in Dallas-based airlines.","But this is not our first year of really strong returns. Our predecessor ticker, LCC, was up nearly 90% in 2013 and over 170% in 2012. So on a three-year basis, we produced a TSR of over 1000%. And that is by far the best of S&P 500 stocks and far in excess of anyone else, second place again actually. First in the S&P 500, but second if we were in it as a company with us with a 600% return. So we\u2019re really proud of that record. We understand we work for all of you and we intend to work hard to continue building upon as we look to the years ahead.","As to the outlook for 2015, we\u2019re really pleased with where we are, but we know we have a lot more to do. 2015 is going to be a key year for our integration; getting to single operating certificate; merging into single frequent-flyer programs; integrating our reservation system; achieving joint collective bargaining agreements with our remaining workgroups, all those things need to be done in 2015. And our goal is to accomplish all of those in the year. It won\u2019t be easy, but the incredible things our team has accomplished by working together thus far, gives us the confidence that we\u2019re on the right track with the right team.","As to our financial outlook, Derek will give you some guidance, but sufficed to say that we believe 2015 will be yet another record year, exceeding the results of 2014. We also expect our pre-tax earnings margins will be the best of our global network peers. It will be only our second year post-merger.","And then lastly from me, we are well aware that much of the tailwind pushing our industry in 2015 is due to a significant and recent drop in oil prices. Our perspective is that Brent was over $100 a barrel for nearly four years and it\u2019s been under $100 a barrel for merely four months. So we\u2019re going to continue to run American as though we\u2019re still operating with $100 per barrel oil. We think that\u2019s best for our investors, out team members and our customers in how we plan to keep running the business.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Derek, and then Scott and then we\u2019ll get back to questions.","Derek Kerr","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. In our earnings release filed earlier this morning you\u2019ll find information pertaining to our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 results.","As we talked about last quarter, please note that on a GAAP basis results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2014 shown today compares our post-merger performance to the 2013 GAAP financials for American Airlines Corporation, which includes results for U.S. Airways only for the period from the completion of the merger on December 9, 2013 through the end of 2013.","This makes the year-over-year comparisons not meaningful. As such, for the fourth quarter and full-year 2013, we have provided our financial results on a non-GAAP combined basis, which is the sum of American Airlines\u2019 and US Airways\u2019 results for the 2013 periods. We believe this is the best way to review our financial results.","You will be happy to know that this is the last quarter of these types of comparisons. Unless otherwise noted, all my comments will be based on the comparisons to the 2013 non-GAAP-combined results, which can be found in the press tables under the heading American Airlines GAAP Inc. Non-GAAP Combined Consolidated Statement of Operations.","For the fourth quarter, the company recorded a record GAAP net profit of $597 million. This compares to a non-GAAP combined fourth quarter 2013 net loss of $1.9 billion. Excluding net special charges, we reported a record net profit of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. This represents 153% improvement over the combined non-GAAP net profit, excluding net special charges of $436 million for the same period in 2013. Using 724.8 million diluted shares outstanding, we reported earnings, excluding net special charges of $1.52 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our pre-tax margin, excluding net special charges, improved by 570 basis points year-over-year to 10.6%.","Total capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 65.1 billion ASMs, up 1.7%. Mainline capacity for the quarter was 57.8 billion, up 1.5%, while regional capacity for the quarter was up 3.8 % to 7.21 ASMs.","As Doug said, in the fourth quarter, we took delivery of 20 mainline aircraft and retired 15 aircraft. On the regional side, we removed and parked 8 Embraer 140 aircraft and took delivery of 17 aircraft. We expect to end 2015 with close to flat aircraft count while we continue our fleet replacement program. We do expect to take delivery of 74 mainline aircraft and 50 regional aircraft, and plan to retire or park 104 mainline aircraft and 22 regional aircraft.","Total operating revenues were a record $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 2.1% from the same period last year. Passenger revenues for the quarter were $8.8 billion, up 0.7%, with yields up 0.9% on a 1.7% increase in system capacity. Cargo revenues were up 2% to $232 million, due primarily to higher freight volumes. Other operating revenues were $1.1 billion, up 14.4%, primarily due to higher frequent-flyer revenue, driven by our affinity card deal with Citibank announced in late 2013.","Versus the fourth quarter 2013, Passenger RASM was down 1% to $0.135. Total RASM in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $0.1562, up 0.4%, and Scott will provide more detail on our revenue performance and demand environment after my comments.","Airlines\u2019 operating expenses, excluding net special charges for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $8.8 billion, down 4.1% year-over-year. Mainline operating cost per ASM, excluding net special charges, was $0.1251, down 5.9% year-over-year on a 1.5% increase of mainline ASMs. We have seen a material financial benefit resulting from the recent decline in crude oil prices as we haven\u2019t hedged fuel.","Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $2.52 per gallon, on a 17.5% decline, versus $3.06 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding net special charges and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0867 in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 1.1% when compared to the same period in 2013. Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding net charges and fuel was higher by 0.9%. Excluding net special charges and fuel, our consolidated fourth quarter CASM was up 1.3% year-over-year.","We ended 2014 with $8.1 billion in total cash and investments, of which, $774 million was restricted. The company also has an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1.8 billion, bringing our total unrestricted liquidity to $9.1 billion.","As of December 31, 2014, approximately $656 million of the company\u2019s unrestricted cash and investments balance was held in Venezuelan bolivars, which decreased $65 million from the September 30, 2014 balance of $721 million.","During the quarter, the company returned $959 million to shareholders through the payment of $72 million in quarterly dividend and the purchase of $887 million of common stock or 20.5 million shares.","As Doug said, the company\u2019s $1 billion share repurchase program announced in July 2014 is now complete more than one year ahead of its scheduled expiration. When combined with $113 million spent in share repurchases in third quarter of 2014, the company repurchased a total of 23.4 million shares at an average price of $42.72 per share. As a result of these share repurchases, the net settlement of shares withheld in satisfaction of certain employee payroll tax obligations and the settlement in cash of our 7.25% convert, the company\u2019s fully diluted share count has been reduced from $756 million at the time of merger close to $719 million today, or a reduction of approximately 5%.","Company\u2019s Board of Directors has declared a $0.10 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2015 and also authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2016. For the full-year, we have prepaid $2.7 billion in high-cost debt and lease obligations, thereby lowering our overall cost to capital. We also contributed $781 million to our defined pension plans. And based on airline funding rules, we are over 100% funded, which is better than our network peers. Based on current assumptions, we are forecasting no recorded contributions until 2019.","Turning now to our 2015 guidance. We have lowered our full-year overall system capacity by half of a point and are now forecasting it to be up approximately 2% to 3%. This increase in capacity is primarily driven by increased gauge from aircraft deliveries, higher seat density through aircraft reconfigurations, higher completion factor and an increased stage length. Domestic capacity is expected to be up approximately 3% in 2015, while international capacity is expected to be up approximately 1.5%.","By quarter, mainline capacity breaks down as follows; 56.5 billion in the first quarter, 62.4 billion in the second quarter; 63.6 billion in the third quarter and 58.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Regional capacity breaks down by quarters as follows; 7.27 billion in the first, 8.01 billion in the second, 8.19 billion in the third and 8.11 billion in the fourth.","There has been a lot of talk of capacity changes in response to lower fuel price. You won\u2019t see any changes from us in the near future since we continue to run the airline as though high fuel prices will return. Even if we were inclined to be less discipline about expansion, our infrastructure is not set up to handle additional capacity increases above our current plans for at least 18 to 24 months.","Given our expected retirements and all of the additional trainings that has to occur as we take new deliveries to replace MD80s, 757s and 767s, we are using 100% of our training resources for the foreseeable future. Even if we wanted to increase utilization, we have to add simulators, hire and train new instructors, etcetera, and that\u2019s just not something that is practical to do just because oil prices are lower today.","For the full-year 2015, we\u2019re forecasting total CASM, ex-special items and fuel to be up approximately 3% in 2014. This increase is driven primarily by the cost of new labor contracts for both, flight attendants and pilots. In the event the pilots do not ratify the tentative agreement this week, then our cost would be approximately $600 million lower than today\u2019s guidance, which would be about 2.5 points of consolidated CASM.","Mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel is projected to be up approximately 4%, while regional CASM excluding special items and fuel is projected to be down approximately 5%.","By quarter, our mainline CASM ex-fuel and special items is as follows. First quarter is up between 5% and 7%, slightly higher than full-year due to maintenance timing and lower year-over-year capacity; second and third quarters are up between 2% and 4%; fourth quarter up between 3% and 5%.","Regional CASM excluding special items and fuel by quarter breaks down as; first and second quarters will be down 4% to 6%, third quarter down 3% to 5% and fourth quarter down 4% to 6%.","As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re seeing substantial financial benefit as a result of the recent drop in crude oil prices. With no fuel hedges in place, the entire change in fuel price goes straight to our bottom line. Using the January 22nd fuel curve, we are forecasting our 2015 consolidate fuel price to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.78 per gallon. Based on these prices, we expect our 2015 consolidated fuel expense to improve by more than $5 billion year-over-year.","By quarter, our forecast for mainline price breaks down as; first quarter $1.71 to $1.76, second $1.67 to $1.71, third quarter $1.74 to $1.79, fourth quarter $1.76 to $1.81. On the regional side; the first quarter is $1.75 to $1.80, second quarter is $1.71 to $1.76, third quarter $1.78 to $1.83, and the fourth quarter $1.80 to $1.85.","Using the midpoints of the guidance we have provided along with the PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect our first quarter pre-tax margin to be between 13% and 15%, an improvement of approximately 1000 basis points as compared to first quarter 2014.","While we expect to have a large increase in cash flow this year, resulting from lower fuel prices and merger synergies, we will continue to remain disciplined in our capital allocation process with a bias towards investing in the airline, paying down high-cost debt above our average cost to debt and returning excess cash to our shareholders.","Looking at CapEx, our focus continues to be on integrating the airline, while also making key investments in the fleet, product, operations and our people. We are forecasting total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $5.2 billion in 2015, with a capital markets as strong as they are today, I expect we will advantage of low financing rates to fund a greater portion of our aircraft deliveries, than the $1 billion in commitments that are currently in place for 2015.","In addition, we expect to invest a $1 billion for non-aircraft CapEx. We also expect $2.1 billion in debt repayments in 2015, which includes $800 million in prepayments of high cost debt.","So in summary, we\u2019re extremely pleased with our record financial results. Our more than 100,000 team members are the best in the industry and it\u2019s their efforts that make 2014 such an outstanding year. While lot of hard work remains as we complete our integration, we have made great strides in our first year following the merger, which we believe puts us on the right track towards our goal of restoring American to the world\u2019s greatest airline.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to go through the revenue line.","Scott Kirby","Thanks, Derek, and I\u2019d like to start by thanking all the people of American Airlines for the great job they continue to do operationally during the fourth quarter and again today as we\u2019re dealing with the winter storm in the Northeast.","On the revenue front, our fourth quarter PRASM was down 1%, which was worse than our original forecast for flat to up 2%. We can\u2019t really point to single event that causes to miss the forecast other than to say if there is a lot of change going on in our network, both from us doing things like increasing density on existing aircraft and from our competitors who have large competitive capacity growth in many AA markets during the fourth quarter.","In particular, there was significant capacity growth in some of our markets during the fourth quarter. We got new non-stop city pair competition in 50 new markets and 44 of those new entrants were low-cost carriers. While there are always competitive capacity changes, that\u2019s an unusually high and concentrated number of new starts that in hindsight we didn\u2019t accurately forecast.","Despite the growth in new domestic competitive capacity, however our domestic PRASM was still up 4%. We continue to do well across the Pacific with a 1% decline in PRASM despite 23% ASM growth. Our Atlantic PRASM was down 2% as industry capacity growth still exceeded demand in fourth quarter. And of course Latin America remained the most challenging region for us with RASM down 11%, though excluding Venezuela Latin RASM would have been down only 2%.","We\u2019re still making solid progress on our integration efforts and are pleased with the progress thus far. Some of the recent integration highlights that are included as Doug said, reaching a final joint collective bargaining agreement with our flight attendants, reaching a tentative JCBA with our pilots. We completed the eight of nine revision cycles on our way to achieving a single operating certificate, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year.","We completed additional airport collocations that are now combined in 75% of the airports where we have joint operations; launched Match My Account to help our customers combine their AAdvantage and Dividend Miles account in preparation for converting to a single frequent-flyer program in the first half of this year. We completed the reconfiguration of 221 737 800s moving them from 150 to 160 seats. We moved to single revenue accounting system in fourth quarter and we also continued to be excited about our progress with wining important corporate accounts.","We continue to see significant strength in New York from combining the two networks, and that helped us generate double-digit PRASM increases again in New York in the fourth quarter.","We know that 2015 is a big year for integration, but consistent with what we\u2019ve said previously, all the work we\u2019re doing leaves us confident that we\u2019ll be able to meet or exceed our prior synergy guidance.","Turning to the outlook, going forward, we continue to feel good about the demand environment, though there are some specific headwinds. With the possible exception of South America, demand remains good, though PRASM is being pressured in a number of markets where capacity is growing faster than demand.","Higher year-over-year completion factor will be an earnings positive that will negatively impact PRASM, and we expect currency headwinds in all international regions from the strengthening dollar.","As I said earlier, we saw some large competitive capacity growth in the AA markets during the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we have new competition in five more markets, but we\u2019ll still feel the impact of the 50 new markets that started in the fourth quarter.","Internationally, AA has reduced capacity by 8% across the Atlantic and by 7% to Latin America. The total industry growth is still high in all international regions. Given the capacity issues, we expect Q1 PRASM to be down in all regions except for the Atlantic, where we expect modest PRASM growth on the back of our capacity clutch.","Including all of the effects described above, we expect system PRASM to be down 2% to 4% in the first quarter. As we move forward, the comps, particularly the international comps get easier in the third and fourth quarter as we overlap the Venezuela situation and the challenges in Brazil and Argentina. And of course we expect to begin realizing the benefits of rebanking Dallas and Chicago in the second quarter, and to be able to realize the bulk of the revenue synergies once we move to a single reservation system in the fourth quarter.","In conclusion, we\u2019re very encouraged with the operating and integration results at American Airlines. And while there are some near-term capacity headwinds, the demand environment remains strong, and we\u2019re positive about long-term demand trends. With that, Doug.","Doug Parker","Thanks Derek. Thanks Scott. Operator, we are ready to begin taking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll pause for just a moment to give everybody the opportunity to signal. And we will take our first question from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene","Hi, good morning. Doug, I wanted to ask you about your views on the revenue side, because for a long time you\u2019ve sort of said, look, there is no point in hedging because fuel goes down, revenues eventually follow. So I realize demand plays a pretty big role in this question, but when you think about it, what\u2019s your best guess about when we start to see an impact on RASM from falling fuel, or is this time different and we may not in fact see that?","Doug Parker","I\u2019ll let Scott chime in behind me with more detail, but to be clear, I don\u2019t think we ever said Bill, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to hedge because pricing follows cost. Indeed what we said was for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the cost of hedging, but also the fact that it doesn\u2019t de-risk the firm, we didn\u2019t think it made sense to hedge. Events like we\u2019ve seen lately, large drops in fuel prices are really costly to companies that have locked in prices. And this time it happened to occur not because of a decline in the economy but they often times do, which gets you actually a more risky situation than others, but again if I said that Bill, that I\u2019d like to go back and clarify because the fact of the matter is if we felt that our prices were always tied to fuel prices, we wouldn\u2019t have been working at airlines that were losing billions of dollars when fuel prices went up and we couldn\u2019t raise prices.","What we believe is that, pricing is tied to demand, and that demand, as Scott said, remains strong and that\u2019s what we should base our pricing on, not based on our cost structure. Scott, why don\u2019t you\u2026","Scott Kirby","Yes. I think Bill what you maybe referring to is commentary we\u2019ve said where we talked about a natural hedge between a demand-driven decline in oil prices and our revenues. So the world economy got weak. That would lead - or the U.S. economy got weak that would lead to lower oil prices.","The difference now is this is a supply-driven decline in demand, we always have and always intend to, price to demand as opposed to cost, but this decline in oil prices is supply-driven event as opposed to a demand-driven event. And because of that, you see a disconnect between that oil and that airline revenue relationship that existed when it was - when the oil prices was being driven by demand.","Bill Greene","That makes sense. Let me just ask you one another question. Derek mentioned there is limited ability to flex up on capacity. In the event that we saw demand start to follow oil for whatever reason, or it just disappointed us for whatever reason, how much downside flexibility would you have on capacity?","Scott Kirby","Well, I mean we have a pretty fair amount because we\u2019re retiring aircrafts and we can just accelerate those retirements. We actually accelerated some of those retirements in 2015, but we\u2019ve got a couple of hundred aircraft that are scheduled to be retired over the next few years. We could always accelerate that if we want. Though obviously with our current outlook we don\u2019t have any plans to change that. We continue to look at demand - or continue to look at the environment and work on our capacity. And you can see that even as we came into this year just as we fine-tune the schedule, we lowered capacity by half a point. There is nothing systematic about that. That\u2019s just fine-tuning and going through market-by-market and allocating capacity.","But we have flexibility though, obviously if the environment stays like it is today and like we like we expect it to be, we don\u2019t intend to reduce beyond where we are right now.","Bill Greene","Right. That\u2019s great. Thanks for the time guys. I appreciate it.","Doug Parker","Thanks Bill.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Jamie Baker from JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Doug Parker","Hi Jamie.","Jamie Baker","Derek, are both operating entities fully harmonized in terms of frequent flyer accounting, or are there some other potential RASM implications as that process plays out down the road this year?","Derek Kerr","No, they are fully harmonized.","Jamie Baker","Okay. And I think you said Bev was in the room. Bev, could you outline what some of the, I guess, more material integration challenges and timings are that we should be aware of this year in particular, both in terms of what the passengers can come to expect, but equally if not more importantly, what the owners should be looking for?","Bev Goulet","Yes, sure, hi Jamie. We do have a number of big events coming at us this year. Scott mentioned a couple of them. You\u2019ll see us harmonize the frequent flyer program later this spring. We will be migrating the Dividend Miles program into AAdvantage. So that will be obviously something - it will be front and center with our customers, particularly the members of both of those programs.","Scott also mentioned we\u2019re in rev cycle eight of nine now, and we are well on the way and very much on track to single operating certificate also this spring. And then probably the biggest event is the migration of our res program and we have that scheduled towards the back of the year. A whole lot of planning going on there, because as we know from other experiences, the systems can work just fine, but if we don\u2019t have our employees fully prepared for all of those changes, things can still get muddled up. So, a lot of emphasis goes on IT preparedness as well as business readiness.","In terms of our owners, a lot of progress has been made on things like aligning sales contracts, GDS agreements and so forth, but clearly those efforts will continue as will alignment of supply contracts and things that will drop right to the bottom line. But we think we got a good plan. The whole company is really impacted by it as you know, so a lot of time communicating with our employees and giving them all the tools they need to really be fully prepared to make it as seamless as possible.","Jamie Baker","Excellent. Very thorough. I appreciate it Bev. Take care.","Bev Goulet","You too.","Doug Parker","Thanks Jamie.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the PRASM guide for the first quarter of down 2% to down 4%, have you changed anything in your forecasting process to eliminate some of the errors that impacted Q4\u2019s progression, or is this a case with two reservations systems, it\u2019s going to be a little bit tougher to be accurate until the systems are merged?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t know that we always try to improve our forecasting process and we always try to give you guys a 50\/50 forecast. I think it is fair in the fourth quarter. I think the biggest thing we probably messed was the impact of 50 new routes starting up. And while we knew that those - we could have known that those routes were starting up, we don\u2019t really built that into our normal forecasting process just because it\u2019s unusual.","And so we think we\u2019ve given you the best forecast we can, or you know we\u2019ve given you the best forecast we can. We think it\u2019s the right forecast. There is more volatility in our process right now than there will be at steady state, because we just have a lot of change going on. There is some of that that\u2019s between two different systems, but also we just have enough change going on that our volatility is higher than it will, than it would normally be or than it will be once we\u2019ve settled out and once we\u2019ve merged everything and are in more of a steady state performance, but we gave you the best forecast we could for the fourth quarter and we turned out to missed it. We\u2019ve given you the best forecast we can for this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to update you every month as we get better.","Julie Yates","Okay, understood. And then on the transatlantic, you mentioned that this is going to be the only positive region in the first quarter on unit revenues. Is there a risk to this given some of the competitive capacity addition from Delta and Virgin Atlantic? I believe they\u2019re increasing capacity about 10% on some of the route?","Scott Kirby","Well, there is always a risk to it. We feel pretty good about that forecast. The U.K. remains relatively strong, which is where we have the bulk of our capacity. And we cut capacity a lot. So while we said PRASM is going to be up, that\u2019s on the back of 7%, 8% - I think it\u2019s 8% across the Atlantic production in capacity. So PRASM is going to be up based on that. So we think that\u2019s what will happen, but obviously we can\u2019t know for sure until we get through the quarter.","Julie Yates","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Doug Parker","Hi Hunter.","Hunter Keay","So I don\u2019t have the cash flow statement in front of me, but I think ballpark, you guys are going to return about $1 billion of cash to shareholders despite maybe generating free cash flow of negative roughly $1 billion? You probably have about, I don\u2019t know, $1 billion to $2 billion is too much cash on the balance sheet. You\u2019re probably going to do, let\u2019s say, $1 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow. And Derek said you are going to raise at least $1 billion, maybe $3 billion of cash in the capital markets. Is there a scenario where if the market continues to penalize your stock with the amount of multiple compression that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months, where you return all of the $5 billion of fuel windfall to your shareholders this year even in the absence of, let\u2019s say, $5 billion of free cash flow?","Doug Parker","We\u2019re not going to get into those scenarios now.","Hunter Keay","Totally understand. Maybe let me put the question differently, Doug. I mean, did the market penalizing your stock because your stock did not go up as much as it should have based on EPS going higher. Did that factor in your decision to deploy an enormous amount of cash in the fourth quarter?","Doug Parker","Okay, let me try this. Let\u2019s see if this helps. We look to use our cash as follows. First, ensure that we have enough cash on hand to withstand any sort of unforeseen outcome, and more so than our other large competitors at this point in time given what we\u2019re going through, which is integration. So we look first to ensure that we have more than ample cash on hand. And then for cash - as for the uses of cash, that we have an excess so that we look to first invest in the business. We\u2019re doing that, and I think both in terms of the integration, as well as things like the $2 billion and customer improvements we talked about.","And then having done that - and then look to reduce any high cost debt, we\u2019ve done virtually all of that. I mean, Derek can tell you if there is more comment, but so far we are at the point now where we\u2019ve paid down everything that we could have at least that\u2019s above our cost of capital. And now we look to going forward, do you actually as you have airplanes coming in, do you go and actually pay cash for those, or do you finance them? And the reality is, at least in the current environment, it\u2019s definitely in our shareholders\u2019 best interest for us to at least go and invest some large percentage of the cost of those airplanes because you can do so at investment grade rates below 4%.","And we obviously believe we can use that cash better and get higher returns on that. So long way me saying, you get through all that, and I think the math you were going through, you end up with still cash left over if indeed we continue to produce earnings like we have in \u201814 like we\u2019re looking for \u201815. And that cash is yours and our job is to make sure we get it back to you as efficiently as possible. And we will continue to try to do that. I don\u2019t - frequently the biggest conversations we have is, what the most efficient way of doing that is? And what we certainly saw - now getting to your question. What we certainly believed as we were headed through the fourth quarter of 2014 was that our stock was undervalued, and we therefore thought it was in the best interest of our shareholders to use that excess cash to repurchase shares and we did that.","Hunter Keay","Yes, that\u2019s helpful, Doug. Thank you. And a question for Scott. Can you help us understand what the point of sale mix is on some of your international service as we sort of break it down between developed economies and emerging market economy? Like, is it maybe more balanced point of sale to say like a Western Europe than it is to some of your new China service or down in Latin America? At a high level, can you help me understand that relates - I\u2019m thinking about this in the context as FX risk, Scott.","Scott Kirby","Yes. So these numbers won\u2019t be exact, but Europe is about 50\/50 point of sale, China is more U.S. point of sale and Latin America very - deep South America which is where the challenges are is majority Brazil, Argentina, 70% plus of the revenue is being sold in South America. The Caribbean and Mexico is mostly U.S., particularly the Caribbean.","So, as you think about foreign exchange risk, I\u2019ll just give you some numbers. If you just took our mix of sales around the world from the fourth quarter. For those countries where we sell in euros or in foreign currencies, that would - if we just kept the same mix of revenue and nothing else changed, that would be 0.7 percentage point decline in system PRASM, which is baked into our forecast, but that\u2019s what it would - that\u2019s the impact.","That doesn\u2019t include the impact of a place like Brazil, where we sell tickets in dollars. And while we sell them in dollars, a 25% depreciation in the Brazilian currency is obviously going to have an elasticity effect. It also doesn\u2019t include that if you\u2019re American it\u2019s not cheaper to go to Europe for vacation. And so there is some offsets, but I think the currency impact is probably something a little less than 1% on PRASM. We have that offsetting CASM help - we do have some expenses in foreign currencies and obviously the impact on oil prices is even bigger.","So while it\u2019s a negative in the PRASM, it\u2019s probably an earnings positive to have a strong dollar when you consider all the effects.","Hunter Keay","Thanks a lot.","Doug Parker","Thanks Hunter.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Linenberg","Good morning. Hi, Scott, I just want to go back on - you talked about international capacity down 8% in Atlantic and Latin down 7%. Is that March quarter, or is that full-year? I just\u2026","Scott Kirby","That\u2019s first quarter.","Mike Linenberg","Okay. So that\u2019s first quarter. And then your point about the international comps getting easier in the third quarter and fourth quarter. I mean, I get the year-over-year impact with Venezuela, but as we\u2019ve seen things deteriorate in some of the other Latin regions and things like the Japanese yen go through a further depreciation. Like, what\u2019s underlying that? Like, what are you seeing, or is it just because you\u2019re going to see additional capacity come out? What\u2019s driving that view?","Scott Kirby","Well, Venezuela is two points at system level. So that\u2019s a huge tailwind. And that\u2019s by far the biggest impact in the third and fourth quarter. But we also look at Brazil for example, which the deterioration started in the third quarter - the Brazil and Argentina are two largest Latin geographies, where the deterioration started last year really in the third and fourth quarters.","And we anticipate improvement on a year-over-year basis as we get there, particularly as we started to pull capacity out and we\u2019ll continue to do that as we go through the year. So my commentary on the third and fourth quarter getting easier is more focused on Latin America than it is either Asia or Pacific, but particularly for the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll also start to have a tailwind across the whole system. Once we get to the single reservation system that will unlock a lot of the synergies that we can\u2019t realize until we\u2019re onto a single reservation system. That\u2019s more across the whole system, but the commentary about the international is more focused on South America.","Mike Linenberg","Great. And if I could just squeeze in a question for Derek on the debt pay down. I think you said $800 million in the last quarter or so. As you look out going forward, what are the opportunities on debt pay down, or is it just - are you at the point where lot of the stuff that was expensive has already either been taken care of, or you have debt out there that\u2019s already at pretty attractive rates, I guess there a lot more to do on the debt pay down front?","Derek Kerr","No, I think the $800 million is in \u201815. So we have two items in \u201815. One is going to happen in the first quarter and one will happen in the third quarter that are prepayment of debt. And then there is one in \u201816. But other than that, we have actually cleaned up everything and paid off everything as Doug said below - or above our cost to debt which is in just over 6% range. All of that has been paid off that we can. So there is not much other than the $815 million and then there is one item in \u201816. Other than that, it will be general just aircraft debt pay offs.","Mike Linenberg","Okay, great. Thanks everyone.","Doug Parker","Thanks Mike.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Helane Becker from Cowen & Company.","Doug Parker","Hi Helane.","Helane Becker","Hi guys. Thanks for the time. I\u2019m just kind of curious about this seemingly frivolous lawsuit the mechanics filed against you guys. How should we think about that with looming negotiations for the JCBA?","Steve Johnson","This is Steve, Helane. And I echo your characterization of frivolous. This lawsuit is really I think a more effort to get media attention than it is to pursue a real legal initiative, and we expect that the lawsuit will be dismissed in due course. While the motives of this guy, Gary Peterson who is leading this charge are a little confusing. I think it has a lot more to do with his fight for a place in his union or to lead the team of people to a different union.","I don\u2019t think that the dispute itself that\u2019s in the courtroom is going to have any impact on negotiations once those negotiations start going, but it very likely will have an impact on when we actually get to the negotiating table with these workgroups. And that\u2019s disappointing because we would really like to be able to expedite those negotiations and get our mechanics and all of our other ground employees to join collective bargaining agreements quickly.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then - thank you for that. I really appreciate the answer. And then I don\u2019t know if you can do this, but is it possible to parse out what percent, or can you say what percent of your business comes from like energy-related travel within Texas versus say the new markets that are competing with you to determine what impact lower energy prices is having on your corporate accounts?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t know for the whole system, but for corporate accounts that we would know that those are energy-related companies I believe is less than 1%. It\u2019s bigger than that, because there are lot of people that aren\u2019t on corporate accounts that are involved in the energy business that are flying on us or people that work for energy companies that go on vacation. So I don\u2019t know what the overall impact on our revenue and demand will be though. Clearly, that\u2019s a trade-off that we\u2019re happy to make to have lower energy prices in exchange for a little loss of demand from that segment of our traveler base.","Helane Becker","Great. Thank you for the answers.","Doug Parker","Thanks Helane.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Well, hi, good morning guys.","Doug Parker","Hi Dan.","Dan McKenzie","A couple of questions here. Derek, what were the NOLs as of December 31, first of all? And then second of all, is the $65 million drop in the bolivars in the fourth quarter a fair bolivar burn rate looking ahead?","Derek Kerr","Two things. One, the NOLs are still right around $10 billion. So that will not much change from the end. We haven\u2019t used any of that yet. So we\u2019re still at about $10 billion and then val allowance is at about $4.6 billion. The run rate on the Venezuela, I mean that\u2019s just what happened in this quarter. We are going to - we\u2019re using up some of them each quarter as we move forward. We did get some return to us during the quarter and we got it returned at - we had the 2012 on it 4.3%, and we got it returned at 6.3%. So we actually wrote a little bit of that off as you can see in the charge.","So we got about $20 million back. We wrote off about $30 million of it. So that makes up to $65 million. So I wouldn\u2019t - there is no real run rate on it. It\u2019s just going to be as it is and as it comes back to us as we get things returned from Venezuela.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. Okay. And then secondly, it looks like investors are interpreting that the PRASM guide probably this morning just given shares that are down a dollar in pre-market trading. So competitive capacity and overcapacity in international markets factors, but I guess the question is, how much of a PRASM drag is coming from larger incoming deliveries replacing the smaller ND80s? And I guess just tied to that, how effectively can you really revenue manage the additional seats on those planes, just given the mixed fleet composition at this point?","Scott Kirby","So the easier way to think about that, the bigger capacity impact I think is the 737s having 10 more seats on them. It\u2019s a more straight forward analysis. And that\u2019s we had 221 737s that got 10 more seats on them in the fourth quarter. And so all of the extra seats would be flying in the third quarter. We think that those seats will come in at about 65% of the average PRASM. So the marginal PRASM will be about 65%, which means that at a system level, effects PRASM by about 0.4 points. It\u2019s P&L positive because our marginal CASM on those extra seats is a lot less than 65%. So it\u2019s P&L positive, but it is about 0.4 percentage point drag on system PRASM.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. Thanks Scott.","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim","Good morning. With regard to international, the yields on Atlantic and Pacific were certainly encouraging. Obviously we look to see PRASM up as well, but I\u2019m wondering, is this yield improvement any sign of an early inflection, or is it too early to say?","Scott Kirby","I think it\u2019s probably too early to say. We at American have taken a lot of steps to try to improve yield and we spent a lot of time focusing on - we spent more time actually focusing on looking at the yield environments as opposed to load factor, because you can always keep the load factor up by lowering prices. And so there are a number of efforts underway. We have opportunity to increase the load factor, but we wanted to find ways to increase the load factor without negatively impacting those yield numbers, but I wouldn\u2019t interpret it as some inflection point. It\u2019s just a continued evolution of the market and the demand environment.","Thomas Kim","Okay. Fair enough. And based on your outlook and what you\u2019re seeing in LatAm, is there any reason why you couldn\u2019t be more aggressive in cutting capacity?","Scott Kirby","I think we feel pretty good about how far we\u2019ve gone. And of all the carriers we track, we\u2019re the only ones that have cut capacity. And so I think we\u2019re probably - at least our plan is we\u2019re done in cutting.","Thomas Kim","Okay, and if I could just add a follow-on. Where does this extra capacity go?","Scott Kirby","What extra capacity?","Thomas Kim","As you reduce capacity, where does that incremental capacity go within the system?","Scott Kirby","We wound up - we in 2015 have retired more airplanes than we originally planned to.","Thomas Kim","Okay, great. Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hi, good morning.","Doug Parker","Good morning, Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Most of my questions have been asked, but I just wanted to ask you for some thoughts around hedging. Can you talk about any work you\u2019ve done to sort of analyze whether now is the right time? And if you won\u2019t bite on that, I guess, can you describe a scenario where price or situation where your answer might change and where it might make sense?","Scott Kirby","So we get questions like that a lot. I\u2019ll note that I first started getting those questions first time when oil declined from $115 to $103. So you get it lot every decline. Look, you still have the same challenges with the deciding that you want to speculate on oil prices. And one, you\u2019ve got to - you can\u2019t buy oil at today\u2019s prices far out into the future. The market is in pretty steep contango, so it\u2019s hard thing to go do. And the only rationale for putting a position on systematic hedging we\u2019ve talked about on calls like this just doesn\u2019t make sense is to put a big position on.","And you\u2019re buying at a really steep contango. You got really high expenses, and somehow you\u2019ve got to convince yourself that you know better than all the professionals in the oil market here out trading in the market. So that\u2019s a really hard hurdle for us to overcome. It doesn\u2019t mean we never will, but we haven\u2019t done anything yet. And all the rationale that we\u2019ve had for not hedging in the past still exists today. Oil prices are lower, so the downside of hedging is less. If you\u2019re wrong, you\u2019re going to lose less money than if you hedge when oil was $115 a barrel. But the theoretical rationale for not hedging really hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s just that the downside has gotten less.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thanks Duane.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will now take our next question from Glenn Engel from Bank of America.","Glenn Engel","Good morning. Question on cost and revenue. On the cost side, if I look at how much wages are going up, it would cause the costs to go up more than maybe 3% to 4%. So, what\u2019s the good guys that are offsetting the big labor cost pressures? And on the revenue side, the Atlantic down 1.7% was worse than Delta and United. Why was there a gap, and why does the PRASM gap between what you and Delta and United seem to be getting wider in the first quarter? Why hasn\u2019t it stabilized?","Derek Kerr","Okay. On the cost side, we\u2019re seeing some of the synergies already come in. So the selling expenses are down a good point, even the other expenses are down. Landing fees and aircraft rents are pretty flat. So really the increases on the year for the quarter are salaries and benefits as we talked about, maintenance and depreciation are the other two increases during the quarter. But for the full-year, we\u2019re going to see salaries and benefits up, but we do see selling expenses and maintenance decreasing year-over-year, primarily due to fewer engine overhaul. So those are the primary areas from a full-year perspective. Just the difference in the first quarter is just the maintenance timing is negative in the first quarter, but for a full-year, it\u2019s almost half a point better as are the selling expenses as you get through the year. So those are the two biggies that offset the salaries and benefits and the depreciation increases.","Scott Kirby","And on the revenue front, I think the simple explanation is more competitive capacity in our markets, 50 markets, some of those are across the Atlantic, Dallas and Washington National are the two largest, those are well known, but there is also been pretty significant growth from Frontier in Philadelphia and to some degree Chicago. So I think we just have more markets that are now have LCC pricing in them and that really ramped up and started in the fourth quarter and ramps up even more into the first quarter.","Glenn Engel","And the Atlantic?","Scott Kirby","It\u2019s same issue. There is - you got more capacity, some of the new markets are out of the U.K. Virgin and Delta and reorient and fly more out of Heathrow.","Glenn Engel","Thanks.","Doug Parker","Thanks Glenn.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi from UBS.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi guys.","Doug Parker","Hi Darryl.","Darryl Genovesi","Thanks for the update on your synergy targets. I just wondered if you can put a little meat on the bones that you have, your 3% CASM and fuel guidance out there now. So wondering specifically if you could quantify the cost synergies are already baked into that as opposed to what you think is yet to come through in 2016 and beyond, as you cut over to single reservation system, and generally target the legacy cost structure?","Scott Kirby","I would say from a cost perspective, most of the synergies - I would say 75% of the synergy is already built-in. So the increase is due to labor offset by some of the synergies that we talked about on the sale side and those are - there are other areas that we will see as synergies going into 2016 after integration, which are some areas - and examples are the maintenance area today and the IT area today are all, we have not had any synergies in either one of those areas from a people perspective, but we may see some of those as we go forward.","And as we retire systems down the road, we will continue to see some synergies in those areas. So I would say about from a cost perspective, 75% of those synergies are built-in already into the forecast through 2015 and there is about 25% more to come. And then on the revenue side, I think we might be at about 50% now with more to come in 2016 and \u201817.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thanks very much.","Doug Parker","Thanks Darryl.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Savi Syth from Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hi, good morning. Just as far as - I believe most of competitive capacity issues are probably surrounded around Dallas. And I\u2019m just wondering if the pressure that you\u2019re seeing and some of it is introductory fares. I was wondering if there is any improvement in the fares in Dallas? And then also if you can help us understand maybe how the rebanking might help that as you get into 2Q and 3Q?","Derek Kerr","Sure. So I don\u2019t think there has been any real change in the pricing environment in Dallas. Rebanking will help - I\u2019ll take one step back. What has happened in those Dallas market is there has been a decline in the local yields as prices have come down. Our local volumes have actually stayed about the same. So the load factor contribution from local traffic has stayed about the same. But we\u2019ve managed to improve the connecting RASM to counteract some of the decline in loss of the local RASM. So rebanking will help with that, because we\u2019ll have even more connecting opportunities in those markets.","So rebanking will help. It will just help of course - of course it will just help the markets that have new competition from Love Field will help all the markets, but it will help all those markets in Dallas on March 29th when we get it rebanked.","Savi Syth","Got it. And then just on the LatAm PRASM. How much of impact from Venezuela is reflected in 1Q, and what\u2019s the expected trend as you go forward in the next few quarters?","Derek Kerr","Well, it was 2 points in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s only about 0.5 point in the first and second quarter of this year. And then it\u2019s essentially nothing in the third and fourth quarter.","Savi Syth","Got it. And if I might ask one last ask questions on New York, its strong unit revenue growth. Is that coming from kind of market share gains on the corporate side, or is it better pricing, or what\u2019s driving that strength?","Scott Kirby","I think it is mostly market share gain with corporates and pretty new customers.","Savi Syth","All right, great. Thank you.","Doug Parker","And before the next question operator, the question about Dallas gives me the opportunity to correct something I said earlier. In my unscripted remarks, I said to Dallas-based airlines performed at the top of the industry. We of course are based in Fort Worth here at American. So I should have said Dallas\/Fort Worth-based airline and I apologize to Mayor Price and all of our friends in Fort Worth who remind me all the time. We are proud to be here at Fort Worth. So anyway, Dallas\/Fort Worth-based airlines and Scott\u2019s comments were about Dallas\/Fort Worth-based pricing. All right, next.","Operator","Okay. And we\u2019ll go now to Joe DeNardi with Stifel.","Joe DeNardi","Thanks. Good morning. Scott, on the strength of the other revenue line, the ancillary side, what\u2019s driving that? Does that going to continue into 2015? And then as you combine the two frequent-flyer programs, do you think that the economics you\u2019re getting from that from your credit card partners are reflected in kind of how strong that\u2019s going to be on a combined platform?","Scott Kirby","So some of what you\u2019re seeing is improvement in the frequent flyer and in the deals we negotiate. That\u2019s a lot of it. A lot of it is harmonizing policies. So for example, we have bag fees on the American Airlines network in Mexico now when we did in last year. So those items won\u2019t continue to have the same kind of growth as we overlap when those events happened, and there is about bunch of those things. The biggest one is the frequent flyer program, which will already be overlapping in the first quarter, but a lot of those rolled out Mexico bags and other things rolled out throughout the year.","So there will be some of that. More of the upside now will be driven from new initiatives and new programs. We have a lot going on with choice seats for example in how we\u2019re selling seats on the airplane. And so those will continue to grow, but we had a step function increase up from the merger as you just consolidated and realize synergies from that. And those mostly are already in the books. And going forward, it will just be kind of core improvement that aren\u2019t synergies but that are just things that apply to whole airline.","Joe DeNardi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bob McAdoo with Imperial Capital.","Bob McAdoo","Hi guys.","Doug Parker","Hi Bob.","Bob McAdoo","You\u2019ve added quite a few Pacific routes out of Dallas recently. And it doesn\u2019t show up as a problem area because maybe it\u2019s the prior year the RASM was so low that even now the new stuff looks better. So can you just talk about how the spool-up of Pacific route out of Dallas works relative to other international routes? And when do we - do we really think if those things are profitable in the short run, does it take a year for those things to develop? Just give us some color on that, if you would, please.","Scott Kirby","Sure. When we enter a new city in Asia, it typically takes longer to spool-up. Some of that is because we\u2019re smaller there. And particularly when you enter a completely new city like we went into Seoul, Korea. When we\u2019re going to start flying Dallas, Beijing the spool-up will be shorter, because we already fly to Beijing. That\u2019s why the spool-up is shorter, but we typically think of an Asian route as taking a couple of years to spool-up.","And in 2014, some of those new routes weren\u2019t profitable at the time, though they were executing our forecasts and we felt actually really good about the start-ups that we had in 2014. If we look that today, I don\u2019t have a specific forecast that goes route-by-route, but I\u2019m pretty sure that with fuel prices where they are today, we\u2019d expect all of our - even our Asian route to be profitable in 2015, but we felt really good about how all the routes have started. You\u2019re right, they take a longer time to spool-up than other routes, but we felt really good. And you can look at our numbers. Asia is the one area that we\u2019ve been outperforming the industry by a pretty wide margin for the past, for the full year last year.","And so we\u2019re making good progress. Some of that is because we started from a lower base and so we have more room to make progress, but we are making good progress and feel good about the trajectory that we\u2019re on.","Bob McAdoo","Are we getting close to the end of all the new Asian routes for a while. Are all the obvious getting about discovered?","Scott Kirby","No. We are probably at the end of the new Dallas route, but we\u2019ll still be looking and pursuing opportunities probably particularly out of Los Angeles.","Bob McAdoo","Okay. Thanks.","Doug Parker","Thanks Bob.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the analysts\u2019 portion of the question-and-answer session. We will now move to the media portion. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to give everybody the opportunity to signal. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go now to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","Good morning.","Doug Parker","Hi, Mary Schlangenstein.","Mary Schlangenstein","Thank you very much. Scott, you talked about some of the domestic markets where you said PRASM was under pressure because of increasing capacity. Beyond the four that you specifically mentioned, are there any others where you\u2019re seeing a big impact, and are there any international markets where you\u2019re specifically seeing an impact?","Scott Kirby","What four did I mention?","Mary Schlangenstein","You mentioned Philadelphia from Frontier and little bit Chicago, DCA and Love Field.","Scott Kirby","There is not - okay. Yes, there is 15 markets and they are concentrated in, I\u2019ve said those four cities. I think probably the other place that there is some significant growth is South Florida.","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay. And I would assume that you\u2019re working on ways to try to offset some of that, or what are you doing in response?","Scott Kirby","We\u2019re competing aggressively. We have a great product. We have great people at the airline. We have a great frequent flyer program. We are matching the fares with our low-cost competitors and we\u2019re competing aggressively.","Mary Schlangenstein","Great. All right, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Terry Maxon from Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","Guys let me ask the Fort Worth question, not whether you\u2019ve offended Betsy Price, but are you - were you considering whether or not to move out of your current headquarters to a new building or perhaps remodeling, revamping your existing building?","Doug Parker","Yes. We\u2019re not basically far long at all, Terry. We again haven\u2019t even made the decision that\u2019s something we want to do. We\u2019re studying the possibility as to what might be available, but we have an perfectly acceptable facility that we\u2019re working in today. To the extent there is something that makes more sense we\u2019ll - we want to at least look to see if that makes sense and that\u2019s where we are. We are in the studying phase, certainly not in the announcement phase.","Terry Maxon","All right. When do you think you might complete that study, first half of 2015 or\u2026","Doug Parker","It is not high on the integration timeline. So I don\u2019t even know a date.","Terry Maxon","Right. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig","Hi guys. Derek talked about using cash invest in the airline and he mentioned that even before paying down debt and paying shareholders. Doug, I wondered to look at it another way, are you saying to passengers, hey, we\u2019re improving the product and passenger should be happy about that instead of just getting a temporary lower fares because of cheaper fuel. Is that a fair characterization?","Doug Parker","We\u2019re not trying to ask our customers to be happy with anything. We think - indeed what our job is to go make sure we\u2019re giving the best product we possibly can to our customers. We, in some areas, I think all airlines had underinvested through very difficult times, and we are using the profits we\u2019re producing to invest in product that matters our customers. Most notably lie-flat seats, international Wi-Fi, improving the Admirals Clubs, improving the airport check-in experience, things that are really important to our customers, all of which take a lot of capital because we\u2019re profitable we can do it now and things that airlines couldn\u2019t do in the past. So that\u2019s our first priority is ensuring we have a product that meets the standards of our customers, which are very high at American Airlines. And we have a little bit of catch-up to do. We\u2019re doing that - we believe we will be leapfrogging our competitors shortly. And not to mention all the new aircrafts we\u2019re bringing in to retire older airplanes.","You put it all together and we are on our way to having a product that we believe will be as good or better as anyone in the sky and that\u2019s our objective. So anyways - and pricing simply goes with demand as we keep saying. So when demand is strong, you see price move accordingly. When demand drops, you see pricing move accordingly.","David Koenig","Okay. Thanks very much.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles","All right. So since I have a Fort Worth question at ask, I think I will ask a little bit about, could you expand a little bit more on the Wright Amendment effect, and just do you think you\u2019re out of that promotional pricing aspect of the new routes that were introduced, are you seeing a more normalized airfares on those new routes that Southwest introduced that you\u2019re competing against DFW?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t know, is the short answer. We haven\u2019t really seen a change. It\u2019s about what we expected when you have that much new capacity in markets. It\u2019s going to put pressure on price. That\u2019s just Econ 101 with supply curve moves that much it lowers the price. And it\u2019s about what we expected. I haven\u2019t really - we haven\u2019t noticed any change one way or another in the recent past.","Andrea Ahles","So how do you foresee rebanking? Is that more - do you think rebanking effect is just going to be more for the connecting traffic and not so much effecting your O&D traffic out of DFW?","Scott Kirby","It will largely impact connecting traffic, yes.","Andrea Ahles","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Dawn Gilbertson with Arizona Republic.","Dawn Gilbertson","All right, good morning. I have a question about the storm and Super Bowl. How are you guys re-accommodating passengers whose flights were cancelled Monday, Tuesday and sometimes into Wednesday later in the week given sold-out flights to Phoenix?","Scott Kirby","Dawn, I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. Just in terms of Super Bowl preparations, I got to tell you that it\u2019s an event that we\u2019ve been working on for the last year. And so everything from preparing for really the biggest day in history of departures, the Monday following, we\u2019re going to have remote check-in sites at a number of different places for passengers and also ability for passengers to check baggage. We\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019ve got staffing that is beyond holiday and peak levels. And we think we\u2019re as prepared as we can possibly be.","In terms of flight cancellations and things like that, we run a really high completion factor so we don\u2019t anticipate that that\u2019s going to be an issue, especially out of Sky Harbor. And in terms of re-accommodations, the great news is that the Sky Harbor and the American Airlines is now connects to the biggest airline network in the world. And so if there are any disruptions or issues, we have many ways to get passengers out and back on their way.","Dawn Gilbertson","I guess, well what I meant was the storms in the Northeast. If you\u2019ve got patriots fans coming from Boston and they haven\u2019t been able to fly yesterday afternoon, today and in some cases tomorrow, and you\u2019re trying to rebook them to get to Phoenix. So you having to add extra flight since the flights that are already scheduled for Thursday and Friday and Saturday out here are full?","Scott Kirby","Dawn, we take a look at that kind of stuff, but right now we\u2019re anticipating that we\u2019re through the mess by the 28th and back to normal.","Derek Kerr","Yes, Dawn, I think we\u2019re still in planning mode and we\u2019ve got - we will have thousands of customers to try to get to their destination both to Phoenix and to everywhere. And it\u2019s too early for us to tell what\u2019s going to happen from the schedule for the next week [indiscernible] those customers.","Dawn Gilbertson","Okay, thanks.","Doug Parker","Thanks Dawn.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Jeffrey Dastin with Thomson Reuters.","Jeffrey Dastin","Thank you and hello. So would American consider announcing commercial service to Cuba, pending government approval like United has done from New York and Houston? And if so, what benefits might Cuba have for American?","Scott Kirby","So we already - we currently fly 20 times a week with the charter program to Cuba. We obviously with the hub in Miami in particular, will serve Cuba on a scheduled flight basis when it\u2019s allowed. We don\u2019t have anything to announce today, but we will be anxious to start serving Cuba as soon as it\u2019s legally allowed.","Jeffrey Dastin","Great. And if I may follow-up separately. How crucial is a slot at Tokyo Haneda to American\u2019s expansion in Asia?","Scott Kirby","Well, it\u2019s really important. Haneda is the preferred airport for customers flying to and from Tokyo. It\u2019s the number one destination at Tokyo and Japan, this is the number one destination for us and it\u2019s the preferred airport. And it\u2019s important for us to get in there. It\u2019s also important for our customers and that\u2019s a valuable asset, a slot at the premier airport in Japan and to have it be used 10% of the time that it could be used, which is what Delta has used it is an inefficient use of that, scarce resource, and we will put it to much better use.","Jeffrey Dastin","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Ely Portillo from Charlotte Observer.","Ely Portillo","Hello, I just had a question about, now that you have the 787 coming in, and that\u2019s part of the fleet. Does that change your thinking about what kind of flights might be possible from a hub like Charlotte internationally and how might that impact service going forward?","Scott Kirby","The 787 and then the A350, when we get those two open up a new set of markets to us and a new set of economics. In the near-term, it\u2019s not going to have any change in Charlotte.","Ely Portillo","Got you. And just out of curiosity, does it come into Charlotte at any time in the near future just on a hub-to-hub flight?","Scott Kirby","Not that I\u2019m aware of. I don\u2019t think so actually.","Ely Portillo","Well darn. Thanks guys.","Scott Kirby","You can travel to Dallas, Ely.","Ely Portillo","Okay. Now I have an excuse. Thanks.","Doug Parker","Dallas\/Fort Worth that is.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Ted Reed from The Street.","Doug Parker","Hi Ted.","Ted Reed","I also wanted to ask about 787 deployment, what do you have in mind for it? And I recall that Gerard Arpey once said it was going to be used New York\/Heathrow. Is that still the case, or are you more looking at Asia, or new routes or existing routes or what?","Scott Kirby","We don\u2019t have anything to announce yet. It\u2019s going to be a while before it starts flying commercially. It\u2019s doing improving runs and then initial training runs with pilots and so it\u2019s always before starts flying. When it does start flying, it\u2019s going to initially fly domestically anyway to break the airplane in. So no announcement yet on the permanent international route that it will fly.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","End of Q&A","Doug Parker","Well, thank you all very much. Just in closing again, we couldn\u2019t be happy with the results and the outlook as if we hit those margin numbers that Derek suggested, we believe those will be leading amongst our large competitive peer group since we\u2019re the largest airline in the world, we have higher margins. That means we\u2019re the most profitable, which was one of our objectives. So we still have to go produce that, but it appears that we\u2019re on our way and we\u2019re excited about that and mostly excited about the great job our team has done. So thank you all very much for your interest, and look forward to continuing to produce record results as we move forward. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference, and we do thank you for your participation."],"1451":["American Airlines Group, Inc.

Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.","Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Shannon, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for the Q&A session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.","We're going to start the call this morning with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the second quarter, provide some additional information on guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on our operational performance and revenue environment. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call to analysts' questions, and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans, and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit, and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com. The webcast of this will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on today's call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us. At this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for joining us, everyone. This has been a challenging quarter for American Airlines. In fact it's probably the most challenging quarter we've faced since our merger in 2013. First and foremost, the computer outage at PSA in June was extremely disruptive to our team and our customers. Our team members did heroic things to address that issue and take care of our customers, but we regret the inconvenience that we caused for so many.","In addition, higher fuel prices have materially reduced our earnings. The increase in fuel price alone drove our second quarter 2018 expenses up by over $700 million, which led to a $593 million decline in year-over-year pre-tax earnings excluding special items.","And our passenger revenues, while still growing, trailed the growth rates of our two largest competitors. This occurred for the first time since 2016 in the first quarter of this year, but it widened in the second quarter. And if everybody's forecasts are accurate, it's projected to widen in the third quarter as well. Now, a lot of that shift is explained by entity mix, specifically relative weakness in Latin America and by more difficult comparisons versus last year. But some of it's underperformance in the United States, which is a cause of concern for us.","As a result of these trends, we lowered our 2018 EPS estimate to between $4.50 and $5.00 per share versus $5.27 in 2017. This decline in earnings has some in the investment community questioning our ability to again achieve our target annual pre-tax earnings of $5 billion within the foreseeable future. The question we generally get is, look 2018 is a pretty good year economically, yet we have the earning only approximately $3 billion pre-tax in 2018, so do you still believe American is an airline that can produce profits averaging $5 billion per year? The answer to that question every time is, of course we do.","Our projected 2018 fuel expense would be over $2 billion lower if prices had simply stayed at 2017 levels. And we earned a little over $4 billion pre-tax in 2017. Had fuel prices not run up so far, so quickly, we firmly believe that 2018 would have been a year where we again produced $5 billion in pre-tax earnings. The solitary fact that fuel costs have risen, and the impact of that increase has not been offset immediately doesn't alter our view about the steady state earnings potential of American Airlines.","But fuel prices have in fact risen, and importantly they've held at these elevated levels for several months now. To the extent any of us were viewing this quick run-up as a spike that would quickly correct itself, we should abandon that notion. We at American are assuming that $75 a barrel Brent crude or higher is our new reality, and we intend to adapt our airline to one that can make $5 billion per year at these fuel prices.","The fact is there are many activities that make sense at $45 a barrel of oil, which no longer make sense at $75 per barrel. We're taking aggressive actions in the immediate term, including lowering our 2018 capacity growth, reducing our non-fuel expenses, and deferring future aircraft deliveries and CapEx. We're also adjusting our Basic Economy product offering to become more competitive. Robert and Derek will describe those actions in more detail shortly.","We also feel very good about our plans moving into 2019. We anticipate American will continue to grow at a rate lower than any other U.S. airline, despite the fact we have what we believe are the industry's best growth prospects. In 2019, American will acquire 15 more gates in Dallas-Fort Worth and seven more gates in Charlotte, North Carolina, which are our two most profitable hubs. And of course, we still have the upside of the strategic initiatives we discussed at our Investor and Media Day last September. As a result of these actions, we are confident American will return to both revenue outperformance and earnings growth in 2019 and beyond.","And most importantly, we are excited about the long-term future of American and the airline we're building. We remain absolutely committed to our efforts to build a better and more competitive American and increasing shareholder value over the longer term.","We're creating a world-class customer experience by continuing our extensive investment in improving our product with the youngest fleet among the largest U.S. carriers, industry-leading high-speed satellite Wi-Fi, best-in-class Admirals Club and Flagship Lounges, investments in our airports, including our upcoming expansion at DFW and Charlotte, and the reimagining of our terminal space at LAX and O'Hare. We are expanding our network intelligently, while also pursuing regulatory approvals for our joint business agreements with our partners at Qantas, LATAM, and Aer Lingus.","We're making our culture a competitive advantage by dramatically sharpening our focus on leadership, communication, training, inclusion and diversity, and creating an environment that cares for our frontline team members. And we're working to ensure the long-term financial strength of American by smartly maximizing our network, optimizing our fleet, and improving our revenue performance by harmonizing our fleet configurations and through further cabin segmentation.","We continue to maximize the value of the world's leading branded credit card, the AAdvantage Mastercard, through innovation such as our new no fee AAdvantage card, which just launched two weeks ago. As a result, we remain on track to deliver on the strategic initiatives, driving $2.9 billion of revenue expansion and $1 billion of cost improvements that we committed to at our Investor Day presentation in September. And because of all that, and primarily because of the amazing team we have at American, we are very bullish on the future of American Airlines.","That said, I'll turn it over to Derek, who will be followed by Robert, and then Q&A. Derek?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our team members who are doing a great job taking care of our customers during this busy summer period. Their hard work and positive attitude continues to be fundamentally important to our success.","We filed our second quarter earnings press release and 10-Q this morning. The significant increase in fuel price led to lower year-over-year earnings. Excluding net special items, we reported a net profit of $757 million in 2018 versus our 2017 net profit of $1 billion. Our diluted earnings per share excluding net special items in the second quarter of 2018 was $1.63 per share, beating consensus of $1.59 per share. Excluding net special items, our second quarter pre-tax profit was $1 billion, with a pre-tax margin of 8.6%.","Our total operating revenues, which were up 3.7% to $11.6 billion were a record for any quarter in American Airlines' history. This was also the seventh consecutive quarter in which we achieved positive unit revenue growth, with total revenue per ASM up 2.1%. Passenger revenues were up 3.1% to $10.7 billion, driven in part by a 1% improvement in yields.","Our cargo team continues to produce great results. In the second quarter, a 9.6% increase in volumes and a 8.9% increase in yields, drove a 19.4% increase in cargo revenues to $261 million. For the full year, we are forecasting revenue growth in the cargo business of 13%, and anticipate that cargo revenues will break the $1 billion mark for the first time in the company's history. Meanwhile, other revenues were up 8.1%, driven primarily by continued improvement in our loyalty program.","Total operating expenses were $10.6 billion, up 10.3%. The primary driver of this increase was consolidated fuel expense, which was $729 million or 40% higher year-over-year. As a result, consolidated cost per ASM was up 8.5% year over year. We continue to focus on our non-fuel cost performance during the quarter.","Our consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items was up 2.4% year-over-year, more than 1 point lower than the midpoint of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the quarter, driven by improved team member productivity, lower maintenance costs, and higher than anticipated airport rent settlement credits.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $7.2 billion in total available liquidity. During the quarter, we completed a number of transactions including paying off a $500 million unsecured note and repricing an extension of the $1.8 billion South American credit facility. The company also returned $396 million to shareholders in the form of a dividend payment of $46 million and by repurchasing 8.2 million shares at a cost of $350 million. In addition, the company made $158 million contribution to its defined benefit pension plans.","As we have discussed previously on calls, now that our fleet renewal program is winding down, we have begun to reduce our debt levels. Since the beginning of the year, our adjusted total debt, which includes our pension obligations has decreased by $1.3 billion, and we anticipate that it will continue to decline from this level each year.","We filed our investor update this morning, which includes our guidance for the remainder of the year. In that guidance, we updated our capacity plans and reduced our 2018 full-year forecast by 50 basis points. This reduction is driven by a 60 basis point reduction in the third quarter, with the fourth quarter 100 basis points lower than previous guidance. These changes are the result of our ongoing analysis of the impact of higher fuel on the profitability of our network, which has led to the elimination of underperforming flying in the second half of the year.","While we are still in the process of building our 2019 level of operations, we expect our capacity growth to be the lowest of any major carrier, and to be at or below GDP. This growth will be driven by gauge increases and a one-time opportunity to increase flying from our two most profitable hubs, with the additional gates in Dallas and Charlotte starting to come online next year.","We continue to examine our fleet plans with a view to better align our delivery stream with the needs of the airline, and our expectations for growth of our network. During the quarter, we reached an agreement to defer \u2013 with Airbus to defer delivery of 22 A321neos that were scheduled to arrive between 2019 and 2021. This change will reduce our overall aircraft CapEx by $1.2 billion over the next three years. We will now begin to take delivery of these aircraft in 2024.","We also announced a large regional jet order for 30 new aircraft to replace smaller regional jets. 29 of these will be delivered in 2019, with the last scheduled to be received in early 2020. As a result of these changes, we are revising our aircraft CapEx guidance. For 2018, we continue to expect aircraft CapEx of $1.9 billion, and we now expect our new aircraft CapEx for 2019 to be $2.9 billion, that's up slightly due to large regional jet order, offset by the A321 deferrals. 2020 aircraft CapEx will be reduced by $500 million to $1.2 billion and 2021 will be reduced by $400 million to $1 billion.","As we look at our year-to-date results, we are happy with our progress on the revenue and cost initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day last fall. However, given the higher fuel prices, we have to do more to get back on the path to grow margins. We have been driving forward on our One Airline initiative, a company-wide project to realize the benefits of the merger and create a more lean and efficient company. We have identified opportunities in a number of diverse areas to drive cost down throughout the business, including the insourcing of regional affiliate flying to our lower-cost wholly-owned regional partners, conducting health plan audits with a focus on lowering pharmaceutical expenses, reducing non-front-line management expenses we structure our organization for the future, and lower staffing requirements associated with the changes to our Basic Economy product. This project continues to identify new opportunities and we now expect $300 million of cost savings in 2018, and more than $1 billion over the next four years.","Due to the success of our One Airline project and the efficiencies we have been able to achieve during the year, we lowered our full-year CASM guidance this morning, even after the reduction in capacity I outlined earlier. We now anticipate that our unit cost growth rate excluding fuel and special items will be approximately 1.5% for 2018. It'll be approximately 1% in the third quarter and approximately flat in the fourth quarter. With the majority of our integration work complete, it is imperative that we continue this momentum to drive costs lower in our business.","Fuel continues to be higher on a year-over-year basis. Based on the forward curve as of July 18, we are forecasting a 30.4% increase in consolidated fuel expense in 2018, which will be an increase of $2.3 billion. For the full year, we now anticipate our fuel price to be between $2.18 to $2.23 per gallon.","We also guided to a third quarter 2018 TRASM increase of 1% to 3%, and Robert will provide more detail on that, and what we're seeing in the revenue environment. Taking this revenue and cost guidance together, we expect our third quarter of 2018 pre-tax margin excluding net special items to be between 5% and 7%, and our 2018 earnings per diluted share guide to be between $4.50 and $5 a share.","In conclusion, I would like to once again thank our entire team for doing their hard work. Our emphasis on managing cost in this business will continue with a focus on getting back to growing margins, which we believe will happen in 2019.","With that I will turn the call over to Robert.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Derek. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my remarks, I too would like to thank our team for their efforts in the quarter. They worked through some challenging weather conditions, which at times were really tough on the operation, and in addition we experienced a technology outage at one of our three wholly-owned regional carriers, PSA. The impact unfortunately resulted in the cancelation of approximately 3,000 flights the following week.","During the week, our team worked all hours of the day and night to rebook, refund, re-protect our customers, and they also worked tirelessly to recover crew member schedules and return the operation to normalcy. We can't thank our team enough for managing through the start of the summer and this event, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for inconveniencing them, especially during the summer travel season. Going forward, we're further hardening our systems and ensuring that our team is equipped to recover more quickly no matter what comes our way.","As both Doug and Derek mentioned in their remarks, persistently high fuel prices negatively impacted our second quarter results. We continue to be extremely confident in our long-term prospects and are committed to taking actions necessary to improve our short-term financial performance. Although we have delivered positive unit revenue growth for the last seven quarters and eight quarters in a row of outperformance versus the industry, the reality is that we must do more to offset higher fuel prices and grow earnings.","We are taking decisive action. As Derek mentioned in his remarks, we have moderated our future capacity plans, deferred aircraft deliveries, made further reductions to our planned capital expenditures, and lowered our cost outlook. These are necessary and beneficial steps to take in light of the current fuel price environment.","During the second quarter, we continued to make progress on the $2.9 billion of revenue and $1 billion of cost initiatives that we outlined at our Media and Investor Day last fall. As a reminder, as part of that plan, we said that we would take advantage of the power of our hubs and gateways, strengthen our domestic network, and grow where we have a competitive advantage. We are pleased with our progress on these network initiatives.","We continue to play to our strengths, which means growing at our hubs. Any new flight we add to these hubs grows connecting revenue opportunities exponentially. During the second quarter, we launched 43 new non-stop routes and seven new stations. We added new markets like Missoula, Montana out of our hubs in DFW and Chicago O'Hare, as well as Panama City Beach, Florida from our hubs in Charlotte and DFW.","In addition to creating new flight options for our customers, this growth brings high-margin, high-quality revenue on to our network. It also creates more connecting opportunities for our customers, facilitating new international destinations, like the addition of new seasonal service from DFW to Reykjavik, Philadelphia to Prague and Budapest, and between Chicago and Venice.","The early results from these recent changes are encouraging, as all of our domestic network adds to DFW have produced margins that are in excess of our system average. We grew ASMs at DFW by 4% during the second quarter and RASM grew even more at 4.4%.","As we look forward into 2019, we will continue to grow from our most profitable hubs with a primary focus on high quality growth from the 15 new gates at Dallas-Fort Worth and the seven new gates at our Charlotte hub, as well as the five new gates at Chicago O'Hare that opened earlier this year. We expect that some of that additional growth will be funded by moving less profitable flying from other parts of our network.","Our co-brand portfolio continues to see very strong acquisition growth year over year, with lower-than-expected attrition and continued growth in card spend. We are excited about the enhanced benefits we recently announced for our Citi\/AAdvantage Platinum Select card in May and the introduction of a new no fee co-brand card to our portfolio this month, the AAdvantage MileUp card. We expect that these additions to our portfolio to build on our already strong acquisition retention and card spend performance and ensure an AAdvantage co-brand card as the primary card for even more of our customers.","The corporate demand environment remains strong, as our sales initiatives continue to drive results. We ended June with another positive quarter with corporate revenue growth of 10% and continued improvement in our share gap. Forward performance remains positive. In addition, the sales team has built a healthy corporate pipeline, signing new agreements with key accounts, and our small to medium sized corporate acquisitions are at an all-time high.","We continue to see impressive results from our highly differentiated Premium Economy product, which is now installed on 87 wide-body aircraft. Premium Economy is now being sold on 67 routes at an average fare that continues to be double the coach cabin fare. We currently estimate that the Premium Economy retrofit program will be complete by the summer of 2019, and at that time we will have 124 aircraft with Premium Economy.","While we have been happy with the rollout of our Basic Economy product over the last year, we announced today that beginning September 5, American will remove the carry-on bag restriction that is currently part of our domestic and short-haul international Basic Economy fare rules. Basic Economy is working well in the markets where we offer it, and we continue to see more than 60% of our customers buy up to Main Cabin when offered a choice. But the carry-on bag restriction left us uncompetitive from a product attribute perspective in some markets, and total incremental revenue from Basic Economy has fallen short of our original expectations. Removing the bag restriction will make this product more competitive, allowing us to offer this low fare product to more customers.","Network wide Basic Economy remains central to our plans, and during the second quarter, we expanded it across the entire Atlantic network. Results in this region have been very encouraging, with strong conversion rates to our Main Cabin product in excess of 60%. And even more importantly, we are offering the product choice to over 80% of our coach customers.","Turning to revenue. Our second quarter revenue was up 3.7% year-over-year and was an all-time record for any quarter at $11.6 billion. Second quarter cargo revenue improved 19.4% year-over-year on both strong volume and yields, continuing the positive trend we've seen since the second half of 2016. Our other revenue was up 8.1%, driven by increased revenues in our loyalty program due to strong co-brand credit card acquisitions and cardholder spend driving higher mileage sales.","Overall, TRASM improved 2.1% year-over-year. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter with positive unit revenue growth. International was particularly strong, but every entity had positive unit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. Domestic unit revenue was up 0.3%, driven by a 1 point increase in load factor. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for the domestic entity, although we did see some drag due to the Basic Economy competitiveness issues during the quarter.","Atlantic unit revenue was up 6.2%, driven by strong yield performance due to premium cabin demand, Premium Economy and the introduction of Basic Economy during the quarter. Our Latin America performance was also strong with PRASM up 4.6%, with strength across the board, with the exception of Mexico pleasure markets. Pacific PRASM was up 3.6% year-over-year on the basis of improved premium cabin performance. Japan and Korea were our strongest markets year-over-year.","Looking forward, we see core airline revenue performance improving as demand for our product remains strong. However, we do have some unique headwinds that will affect American quarter to quarter. In particular, we expect softening in Brazil and Argentina to negatively impact third quarter unit revenue by approximately 0.5 point. In spite of a less favorable entity mix, we still expect our year-over-year TRASM to be up 1% to 3% in the third quarter with Atlantic and domestic improving, and Pacific similar to the second quarter. This will be our eighth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth.","And we remain bullish about the future because of the actions we will take to improve profitability. To address underperforming entities and drive overall yields, we are reducing our planned capacity growth, with reductions in China, Brazil, and across our network. We are also deferring aircraft, reducing our planned capital expenditures, and lowering our cost outlook. We will be completing the integration of our flight attendant workforce later this year, which will enable the unrestricted deployment of our fleet across the network. In addition, we still have the majority of our revenue initiatives that will come online through 2021 and more than $1 billion in cost saving initiatives over that same period, and this does not include the benefit from being able to re-deploy aircraft and to expand to our two largest and most profitable hubs in 2019 and beyond.","As we finish up the summer travel period, we continue to be encouraged by the economic environment and strength we see in passenger demand. While we remain focused on the long term, we will continue to make investments that grow revenue, drive efficiencies, and expect to be on the path to margin expansion in 2019.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and to begin our question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, can you just talk about the balance sheet in this environment? I know cyclically the economy is doing well here, but obviously, you guys have the most leverage of all your peers, and I think that's added some pressure for the equity holders. So, can you talk about the way you view the balance sheet going forward?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure. We think it's good for our equity holders, our capital structure strategy. But \u2013 look, as it relates to the debt, the first thing we always should note is we have much higher asset values, given our much younger fleet than our larger competitors. Just kind of desktop appraisals of our aircraft are around $30 billion. I think those other guys around $15 billion. So, there's a huge asset value. That doesn't explain it all. Our debt levels are more than just that asset value, but please don't ignore that piece.","But look, what we believe, and the other point worth making by the way is that we hold very large amounts of cash because \u2013 as protection for what seems like the reason people would suggest we should be less levered, that is, in the risk of something \u2013 for risk protection. So, we choose to, instead of having more equity, which is a lot more expensive than debt, we choose to have more debt than others. We think it's \u2013 we think it's exactly \u2013 it's a very prudent level. We're not concerned about the levels, particularly given the asset values. And we protect ourselves by holding a lot more cash than companies of our size generally do. And we think that's the right capital structure for our investors. It absolutely and \u2013 what leverage does, is when earnings decline, it has a bigger effect and those are more levered when earnings increase, we get more of the bump. That's not why we do it, but that certainly is one of the effects.","But what we really try and do is make sure that our total capital structure is right for American Airlines and for our investors. And we don't think delevering, and therefore, getting even more equity, which is much more expensive than the debt, makes sense for our investors.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate that insight. And then Robert, on your domestic PRASM, when we look across the industry, it does appear that some of your bigger competitors might be seeing some acceleration in revenue, so we're just wondering, what is the difference between American's network and maybe what some of your peers are seeing in the market? And I think you talked about some of the longer term actions you're making to correct that, but what are some levers you can pull even near term to help revenue accelerate?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay. This is Don. In the near term, we think the changes that we're making in Basic Economy are going to help us. It's going to make the product more competitive. It's going to allow us to offer the product to more customers, and we think that's going to help our yield performance.","In addition to that, some of the schedule changes that we're making and taking capacity out are going to help us in the domestic market as well. We still see a strong corporate strength, again our corporate revenue was up 10%, and that continues to be strong. As we went through the quarter, we saw improving yields in close-in build. And we expect, as we look forward, into the third quarter, that the domestic market is going to be better for us in the third quarter than in the second.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Doug, you talked a lot about emphasizing sort of cost control and positioning the airline for a higher fuel price environment. As you think about the time it's going to take to get back to targeted earnings levels, how quick of a ramp should we be expecting in terms of your ability to kind of get this repositioning and reacceleration on the cost side to get the earnings level right?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, David. Hard question to answer, so I'm going to punt for the most part, in terms of trying to give you when exactly we think we'll be back there. What we are happy to say is 2019 certainly feels, as we look forward, like it will be a better year than 2018, and that's nice progression back to the target, but I don't know for certain when we'll get there.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Is it fair to say that the inflection in pre-tax margin implied in the 4Q guide is a good sort of signal that we're coming at least to a turn on the pre-tax margin side?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Again, I don't know that we're going to be able to tell you what quarter even we think we're going to make the flip at this point. But, again, as we look at this just year by year, 2019 certainly feels a lot better than 2018, and that's where we are at this point.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. And then \u2013 and maybe just a quick follow-up question on the change in the Basic Economy and adding the bag fee there. Is that an attempt to maybe kind of charge more for the Basic Economy product or just to fill more basic seats? I'm just trying to make sure I understand what the intent of that change is from a marketing standpoint?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, David, we got to a point where we weren't competitive. We launched this product about a year ago. As Robert said, we've been very happy with the results, but while that's true, for prices to the customers who are the buyers of this, there's a big airline out there who doesn't charge for the carryon and there are now filters on things like your Google search that ask you if indeed you want to bring a carryon or not, and if you say yes, all of a sudden the American flights don't show up nearly as high as they did before because it adds $20 to our fare. Nothing wrong with that, that's accurate. But when you get yourself in a position in this business where price-sensitive customers find themselves with lower fares on truly competitive airlines like that, we have to take that under consideration. And that's what it is. We put this product out with a different model than others had done in the past, and we've gotten to the point where we think the right thing to do is to get in line with the competition.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks a lot for the added color. Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. First one, it's kind of a follow-up to the first question this morning. But you cite the trailing growth of revenue relative to the competition. You talk about entity mix, but also can see that some of it is domestic. So, my question is how much of the domestic weakness do you attribute to self-inflicted woes? And how much is reflective of United and Delta taking share from you? Because it is beginning to feel mostly like the latter, and if that's accurate, it's not clear to me that you're doing enough to stem the bleeding.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not sure how you come to the conclusion, maybe you can tell us as to why it feels like, it's a share shift because that's not what we see.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Again, I'm not sure I \u2013 look, what we believe is what we said. More difficult comps year-over-year, without a doubt. On a two-year basis, we're still up more than both of those airlines.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","But look, you're right. We acknowledge, we think we can do better. And we think the steps we're taking primarily as it relates to this Basic Economy product are the difference. But, yeah, there's nothing where \u2013 as Robert said, our corporate revenues are up 10%. We don't see share movement anywhere. I will tell you, I asked the team to go look at the fact that United has announced how much they're growing in and out of Chicago, and clearly us being a Chicago hub carrier has to have some impact, because it doesn't mean we become unprofitable. It just means that if you add capacity, if you add ASMs at a rate greater than demand in a route where there weren't before, you see \u2013 we have some impact on.","But the interesting result of that work was to show that the bulk of that flying out of Chicago, at least the ASMs are largely to Hawaii. And other than Hawaii growth, the growth rates in Chicago at least in American markets were lower than they were throughout the rest of the United States.","So, look \u2013 anyway, we don't view this as a share loss. What we view it as is, well again, other than this Basic Economy issue, where again people might have booked another carrier because they saw a lower fare on them than us. But it's much more about \u2013 it's much more about when capacity grows in excess of demand, you're going to see some pressures on revenues. We've offset most of that, but not all of it. And we think we're going to get back to outperforming as we move forward.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","I'll just add...","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","...just, one other item. As we kind of look through kind of opportunities in kind of the revenue management space, that really kind of affects us globally. We think there is an opportunity for us to do better in periods of really low demand or trough periods. And this applies really across the network, but it does apply to the domestic market as well, as we look at it.","Obviously, our objective here is not to maximize load factor, it's to maximize revenue. But in periods of really low demand, we think there's an opportunity for us to actually grow our load factor and maintain the overall yield portfolio we also have. That's through some adjustments we're going to be making in our forecasting, and also our kind of work process within the revenue management space. We also believe that during these time periods, there are some real channel-specific things that we can do as well. And so, we think this is really kind of the next evolution for us and next focus. We think there's a lot of leverage in this going forward, really across the entire business.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And ...","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Jamie, I'm sorry. There's one more thing...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Please.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","... I probably should have mentioned by now. If you look at where our growth has been over the last year at American, it's not been in our most profitable hubs. Indeed, we're building up LAX, which is the right thing to do. Long term strategic, it was some growth in Philadelphia in response to some competitive incursions there to make sure that we were competitive. But not in places like Dallas and Charlotte, and not in places like our strongest hubs, which some of our other competitors did. So, that'll also have an effect. But long and short of it was we're really comfortable with where we are in terms of our relative positioning and feel really good about the future.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well as a follow-up on that, Doug, and let me just push you a little bit tougher here, we all remember a time when United couldn't punch its way out of a paper bag, when they were the perennial last place member of the big three. And what I'm being asked right now from investors is whether American has now simply stepped into the shoes that United once occupied. Maybe that is simply the construct of the industry going forward. It's almost like three, five, seven, you're going to have one chronic outperformer, let's call that Delta, in fairness. You have the silver medalist, let's call it United, and then inevitably American brings up the rear. So, how do you push back on that? What structural component of the American story can you point to, other than just trying harder, which is all well and good and to be applauded, to convince us that you can get off the bronze medal podium, so to speak?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah. You're going to have to watch us going forward, I guess, Jamie, if that's what your view is. We vehemently disagree, and I think that would be an overreaction too. So anyway, our competitors are doing a nice job, and one of them in particular had a lot more upside for a lot of reasons than we did, but that doesn't mean that we think we're not \\ go do exactly what we plan to do, which would be the best airline in the world. So, anyway, I would encourage them to look a little longer term.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right. I appreciate you taking so much time for questions. Thanks, gentlemen.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, everybody. Good morning. I'm curious how you can speak so confidently about growing margins next year, given fuel is high and RASM is unknowable. Are you basically telling us right now that you think you can do better than the 1% to 2% CASM x guide?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We're on that CASM number. We do not \u2013 we're guiding that for the next two years staying in the 1% to 2% range. So, we have not changed that. We will go through the planning process. We haven't done that yet for next year and we'll update that when we go through that planning process, but there's no change to the 2019 or 2020 CASM guide at this point in time.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. And then, Doug, honestly I'm surprised to hear you continue to beat the drum on this balance sheet stuff around asset values because, with all due respect, it really only matters if you're mortgaging assets and that's not a scenario that any equity holder cares about. So, what about \u2013 I'll put this differently, what about the drag of interest expense it provides on your P&L, which gives you so much less margin for error on the RASM, CASM stuff? Doesn't that factor into the equation somehow?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","It all factors into the equation. At the end of the day you end up with a capital allocation strategy that we think optimizes the value of the firm, and what we believe is, of course that will result in higher interest expense. It also results in fewer shares outstanding and it results in therefore a mix of less equity, which is more expensive, and more debt, which is much less expensive.","So, we believe we have the right mix, particularly given what happens in terms of our cost to the extent you went in the other direction. It doesn't, in this business, doesn't tend to reduce our borrowing cost, particularly because we're borrowing against really strong assets. So, we're hard pressed to come to the conclusion that delevering from where we are today, and particularly with the cash balance we hold, makes sense for our investors.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Susan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes. Good morning, everyone. So, just a question on operational performance. Even before the PSA issues, your on-time baggage, et cetera has lagged and customer service complaints have been pretty high. I'm just wondering, United's been pretty vocal with Core4 trading, et cetera, can you just talk a little bit about what you're doing to address your operational issue?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure. I'll chime in here. Performance the last couple of months hasn't been where we've wanted it. We can point to some things. Certainly the PSA outage was one item. We've also had some pretty tough weather year-over-year out of Miami, which has impacted the system. But we see a lot of opportunity going forward, though. And certainly getting the airline fully integrated is going to be a big deal to us. We're making good progress on the path to getting our flight attendants integrated, and we're also hopeful that we'll have our fleet and mechanics fully integrated as we look forward as well.","The kind of things that you look to improve upon is certainly aircraft reliability. And we're dedicating a lot of effort to making sure that as we move toward some of the older fleets, the 767s and the Super 80s, as they move out of the fleet, that they get the attention that they deserve. Our folks are working really hard. We've got a game plan to get back really to being where we expect to be, which is best at departing on time, and completing flights, and ensuring that bags are delivered too.","Couple points I'd like to note, though. First off, I do know that in terms of servicing customers as far as missed connections, I know that we're doing a nice job there as we've seen missed connections drop year-over-year. We've seen complaints drop certainly from a DOT perspective. And then, also our internal measures in terms of compliments and complaints ratios have improved as well.","No doubt, we've got some work to do. We're in the middle of the summer, our team's working hard, and we know we'll get back on path.","Susan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the expansion at DFW and Charlotte. Just around the timing and just how you expect that to flow through maybe the cost and the revenue lines, as those kind of come on? Because it seems like maybe your commentary on the DFW performance means that we should see some good incremental revenue contribution from those.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","As far as the gates go, we anticipate that we'll start getting those online late in the first quarter, early second quarter in Dallas-Fort Worth. And then we'll ramp up from there, the 15 gates.","In Charlotte, the seven gates really they start coming online at the end of the year \u2013 more towards the end of the year, and I think that we'll have four or so gates ready in the third quarter and fourth quarter and the remainder of those in 2019. And what we intend to do is that we have a nice opportunity to ensure first that any growth that we do is positioned there, but as well there's opportunity for redeployment from underperforming places within our network. And we're going through that process, and you'll see a lot of movement on that and announcements on that forthcoming in the months to come in 2018.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, the benefits of that really may be second half 2019, is that fair?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's fair, Savi.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then if I might just follow up on the domestic, 3Q, how much of that benefits from kind of the look back with the hurricane impact last year? So, ex-hurricane impact, are you kind of expecting maybe domestic RASM to be down year-over-year?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","No. This is Don Casey. No, we ended up with a benefit related to Hurricane Harvey. We had a negative impact associated with Maria and Irma, and net-net all of the hurricanes last year had about a three-tenths benefit to us. So even outside of the hurricane effect, we see unit revenue domestic improving from the second quarter.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Doug, when you and the board consider what the appropriate organizational structure is for the company, and I'm talking about the airline versus the loyalty program, how do you have that conversation and make the decision without knowing how a third-party would value your loyalty program? Isn't that just good due diligence to understand how the market would value that business?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well anyway, Joseph, I'll answer the question this way. We do indeed have a loyalty program that we think is the best in the world and that is real value. We think that value accrues to American Airlines, and therefore to American Airlines shareholders. And if we were to separate it, we worry about the ability to retain that value because...","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Doug, you realize there's an option here where you don't have to separate it. You can just monetize a minority stake to prove to the market what it's worth. That is an option, right?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Joseph, to answer your basic \u2013 on your first question, as to whether we look at this, the answer is yes. We have indeed looked at it, and we'll continue to look at it. With our shareholders' interest at heart, what I'm telling you is we've done that analysis and that due diligence. To this point, we've not decided that's in the best interest of our shareholders.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. The guidance for the full year implies a margin of about 8%. If I back out the marketing fees you guys get from the card partners, it's closer to 3% to 4%. Do you think that if the two businesses were internally viewed separately and forced to stand on their own, that you would be able to manage the airline side to a better margin than what seems to be pretty low for the largest airline in the world?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","We don't. And furthermore, we think it's hard to separate those businesses. They're so intricately related indeed. What the card is, Joseph, is another distribution channel. It's a way in which people purchase tickets on American Airlines. And it's a valuable distribution channel, but that's what it is. And if we separate that out of the airline, I don't think those margins can be separated or should be because I don't believe as you do so. They remain the same.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, gentlemen.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Doug, just a high-level question for you. As far as giving earnings guidance for the full year, do you think maybe that wasn't the right decision, given that it's tough to predict, movement in fuel, the lag between fuel and fares, et cetera? I would just love your thoughts there.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. We went down this road reluctantly. We at American for quite some time have been suggesting that earnings targets and things like that were, one, hard to do in this business because of the volatility of things like fuel, and two, led to short-term mentality that we didn't think was healthy.","So, having said that, as others did it and as investors, at least the analyst community continued to suggest to us that that was important to our investors. We acquiesced and we're there now. We're not intending to change it at least for this year, I guess, because we worry that doing so, particularly as we were pulling it down, would look like we just didn't want to tell you what we thought it was, but it's certainly not the case.","But look, I thought the memo from Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett was right on point. I believe that we as business do \u2013 our shareholders and the people we employ, the people we serve a disservice by focusing too much on the near term. And that doesn't mean you definitely do that if indeed you get focused on quarterly earnings, but you can, so there's a possibility it happens, and it's just something -like I said, we went into it reluctantly. You're intelligent to note it. Anyway, we are where we are. We'll continue to do it. We'll continue to look at whether it makes sense for us, but I don't think it helps us make right decisions. I don't think it helps us make the best decisions for our shareholders. To the extent we still make the best decisions for our shareholders and it's of use to our investors, that's something we'll continue to do.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Doug. And on the capacity adjustments, you guys are obviously being pretty aggressive, I think more so versus your peers. How do you get comfortable with the fact that those capacity adjustments will stick given that others aren't necessarily playing along and may just backfill some of the growth that you cut?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","It's a competitive marketplace. We think that we're sizing the airline that's right for American, American's network, and American's customers. And as we take a look forward, we really like the opportunity that we have in front of us in DFW and Charlotte and the opportunities that we have there. So, we're keeping an eye on it. Certainly our market position in our hubs is important, and we have to offer a network that is attractive to our customers and we'll make sure that we continue to do that.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And just to be clear, to the extent we are reducing any existing flying, we're still growing somewhat, and the routes that we're reducing, we're reducing because they're not profitable at these levels of fuel price. That means what we call utilization flying. That is flying where aircraft are otherwise sitting due to our hub-and-spoke structure, and we can fly them somewhere and back \u2013 and get them back into the hub, and you just have the variable cost of that route. But that variable cost is largely fuel. So, if you can't cover the cost, that doesn't make sense to fly. That's not something anyone will backfill, as you say.","And it's other routes that just, again, in these times don't make sense for us, and that's flying in and out of our hubs. So, no real concern on our part that someone will come into flying that we would reduce. And as Robert said correctly, we got to manage our capacity based on what we think is best for American.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hello, Helane.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Oh, thanks. Hi, guys. Thanks very much for getting me in. So, here is my question, and it has more to do with technology. When you look at what happened to PSA, is that something that was avoidable? And if not, is there something you can do that would enable you to avoid issues like that going forward?","Maya Leibman - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi, Helane, this is Maya. What I would say is, I'd love to tell you that technology is bulletproof and that every issue is avoidable, but unfortunately that's not the case. And in this particular incident, we had an unusual issue, where we had both primary and redundant servers that were designed to take the load should one server fail. But in this case, because of the nature of the issue and because of how unusual it was, it took down both our primary and redundant servers.","I think that there's a lot that we do and that all airlines do that everyone in my position does to ensure that we are doing the utmost to prevent any outages. And I think we have a comprehensive program around disaster recovery, around high availability and redundancy, and that's our objective. The problem is that technology isn't always quite as bulletproof as we'd like it to be. And in the airline industry, issues are very immediately apparent to the entire public, and they're very negatively impactful.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thank you, Maya, I appreciate that response. And then, just a quick question on the decision to adjust CapEx, I guess. Should we just think about it as two independent airlines made aircraft decisions based on their independence, and they came together and they have to adjust capacity growth or plans? Or should we think about it as a cash flow issue?","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","I view it as one airline making a capacity decision. We have the ability to do and have more large RJs and we were able to negotiate a deal with Embraer and Bombardier to bring in those aircraft earlier. The push of the A321s is more of a, we have the capacity already, we have aircraft that we can keep around, we're putting 737s through the Oasis Project and modifying those aircraft, so there really wasn't the need to take on new aircraft at this point in time, which enabled us to push them out till 2024. So, it's really looking at the delivery stream and making sure that you're not \u2013 you don't want to replace aircraft too early when other aircraft are fine and can be flown in the markets that we have. So, that was just more of a decision from a CapEx standpoint to push those out just from a need perspective on the narrow-body aircraft.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And, Helane, it's Doug. Thanks for asking, that's a good distinction. We have in the past talked about deferral of aircraft and told you that we did put together two fleet types and we looked at it, we had too many aircraft coming when you had enough. At certain times we were able to defer some. This one, as Derek just said, is not that. We had already done most of that \u2013 I think all of that work actually. This is the result of given the existing environment making sure that we actually wanted to take airplanes in those times and we come to the conclusion we don't.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thank you so much, team. I appreciate the response.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Dan.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Oh, hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. JVs LATAM, Aer Lingus and Qantas, big picture, what does the roadmap look like from here for approval to implementation? Is the expectation that these could be implemented sometime next year? And then what is the revenue pie that you're going to be trying to optimize with these partners?","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, let me talk about the \u2013 this is Steve Johnson by the way. Let me talk about the implementation, and Don can talk about the revenue.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","The timing, he asked about.","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","That's what I meant. I think there remains a chance that we can get Qantas approved this year. We're working very closely with the DOT there. They're taking really a fresh and I think very thoughtful look at the whole concept of antitrust immunity around JBs, and Qantas is turning out to be the platform for that. So, it has taken a little longer than we had hoped, but we remain optimistic that it's going to get done, and we remain hopeful that we can get it done, get the approval in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter.","Aer Lingus is \u2013 should, I think we all thought that Aer Lingus would be a straightforward application, but the DOT again is taking a different look at Aer Lingus, primarily around the idea about putting a low-cost, low-fare carrier into a joint business. Their view, that's not been done before, and they want to make sure that that's going to deliver the consumer benefits that we promise. So, that's going to take a little bit more time. And my guess is that Aer Lingus is probably going to be an early 2019 decision by the DOT, so implementation after that.","LATAM is \u2013 we're still waiting to hear from the Chilean competition tribunal that's reviewing that, and once we've heard from them, we're actually going to file a new application in LATAM because our application now is more than two years old and we want to update that and use the learnings that we've had in Qantas and Aer Lingus to supplement that application. That's certainly going to be acted on by the DOT some time in probably the second half of 2019, I would've thought.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","And in terms of potential benefit, look, we're able to offer more choice for our customers and a joint business relationship ensures that we're able to sell on each other's networks, and really give customers the opportunity for the best of what the joint business partners have to offer. And so we look forward to that as these approvals come.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I see. Okay. $2.9 billion in revenue initiatives. What have you captured so far? What is the updated dollar goal for 2019? And what potential exists to accelerate some of these benefits?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","What I'd tell you is that we're certainly down the path and out of the first year. I think what we had said, we're about $0.5 billion...","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","For the first half of the year.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","First half of the year about $0.5 billion through. There's obviously a little bit of a setback because of Basic Economy, but with the change to the program, we think that we will be able to recapture some of what had fallen off.","In addition to that, though, we know that there are other opportunities that will more than make up for whatever's been lost with Basic Economy. So, if we take a look at, from Investor Day last fall, with where we stand today and what we're adding to it, we think that we're on track. And Derek, can say a little bit more.","Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And Dan, what we presented was $1.35 billion in 2018 for the revenue synergies and $775 million in 2019. I think there's about a shift of about $200 million, so the 2018 will be down to about $1 billion \u2013 $1.1 billion $1.5 billion, but that $200 million is going to go into 2019, so we're up to $975 million in 2019. So, the way to look at it is we're a little bit behind due to some of the Basic Economy stuff that we talked about. But that shift is going to go into 2019, that $200 million, as we stay on target for the $2.9 billion.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the analyst portion of today's question-and-answer session. We would now like to open the call to media questions. Our first media question comes from Andrew Tangel with Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Hey. Wanted to ask about fuel costs and fares and theirs and you all's ability to pass this along to customers. How much are fares are going up? How much more sort of longer term are you all going to be able to pass along these fuel costs that are here to stay to customers? At what point do fare increases dampen demand and wind up preventing you all from growing revenue? So, what's the limit of you all's ability to raise fares, recoup these fuel costs as consumers are facing higher costs on other products too?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, I'll just start and others can add in. It's a competitive marketplace and at the end of the day it's all about supply and demand. And where we stand today, we see a strong demand for the product, and so we're optimistic that there's the chance to recover some of the cost of the increase in the price of fuel. But over the long run, it depends on the economy and it depends on how much supply is out in the marketplace, and that supply is seats. So, what we see though is, in our markets, we see a prudent deployment of capacity, and we've seen signs of recovery, and as we stated, we've seen successive quarters of year-over-year revenue improvement, and we expect to see that as we head into the rest of 2018 and into 2019 as well. Don?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Again, we're also diversifying some of our sources of revenue as well through growing our credit card business and our ancillary revenue stream, all of which will help us grow the top line.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","And as a follow-up on the issue with Taiwan and in references to Taiwan on your website and other ways that Chinese government has now been focused on. Can you walk us through your all's decision in addressing the Chinese demands the way you all did and what are you looking for from the U.S. government now, as China reportedly has said that American Airlines or U.S. airlines response to their demands has been incomplete?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yeah, look, I'd prefer not to do that, if it's okay by you. I'll give you the blow by blow of this. What I'll tell you is we had a deadline. We complied within the deadline with what we thought was a nice solution for everyone, and hopefully, that'll be the case. That's where we stand right now.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Can I ask, just generally speaking then, why you all are uncomfortable with addressing sort of the decision-making process and your thoughts on doing what you all did, at least in terms of international affairs? But earlier you all have weighed in on domestic affairs, at least regarding the migrant children transport. Is this just trickier for some reason? Can you at least address why you won't address the decision-making process?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Sure. Yes, it's a matter of international affairs that is I think more important to those countries than to American Airlines, and we don't want to intervene in that process.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Your line is open.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Hi. Good morning. Don, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about Basic Economy, and what you were seeing that made you decide you needed to make a change. Like were you just not able to sell the fares at all, were you having to really deeply discount them, and sort of when you realized that you did have a big problem?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","That was to you, Don.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Okay. Hey, yeah. First of all, I wouldn't describe it as a big problem. This was really an issue of competitiveness, right? We've been kind of watching it now since we rolled the product out. The industry hasn't aligned on product attributes, and we think kind of shifting this direction is going to allow us to offer this choice to more customers and that's going to lead to a better revenue outcome for us.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. But can you comment on what made you realize that there was an issue caused by not being aligned with the others? Was it that you weren't selling Basic Economy or what?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","We weren't giving as many customers the choice for buying Basic Economy under our current product configuration and by changing the attributes, we're going to be able to offer this product to more customers.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","So, that sounds to me like you weren't selling as much as you wanted to.","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Yes. The scope wasn't as large as we had originally anticipated, and we think this is going to increase the scope of coverage of the product.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. And can you give us an idea of how far it lagged, what you had anticipated?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","No. I think all we'll say is that from where we are right now we expect the results to improve in excess of $100 million a year.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And look Mary, I'll just point out because it's not obvious I mean this is good news for customers. Again, we're amending the product to be more customer friendly and allowing customers to purchase that product to carry on a bag without having to pay for it, but still having constraints on the product that some of our customers will choose to not want to purchase that product, but purchase a different product.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. Thank you.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Thanks, Mary.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Your line is open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi, David.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Hi. Good morning. Well, Mary really asked my question, but let me then jump to something else. Robert, did you say during the analyst section that the reduction in 3Q and 4Q capacity growth will include China and Brazil? And if I heard that correctly, is that in any sense because you're worried about the trade dispute or rising tariffs cutting into either of those areas?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","David, as a matter of fact these are changes that we've announced previously and it's due to ultimately the profitability that we had seen and certainly as we forecast with higher oil prices. It's due solely to that.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay. All right. Thanks very much.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is open.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Hi, Leslie.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just another one on Basic Economy. What's the upsell? I think you guys had something like 50% of passengers that were considering Basic and then ended up getting the regular economy? And how do you expect that to change with the baggage allowance?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","Our current upsell rate is 63%, and we expect as we change the product attribute with carry-on bag that that's going to go down a little bit to around 50%, but the number of customers that we'll be upselling is going to go up.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","The number of customers that you're upselling will go up, but...","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","There are going to be more customers that are going to be presented with a choice.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","The product will be available in a lot more places, Leslie.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Oh, so it's a screening issue on Kayak and others. Okay. Got it. And then, Doug, you had previously said this year that fares are too low for oil prices this high. How has that changed? Are fares okay now or how much do you expect or need them to go up to deal with these higher fuel costs?","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Well, okay. I should say it this way. Our revenues aren't up as much as our fuel costs are up. So, to maintain earnings we would need to see \u2013 to maintain earnings at parallels we need to see revenues get more in line with the fuel cost increase. So, anyway, what really needs to happen I think, Leslie, is over time capacity adjusts to a level, where it's more in line with demand growth and more in line with the reality of existing fuel prices. I expect that'll happen over time. It'll be gradual. I don't think it's \u2013 certainly there are amazing values out there for customers, for consumers right now that \u2013 all throughout the fare level spectrum, and that'll continue to the extent they go up. It doesn't require a large material increase. But absolutely, when our costs or production goes up, we need to get to a point where we can raise the cost, raise our revenues to a level to cover that cost.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Okay. Got it. And then the LATAM JV, will that help you at all with some of the headwinds that you're seeing in Latin America, Brazil, and then some of the political stuff?","Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.","It will once it's implemented. Obviously, we're a ways from getting it implemented, but once it's implemented we think it's going to help us \u2013 have a material benefit for both us and LATAM, as we're able to offer a much, much broader network and much greater choice to customers.","Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And this is Steve. Not just LATAM, but Qantas and Aer Lingus, and the JVs that our competitors are applying for \u2013 they provide really fantastic benefits for travelers and our customers, and we look forward to being able to offer that as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patti Waldmeir with Financial Times. Your line is open.","Patti Waldmeir - Financial Times","All of my very efficient colleagues have asked all my questions. Thanks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you. If you think of anything, call us back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Russell with FlightGlobal. Your line is open.","Edward Russell - FlightGlobal","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious, when you talk about shifting capacity away from less profitable hubs, less profitable markets, what markets or what hubs do you expect are going to be impacted by that shift? Where could we expect to see some cuts?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Here's what I'd tell you. Well, first off, we've been really successful. As I said in my opening comments, we grew DFW by 4% in terms of ASMs and we're able to outpace that with unit revenue growth. And we see our opportunities to be in Charlotte and DFW and filling out the gates in Chicago. We have growth plan for next year, as Derek has said, but it's more or less going to be GDP or lower. And we think that the gates that we have are going to be more than capable of absorbing that.","Edward Russell - FlightGlobal","Okay.","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","And as we take a look at your redeployment opportunities, it really is, as Doug had said, there's utilization opportunities that we're doing now, that maybe we will cut back on. And then, in terms of around the edges, maybe some aircraft in certain parts of the network are better used certainly in those new gates. And so, it won't have a material impact on the hubs outside of DFW and Charlotte and Chicago.","Edward Russell - FlightGlobal","Okay. So, minimal cuts at hubs like Phoenix or Philadelphia or","Miami or those places, is what you're saying?","Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Yes.","Edward Russell - FlightGlobal","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like turn the call back over to Doug Parker for closing remarks.","William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.","Okay. My closing remarks is, thanks for your interest.

Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Dan Cravens. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Cravens","Thank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our question-and-answer session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications, Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management; as well as Vasu Raja, our Senior Vice President of Network Strategy.","Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Robert will then following with commentary on operational performance and our commercial activities for our 2019 and 2020. Derek will then walk us through the details on the third quarter and provide us some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year and some preliminary guidance for 2020. And then after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans, and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected.","Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website, the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thanks Dan, good morning everybody and thanks for joining us.","Today we announced pre-tax earnings excluding special items of $835 million or $1.42 per share, that\u2019s a 16% increase in year-over-year pre-tax earnings and a 20% increase in EPS. But we know these earnings and the increase in earnings should have been even better.","Our third quarter results reflect two major challenges that impacted our business. First, 737 MAX fleet remaining grounded throughout quarter of course negatively impacting our pre-tax earnings by an estimated $140 million in this quarter alone. Second, we had significant operational challenges in American, in the first half of the quarter as we continue to work on negotiating an industry-leading contract we [want] [ph] for our TWU and IAM teams.","As it relates to the 737 MAX that situation is of course ongoing. We have two goals for the MAX. First, of course is for Boeing to complete the FAA\u2019s required recertification process and ensure the aircraft is safely flying again. Second, is to ensure that American is compensated for the loss revenue that the MAX grounding has caused. We missed deadlines and extended grounding for our customers, our team members, and our shareholders. So we're working to ensure that Boeing shareholders bear the cost of Boeing failures not American Airlines shareholders.","Turning now to our second main challenge TWU-IAM contract. We've seen significant improvements in our operational reliability as our negotiations are resumed. We've been remediated talks through the National Mediation Board since early September, those are our first talks since April. And both parties are agreed not to discuss the content of those talks publicly at the request of NMB but you should know that we're very focused on reaching an agreement, which is fair to all involved and ensures our operations back on track.","Now, we recognize that beyond these two factors the status quo is not an option. We're committed to urgently improving performance and enhancing shareholder value. We want to talk about building the trust of our stakeholders and creating value for the long-term. We also appreciate in many respects, the long-term map. We know we need to do better and we will.","As we knew at the end of 2019, we're committing to deliver on three key areas will create value for our shareholders in 2020, operational excellence, efficient and profitable growth, and significant free cash flow generation.","I'll talk a bit about each of those. First and foremost, we must restore American\u2019s operational reliability to the standards of excellence that our customers and our team members deserve. Importantly, we believe the issues that impacted our operations for much of the summer are now behind us. We had an excellent September, and that performance has continued into October.","Too months don\u2019t make a trend, we won't rely entirely on our recent performance, or our forward confidence. As Robert will discuss in more detail, we're executing on specific plans to improve our operating reliability beyond reaching a labor agreement and specific goals that we will meet. We simply will not allow our customers and team members to experience another period like this past summer again.","Second, we're going to grow American's network in 2020 by approximately 5% through efficient and profitable growth. We anticipate much of this growth will be at or above system average unit revenues because it's driven by gates we've been able to acquire in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Charlotte. These are two of our highest margin hubs. And as we've already experienced in DFW this year, routes that are added into these large connecting hub operations immediately produce [yearly] [ph] revenues in excess of our system-wide average and it will be efficient growth.","For example, [many of the cost] [ph] of our 737 MAX aircraft are already in our cost structure. Our operational reliability improvements will also drive some of the growth and these improvements, increase flying and reduce costs. Combining those factors with our previously announced cost initiatives give us confidence that our above average RASM growth will be added at below average incremental unit costs. Derek will provide some high level CASM estimates in his remarks and will provide more specific details on the fourth quarter call once we complete our budgeting process. But just now we're excited about our prospects to grow and to grow efficiently and profitably in 2020.","Lastly and importantly, we are confident we will begin to produce significant free cash flow for our investors in 2020 and beyond. Much of that confidence is driven by the earnings improvement we expect from the first two [indiscernible] discussed, and we expect those initiatives to improve profitability over where it would be otherwise.","But at the same time that's happening, we are reaching the end of an unprecedented program to invest capital into American Airlines. The $30 billion in investments we've made over the past six years have been necessary to integrate and upgrade two airlines that had suffered a lack of investment, and most importantly, to modernize an aging fleet. That work is now done and we anticipate our CapEx requirements will fall from the over $5 billion per year for the past six years to $3.7 billion in 2020, $2.1 billion in 2021, and should average approximately $3 billion thereafter.","What that means for our investors, is if our estimated 2019 earnings are unchanged in both 2020 and 2021 -- in both 2020 and 2021 and this is not an earnings forecast, just an earnings constant analysis, then our free cash flow would be approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 and $3 billion in 2021. That's $5.5 billion in free cash flow in just two years at a company that has a current market capitalization of approximately $12.5 billion or a 44% free cash flow yield over just two years. And again, that's on constant 2019 earnings. None of us will be pleased with constant 2019 earnings into 2020 and 2021.","So as we said in the past, as we generate that significant free cash flow, we will naturally delever our balance sheet. We will repay debt as it becomes due and the need to raise new debt against new aircraft will now be much lower. We anticipate debt requirement and adjusted debt will be significant. We expect adjusted net debt will fall by approximately $3 billion to $4 billion in the next two years and by $8 billion to $10 billion over the next five years.","And we will of course, continue to return cash in excess of our needs to our shareholders, ensuring a period of significant free cash flow generation will facilitate that initiative.","So in summary, we're pleased the two large issues that have impacted our performance should be addressed as we enter 2020. We are not of the view that correcting those two items alone are sufficient for our customers, our team members, or our shareholders. As it relates to our shareholders, for example, we know we have a profitability margin gap versus our largest competitor and we're committed to narrow that gap in 2020 and beyond. We're excited about our prospects for the future, and are grateful to the 130,000 hardworking team members of American Airlines, and the amazingly great work they do every day to take care of our customers.","With that, I will turn it over to Robert Isom.","Robert Isom","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone.","Before I begin, I will add my thanks to our team members for doing a great job of taking care of millions of customers during the busy summer travel period. Their hard work was instrumental in our ability to generate record revenue in the third quarter and grow margins despite the challenges that Doug highlighted. Importantly, we continue to execute on a number of initiatives to improve the trajectory of our business going forward.","As we look at our business, the economy is strong, and our demand for our product remains robust. And we look forward to a strong holiday season.","We reported another quarterly record, with third quarter revenue of $11.9 billion, 3% higher than the third quarter of 2018. This also marks the 12th consecutive quarter of unit revenue growth and we expect to produce our 13th next quarter. Derek will talk more about the revenue environment in his remarks.","Global sales and distribution continue to win in the marketplace. During the quarter corporate revenue outpaced system revenue growth on healthy corporate demand, a great result given our operational challenges.","As we look at our operations, we have already seen a significant improvement in our operating reliability. Since June, we have seen consistent month-over-month improvement. And for the full third quarter, our on-time metrics improved in both our mainline and regional operations. In fact, our September on-time arrival performance or A14 was the seventh best month in American\u2019s history, and our best A14 performance since November of 2017. As Doug mentioned, this improvement continues into October.","We continue to strengthen our operations with ongoing enhancements, including retiring older aircraft, simplifying our fleet and schedule, and fortified our maintenance and airport resources. Our underlying execution is solid and we are committed to returning American to a position of operational excellence. And as a result, we expect our 2020 completion factor to increase by one to two percentage points and to see a significant improvements in all reliability metrics, including on-time performance, baggage handling, and customer satisfaction.","We know we can't allow our customers and our team members to experience another period like this past summer ever again. So if for some unforeseen event in 2020 lead us to question our ability to meet our reliability standards, we will reduce our schedule rather than let our operations become the buffer. We don't believe that will be required of course. We also know it's a commitment we need to make to ensure that we restore operational excellence.","Now with perspective the MAX, we have extended to cancel our cancellations through January 15. We continue to work closely with FAA and Boeing to have built flexibility into that date. Regardless of when the aircraft is recertified, we plan to be prudent as we reintroduce the Max back into our network. Before it begin commercial service, we will continue our collaboration with the APA and APSA accomplish training and conduct multiple flights with our pilots, flight crews, executives, and other team members to make sure that we are all comfortable that the aircraft is ready for our customers. And only then will we gradually place the aircraft back into our schedule.","As part of our faced approach to reintroducing the 24 MAX aircraft that we have in storage today, we'll begin with five aircraft flying in the first two weeks, that's 22 departures per day. Two weeks later we'll add 12 more aircraft. The remaining seven will be faked into service two weeks after that and we'll add additional MAX aircraft as they become available. And note by year end 2020, we have planned to take delivery of an additional 26 MAX aircraft for a total of 50 in our fleet. While 10 of those 26 aircraft had been built we don't know exactly when they'll be delivered or when the remainder will be built.","Restoration of operating reliability will drive customer satisfaction, but there is much, much more that we're doing to make the journey more efficient, easier, and more enjoyable for our customers.","In fact, here are several enhancements that launched in the third quarter, which demonstrate a steady and consistent focus on improving the customer experience. First off, we put - we've added rich digital content, which has helped drive a 25% year-on-year improvement in premium economy ticket sales on aal.com. We created unique opportunities for our customers to upsell into the premium cabin, thereby significantly growing ancillary revenue and approved system that makes it easier for families to secure seats together has been added. And we've recently launched board notification to reduce the wait time at the gate for customers. And we're speeding customers\u2019 boarding through biometrics, biometrics boarding at DFW for international departures.","And when there are disruptions, we've added the ability for customers to change flights and receive compensation before traveling to the airport. And we've automated hotel, meal, and transportation vouchers delivered electronically to customers during disruption.","The steady stream of customer-focused deliveries provide better experience for our customers, for our team members, and certainly better results for our shareholders. We have a pipeline of additional customer friendly features that we expect to launch in 2020.","The foundation of customer preference begins with our network. We continue to be extremely excited after seeing the results from our network expansion plans with growth targeted our most profitable hubs. This effort began in May, where we added 100 daily departures out of our DFW hub. With nearly two full quarters under our belt the results have exceeded our initial expectations.","During the third quarter, we grew domestic capacity at DFW by 9% to produce fragile growth at the hub of 3.5%. This is the largest capacity expansion at any hub in the United States in more than a decade. It sets the stage for additional plant expansion next year in Charlotte and at Reagan National in 2021.","On the partnership side late in the quarter, while Tom notified us of their intention to leave the OneWorld Alliance and a formal relationship with Delta. Well, that's disappointing, but not surprising given the regulatory challenge our proposed joint venture fate. Our vast South American network will ensure that we recaptured the majority of the potential coacher revenue on our own aircraft, and that's already proven to be the case. There has been no revenue impact since the announcement. American remains the largest U.S. carrier to Latin and South America, and we were committed to providing the best service to the region for our customers.","Recently, we announced additional frequencies between Miami and Lima, Sao Paulo, and Santiago. And we're confident that with the strength of our network, we'll track other partners to -- in the region.","In the Pacific, we are moving quickly to realize the opportunities provided by our new joint business agreement with Qantas. It was approved by DOJ in July. This agreement allows for commercial integration between American and Qantas delivering new routes, and ultimately significant customer benefits, including more seamless integration with traveling on the American and Qantas networks.","So in conclusion, we have a great foundation built and our core business is strong. We made investments to improve the product; our fleet renewal is -- program is nearing completion. And we continue to refine our network to add margin accretive growth. We're confident that will deliver improve results in 2020 and beyond to benefit our shareholders, our customers and team members.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.","Derek Kerr","Thanks, Robert and good morning, everyone.","During the quarter we were able to grow both pre-tax margin and earnings per share for the second successive quarter. Our third quarter results came in towards the high-end of the guidance range we provided in July. For the third quarter, our pre-tax profit excluding net special items was $835 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin excluding special items of 7% compared to 6.2% in 2018.","Our third quarter 2019, pre-tax net profit excluding net special items was $630 million; a 15% increase over the third quarter of 2018. And our diluted earnings per share excluding net special items in the third quarter was $1.42 per share, up 20% from $1.19 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. As Robert mentioned, the revenue environment remains strong with third quarter top-line growth of 3%.","Passenger revenues grew by 4.1% to $11 billion a record for the third quarter.","LATAM was the best performing entity during the third quarter with year-over-year unit revenue improvement of 5.9%. Brazil and Mexico led the way with double-digit improvements in yield, while we improved load factor in the entity overall by 6.5 points.","Pacific unit revenue also continues to show improvement aided by our China restructuring last year with unit revenue up 1.6%. Specifically Japan and Australia were up year-over-year, while we faced challenges in Hong Kong and Korea.","Atlantic unit revenue declined by 4.6%. This decline was driven by transfer payments related to our joint business agreement of about 2.3 points and currency effect of about 1 point. International point-of-sale remains challenging but we successfully shifted to North American point-of-sale and grew load factor by 3.2 points.","Domestically, we saw and continue to see broad-based strength with unit revenue growth of 4% and improved unit revenue across every hub. We continue to see weakness in our cargo business, weaker demand due to trade concerns across the system drove cargo yields lower by 4% for the quarter. When combined with year-over-year international schedule reductions, the result was cargo revenues fell 19.9% to $208 million.","Total operating expense in the third quarter were up 2.1% at $11.1 billion. When fuel and special items were excluded, our unit costs increased in the third quarter by 4.8% compared to 2018 due primarily to higher salaries and benefits, maintenance and regional expense, and lower than planned capacity.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $8 billion in total available liquidity well above our target liquidity balance of $7 billion. During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $44 million and repurchased $200 million of stock or 7.3 million shares. As Doug talked about, we have begun to delever the balance sheet as our CapEx requirements have reduced this year.","We expect our adjusted debt position including pensions to decrease by $1.5 billion this year.","On October 10, we announced we had removed the 737 MAX from our schedules through January 15, 2020. We now expect the 737 MAX grounding will have a negative full-year 2019 pre-tax income impact of approximately $540 million based primarily on loss revenue from scheduled reductions.","Now that we have removed the MAX from 2019, we expect capacity growth of approximately 2.7% for the fourth quarter and 1% for the full-year. This is less than half the full-year capacity growth we had expected at the start of 2019. Despite this capacity level, our expectations for full-year cost per ASM, excluding fuel and special items is unchanged from previous guidance at approximately up 4%.","For the fourth quarter, we continue to expect that our CASM, excluding fuel and special items will grow by approximately 3% despite the additional reduction in ASMs due to the MAX grounding in the fourth quarter.","Looking forward, we see no signs of macro softness there for bookings. We expect domestic demand to remain robust and Latin to again be the best performing international entity.","We expect our fourth quarter year-over-year TRASM to be flat to up 2% and PRASM to be about a point better than TRASM.","We also expect that our pre-tax margin excluding net special items to be between 5% and 7%, the mid-point of which would represent the third consecutive quarter of pre-tax margin expansion.","Given our expectations for the fourth quarter, we believe that our full-year earnings per diluted share excluding net special items will be between $4.50 and $5.50. We have tightened the top-end of our previous guidance of 4.50 to $6 per share due to the additional $140 million reduction in earnings from the deferral of the MAX in 2020.","Our total projected capital expenditures for 2019 is expected to be 4.3 billion comprised of 1.7 billion in non-aircraft CapEx and 2.7 billion in aircraft CapEx. The slight change from previous guidance is due to the timing of the MAX deliveries moving from 2019 to 2020.","Finally, I would like to give some preliminary guidance for 2020. We're still working on the final budget and there is still a measure of uncertainty over when our MAX aircraft will be introduced to service and new aircraft delivered and available for use in our fleet. As Doug mentioned, we plan to grow our network with efficient and profitable growth.","At this point, we anticipate total 2020 year-over-year capacity growth of approximately 5%. This is higher than the year-over-year 2020 growth we had anticipated in the beginning of 2019, but there's entirely due to the grounding of the MAX and the cancellations resulting from the disruption of our operations, which reduced capacity in 2019.","Importantly, our year end 2020 absolute capacity is in line with our expectations from the beginning of 2019. Given this capacity guidance, we have tightened our estimate for CASM ex-fuel special items and new labor agreements to be approximately flat in 2020.","With that, we'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and to begin a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","And our first question comes from Joe DeNardi from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Joe DeNardi","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Doug, whatever coffee you had this morning, I would like some of that. I'm wondering if you could just talk about kind of expectations for earnings next year. If you've lost $500 million or $600 million from the MAX and maybe a couple hundred million more from the mechanics issues, how much of that can you kind of recapture next year? Why shouldn't kind of the base level of earnings for the business be somewhere closer to $4 billion next year? Thank you.","Doug Parker","Sure, Joe. Again, we won\u2019t be able to give you a much better guidance as we get through our budgeting process just begun. We can do a better job of giving you estimates next quarter, but with the two headwinds that you mentioned that we faced this year certainly should not be headwinds next year. And the amounts you described the one you showed just a little bit down is the MAX and they're not all back in January 1, as Robert described it, they phase in over the course of the year. So to the extent, whatever that headwind was in 2019 I don't think you should build all that in for 2020. But our run rate earnings are right and I'm not by any means trying to give you an earnings estimate, but absolutely agree that whatever earnings are going to be in 2019, they're going to be a good bit better. They're going to be better for the two reasons you suggest.","Joe DeNardi","Okay. And then you've never really talked about the free cash flow outlook that bullishly. I don't think, in terms of how much it is relative to your market cap, I just want to make sure I kind of understand, I mean, from a leverage standpoint, nothing has changed, the leverage will kind of come down naturally. But we should assume that the free cash flow is primarily used to repurchase stock. Is that the idea going forward?","Doug Parker","Yes, again let me expand a little bit then. You're right, we haven't disclosed the numbers Joe really, I mean, not because they're dramatically different than we would have said in the past versus now a year. We have -- we consistently said in the past, we're going through a period of high CapEx once we get through it, you should expect to see us generate free cash flow. When we do that, we will naturally de-lever all those statements I hopefully you would agree, we always said. What we haven't been able to do or we kind of wanted to really I\u2019m going to just tell you three years from now, here's what the numbers will be. And now and now it's upon us. And as that free cash flow gets generated in 2020, we can give you more clarity on that, so we\u2019re happy to.","The $5.5 billion of free cash that I mentioned again is simple math on steady state earnings; we can all decide what earnings might be as we go forward. But that's what that is. And again, we certainly aren\u2019t going to be happy if 2019 earnings are the earnings in 20 and 21.","The debt paid down numbers that I gave you are reasonably simple math. Just looking at what we what we know amortizes over the next few years and what we believe we needed to add as we do have additional requirements, but obviously, the amortizations exceed the requirements. So that's -- that number again is nothing -- it's a number we go from here giving because it's what the math is telling us.","And then to your point, to the extent that first number the free cash flow generation is greater than our needs to run the airline or retire debt, we believe that cash certainly in excess of our very high cash balances is best used by returning it to our shareholders, it\u2019s their cash, us holding more than we need is a horrible use of capital. And we should return that to you as efficiently as possible. And we believe [indiscernible] by repurchasing our shares. So that's what you should expect to see from us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. Doug, I guess just looking back on the last couple of years I mean, I understand that the MAX definitely was quite disruptive this year, and you guys do have some good things going on in the network. But even giving credit for that, it does look like your Op income is still down on like a two-year basis and what's been a pretty robust economy. And not that we're necessarily comping every day to your peers, but their Op income is up in that same time period. So what retrospectively looking forward, what can change in this dynamic where American can start to really leverage the economy?","Doug Parker","Sure, thanks, Brandon. Again well I don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me, what I do know is first off I would always argue that for airlines operating incomes is a tough measure to look at if you're trying to really look at just the operating performance and I encourage you to look at EBITDA, I know we always encourage you to capitalize our operating leases on the balance sheet.","And you should do the same thing by not including the operating leases in your operating cash flows and it makes a difference. So, when you do look at EPS, so I\u2019ll suggest when I look at the numbers myself is part of what you\u2019re seeing in deterioration relative to others is what I just talked about, which is our fleet modernization, which is now done versus theirs, which is about to come.","But putting it aside, I don't disagree with your point and none of us should that we've underperformed elsewhere not just in the ownership costs. And as we look to that, the primary reason is related to the issues we talked about. We have seen our properly adjusted [indiscernible] adjusted, unit revenue gap certainly versus delta which was widening as we - every year since the merger, I\u2019m sorry, which is narrowing every year since the merger, starting to widen the last six quarters. And that's not what we should be doing. We should be narrowing that gap, not widening it. Again, there are a number of reasons as to why it is but the biggest ones tend to be that we haven't executed on an operation. But I\u2019m aware there's no doubt that 737 MAX issue certainly has led to the widening of that gap. But as opposed to trying to explain what it is, what I'll tell you is we're committed now to going forward and we feel very good about that.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, I appreciate that. And I mean the relationships still kind of hold on EBITDAR basis, but that sounds good. I guess on the upside though, you guys did call out. I think Dallas in the second quarter, RASM being up a 1.5 points, I think now you\u2019re talking about in, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the hub being up about 3.5 in the third quarter. So it looks like maybe incrementally as your hubs scaling here, it's getting better performance. Is that right? And do we think that Charlotte can be the same in 2020?","Doug Parker","Vasu Raja is here and we\u2019ll let him take that one Brandon.","Vasu Raja","Yes. And so a little bit of the effect that you see is really the effect of the peak of summer happening more in the third quarter. That said we do see a significant benefit as we improve the connectivity of our hubs. We see that not only the marginal revenues of our new flying is coming in well above the system average it\u2019s having a meaningful impact on all the flights that remain.","So for example, the new flights, the new routes that we added, the new frequencies came in about 85-plus-percent marginal PRASM, we're expecting to come in at 75% but had a meaningful impact on our big trunk routes, DFW-LA, DFW-Vegas. We do anticipate an effect like that in Charlotte.","And indeed we expect a meaningful effect in Charlotte because while we grow the hub and departures and improve the connectivity, we will also up-gauge the hubs. So we will have more seats on all of those, those are really [the bench] [ph] connection.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie Baker","Nice to hear the renewed vigor. Are there any triggers with Boeing in the contract or potentially with lessors that would allow you to alter the delivery schedule once the MAX pipeline resumes? Also on the 5% capacity growth, what metrics do you look towards next year in determining if that's the right rate for example, would you tolerate margin contraction in 2020 after all with the pace of the buyback, you could still take out some earnings growth and free cash flow but at lower margins, would that be deemed acceptable by the team?","Doug Parker","Let me try [indiscernible]. Irrespective what the contract, may or may not do, we want these airplanes. We want, if we refine them all today, we'd be doing. So as soon as they can be as soon as they're certified, and we have got pilots trained, we'd like to get them into service as quickly as possible. What Robert described you is what we believe is as quickly as possible. So that's, and that's the great thing to do is so we're not looking to change the delivery schedule and if anything we'd like to accelerate the delivery schedule. We feel really good about our growth prospects. Second part of the question, sorry, I think I might have answered already but go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Yes. Would you tolerate margin contraction next year after all, and not that be involved into a modeling discussion, but still get the earnings growth and free cash at lower margins. Would you accept that outcome?","Doug Parker","We -- we're not -- anyway -- we\u2018re going to try and maximize value at all times, not so much try to manage earnings as much as maximizing value. We believe the way to maximize value is to continue to expand our network. We have fewer players today than we would like. That's a rare situation for American Airlines. But I'll tell you, every meeting we have with our planning team; they're looking on the table asking for more aircraft not fewer. We want to get those airplanes into the system. Again, this is not, this is growth you should be happy about that we work on the table for. This is in our core markets filling out something that is very rarely able, we are able to do. We just take hubs Dallas\/Fort Worth and Charlotte where we have gauged and add more flights into those hubs, that\u2019s really, really good growth. And we want to do it as quickly as we can and irrespective of what that may do next year's margins earnings I don't know. What I know is that [indiscernible].","Jamie Baker","Okay. And second question, does the free cash flow commentary for 2020 include or is it predicated on Boeing competition?","Doug Parker","It is not. I told you - again what\u2019s predicated on is, to be crystal clear, it is predicated on flat earnings year-over-year, so that\u2019s what it is.","Jamie Baker","Perfect.","Doug Parker","And again that\u2019s not an earnings forecast. It\u2019s giving you a free cash flow number, if we had flat earnings, you should do your own earnings forecast. We'll do our best to give you a better guidance on that next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for your time. Doug, if I just take your $540 million number from the MAX that you laid out. I assume some of that -- I think some of that would probably reverse in 2020 even if the MAX doesn't come back at all, just because it's no longer a surprise that you don't have it. Is that accurate? And can you help us break out sort of the impact of having to sort of manage the schedule on a day-to-day basis the way you did versus the impact of just having less capacity overall. Does that make sense?","Doug Parker","Yes. I think I understand the reverse side of it. What we have to remember is, I mean this is really total revenue that we lost on this is about $700 million. If you take the proposal that's the 540. So really we were lower ASMs by about 1.8%. So we just didn't fly those ASMs right. We don't get those back. So that revenue doesn't come back. Now the expenses that we had and we spent on there, those are going to be there. So you should have not see, when we put this growth back in, you shouldn't see the CASM go up as much because of the fact that the expenses were already there. So the 540 is really a number where you take about $700 million of revenue due to the not flying offset by some costs that gets you there. And you're right; the costs that are embedded in the airline today are here already to fly the aircraft when they come. So that should be, I shouldn't have to add those costs as those planes come back in. And I think that's what you're asking. Right?","Darryl Genovesi","Actually, I was kind of asking more about the scenario where, you sort of don\u2019t -- you kind of don't get it back, right. I mean, suppose, you know, January 15th ends up being way optimistic. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much I should expect this, how much I should expect this flat CASM ex guide to move around based on the fact that I think, there are probably, for instance, I mean you're probably not going to be asking, pilots to be on schedules and getting hit by that to the extent that you did early on in this process. And so I guess I was thinking that there's probably some CASM ex relief associated with just not kind of having to manage things on a day-to-day basis like that.","Doug Parker","Yes, you're definitely right on that. This is assuming the MAX coming back at the schedule that Robert had talked about. There could be changes to that just depending as we go forward. But this is assuming the MAX schedule that Robert talked about where they phase back into the early part of the year. And the deliveries do come in.","Robert Isom","Hi Darryl, I'll just add that. The pilots are here, the flight attendants are here, the gates are here. So for the most part, we're ready to fly these aircraft. If we want to hear something from Boeing that was just incremental changes there's not on a heck of a lot that you can build that. To the extent that there would be something that say you don't give us much more visibility long into the future. Of course we would make adjustments. But right now it's really just around the edges that we can cut back.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And have you slowed your hiring at all? In submission [ph] that just keeps that this continues to linger?","Doug Parker","We slowed early in the fall here, but then we're hiring back up to meet the schedule needs for early part of the first quarter. So we're back making sure that we can fly the schedule that Robert talked about with the aircraft coming back, so that when they come back, we're ready to roll.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Doug Parker","Hey, Hunt.","Hunter Keay","Hey, Doug good morning. I actually have a question for Derek and a question for Vasu. Derek, can you just help me understand the accounting of how you guys will realize the concession payments from Boeing don't care how much it's going to be just want to know if it's going to impact the P&L is my main question?","Derek Kerr","We do not have an answer on that yet. It all depends on how we get it back. The accounting is if you get it against the aircraft price that would just go into reduced aircraft price and wouldn't hit the P&L. If it comes back as lost earnings, it possibly could hit the P&L. So we don't -- we do not know yet. We're in negotiations with Boeing and have continued to talk with them. And as we continue to go through that, we will update everybody on where it will hit P&L and if it will hit the P&L and what that number is going to be.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Great. And then Vasu, the 5% capacity growth. I'm surprised that\u2018s so low, it implies only about 3.5% core growth in 2020. Can you help me? Can you peel that back for me a little bit? I mean, how is this so low and maybe you can talk about a mix of domestic and international gauge anything like that I was expecting you guys to show more like 4% or 5% sort of core growth. So is that a conservative number, any color on that would be great from your perspective. Thank you.","Vasu Raja","Yes, hey Hunter first of all, we're still working through our high level of operations for next year. But I'd say the simple way to think of it is that about a quarter-and-a-half or so is just the bring back of the MAX. The remainder of it is the growth of our core business. And of that remainder, it's pretty evenly split between just a variety of gauge initiatives and an actual departure-based growth.","As far as the domestic and international split we're still kind of working through that right now. Of course, we've announced a lot of international receiving probably backs off for some of it. But we anticipate that domestic will moderately outgrow International, but it'll be pretty close. But we're refining it more in the next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Your line is open.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thank you. Derek, sorry, if I didn't hear it correctly. But does your flat CASM outlook or preliminary flat CASM outlook include or exclude new labor agreements?","Derek Kerr","It excludes labor agreements.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. And how would you handicap probabilities. And I know you don't want to talk about terms but timing on mechanics and pilots next year?","Doug Parker","Hey Duane, I will talk on that one. Again I said in my comments I\u2019ve agreed NMB\u2019s request not to discuss, we\u2019re under negotiations and that starts to do it. I know it's important to you. We hopefully understand, we're much more focused on getting the negotiation done. I don't want to jeopardize that. So if you don't mind, what is telling you that we're happy to run negotiations, we're happy that the NMB has asked us in post live not to talk about it. We think that helps the negotiations rather than hurt them and we don't want to violate that when we do have a contract. We will absolutely let you know the answers to those questions.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Totally fair, sorry for asking.","Doug Parker","Okay, not a problem.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Appreciate the surprise that was kind of dumped on you by the Chilean courts, which catalyzed this change with LATAM. But can you talk about how you're going to replace that feed? For example, would you envision a JV across multiple airlines in South America?","Robert Isom","I'll go ahead and then start on that. The great news is that our network by far the best in the South America, there's a lot that we can do to augment that on our own. And while again, LATAM was disappointing you also have to realize the nature of what that was and what it could be. So for now, customers are choosing to purchase American and fly American. And as we take a look at what goes for of course that network we have in South America could be really attractive to a lot of partners. And so we're busy working and exploring and evaluating the opportunities that are out there right now so, good things to come.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savi Syth","Just a question on the International growth here in the Trans-Atlantic. I recognize you had some individual items and FX that was kind of hurting it, what\u2019s driving the kind of the double-digit increase and would you expect that to moderate, given the unit revenue pressures?","Vasu Raja","Yes, hi this is Vasu. Look a lot of what's really driving our capacity growth that growth was just simply the growth of capacity. As Derek mentioned in his opening remarks in the last year, we did a lot to go and restructure international network, we cut something in the order of 17 or 18 routes across the system that were really long-term money losers, and we turned them into 22 new routes, much of which was growth in Trans-Atlantic and all of which is coming at a really attractive revenue clip.","They are having some issues in 3Q with foreign exchange and things like that, as Derek mentioned, but the marginal profitability of the routes we've added in Trans-Atlantic has been pretty impressive. And indeed, year-to-date, our Trans-Atlantic unit revenues on an absolute basis have been higher than they've been in any point since the merger. So we're encouraged by it. It's been really great utilization for our airplanes, and all together margin positive for us.","Savi Syth","Thank you. And then if might ask on the network side question, just curious on your view on Chicago, it's -- you've made some changes there. And one of your competitors is definitely kind of refocused in that hub and now is -- is they kind of introduce the 550 some of those the leadership that you had with some of the kind of the taking advantage of your larger great regional aircraft opportunity there. That advantage seems to be eroding as we look forward in the network. Any thoughts on how you view kind of the performance in Chicago and your positioning in Chicago?","Robert Isom","Yes, we're actually really excited for our future in Chicago on a number of levels that I mean for one, and I've talked about this probably in lot of forum, removing Chicago to Asia, for us has been actually a big benefit to the Chicago hub. A lot of that was not just unprofitable flying in and of itself, it was claiming space off of domestic airplanes and things like that that could have otherwise gone to other customers in the Chicago local market or people connecting from other parts of business.","So that alone has been a big change in Chicago. And also as we look forward though, our principal competitor there is indeed rolling out the new product, the reality is, we still will be able to offer more First Class seats to the Chicago customer. We absolutely intend to continue doing that.","One of the major things that we're excited for, as we go into next year and work through the MAX situation is it will have a lot more flexibility to do things like bringing the A319 into Chicago, which will enable us to kind of upguage regional jet markets to vary our capacity more through day of week, create a lot of variability in the schedule that ultimately goes into tracks the key business customers in the Chicago and Greater Midwest area that our principal competitor seems to be targeting.","So we very much like our chances out there, we very much will continue to do that. And even going forward looking longer run as we ourselves continue to aggressively replace single class 50 seat RJs with 2-class airplanes, Chicago will be a place where we'll continue to thrive and be able to produce some improving results.","Don Casey","This is Don. I will just add one more data timeframe and we really have performed the domestic business in the third quarter we have 12% and our best performing hub for unit revenue was Chicago.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Doug, a question for you, I appreciate the enthusiasm this morning but what makes this time different versus before? I mean, we've heard relatively bullish pitches from you and I'll stay down in Dallas a couple of years ago, so what stands out this time versus then the story get the buy-in from investors and analysts alike?","Doug Parker","One, you haven\u2019t heard from us before these cash flow initiatives, other cash volumes, sorry generation because we couldn't say it before. Again, that's not anything I feel pretty badly about. We needed to invest in this company. And we were describing the time to our investors and it was going to be significant. And the reality is, while we were making record profits, we weren't generating cash flow because we were spending it on upgrading our fleet of that $31 billion I talked about in the last six years, $23 billion of that was spent on new airplanes. So that's behind us, so that's a new message, hope it gets a change in bullishness, it's a new message and one that I think is important to our investors. So that's point one.","And the other only what I'd add to the bullishness piece is our bullishness at the moment is not driven by us seeing anything differently than anyone else, it's driven by our absolute understanding that we -- our earnings this year were hindered by two circumstances that we fully expect to be behind us early in 2020 and our commitment to ensure that we have operational excellence and the growth prospects all of that as we try in Chicago, in conclusions that\u2019s what we are.","Rajeev Lalwani","All right, that\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, just maybe for Derek as well broadly on labor, I don't want to talk about specific contracts but broadly on labor, do you believe that you've got a step-up in wages to get the buy-in of employees? I mean, that was sort of a strategy united it seems to be successful for now. But maybe I'm not thinking about it or approaching it the right way that that may be needed to deliver on some of what you're describing?","Derek Kerr","Yes, look as we talk to our employees, the biggest thing we need to do for our team is provide our live operation. We and thanks to some frontline leadership have done a really nice job of taking care of our team we have, as you're well aware needed to increase compensation across the board to get our wage levels to where their peers in other airlines are because they certainly deserve to be paid relative as much or more as those that are doing similar jobs at airlines.","But this the issue we're dealing with now as it relates to the team is, we need to give them the tools they need to do their jobs, which they do so incredibly well. That's go and take care of customers. And we haven't been doing that. We don't run, we don't have operational excellence; our team ends up bearing the brunt of that. They end up not being where they're supposed to be, they end up having inventory over time, they end up having unhappy customers, all of which impact the runoff. So what we're -- what we know and further is operational excellence is to our customers and to our shareholders. It's really important to our team, and that's all those reasons why we're so committed to making sure it happens, and we believe doing that will do more for our team than anything else we can do right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mike Linenberg","Yes, hey Doug. Hey, two quick questions here, I guess on fleet, Doug, the $8 billion to $10 billion reduction in net debt over the next five years. Presumably, there's no major fleet decision for American probably out till 2024, 2025. That's kind of implicit in that. And if that is the case, what is the next aircraft type in the fleet that you're looking at that, you then have to address? What's the timing on that? Thank you.","Doug Parker","I would add, I\u2019ll let Derek to add. Yes, that\u2019s Mike. [Indiscernible] we will have the MDAs were gone out, the A190 were gone out of the fleet, the 760 were gone out of the fleet, 75s will eventually go out of the fleet. So the next real big decision for us is in the A319 category. Everything else will those aircraft are and on average 15 years today. So as you said, we don't have any decision to make until, 2025 timeframe, we might talk earlier, but I think it's really in that category, the 319 category and what will be the replacement for that and our 320 at the bottom and 150 seat range to 130 seat range.","Derek Kerr","And Mike I\u2019ve got the data points for you and everyone else. As we look at our fleet now, only 10% of our fleet, only 10% of our fleet was 20 years or older as compared, contrasted to our two large competitors have about a third of their fleets 20 years or older. So anyway, it'll be a while, we feel very good. And indeed, over half of our fleet is zero to 10 years. So we again, it took us a while to get there, we had to spend a lot to do it. But we feel really good about where we are with our fleet and certainly relative to our cash needs versus our competitors going forward.","Mike Linenberg","Agreed, great position to be in. And then just my second follow-up on, on the A321 NEO, I mean, you're obviously taking delivery of them now and into 2020. Given that you are I think Airbus you may be their largest customer for the A320 family right now just looking at your fleet and the potential, any chance that you can have those airplanes deliver out of Mobile rather than Europe as we move forward?","Derek Kerr","Yes. I would say, this is Derek and we have already a schedule out through the mid of 2020, where we'll have nine coming out of Mobile, six of them are Hamburg today. And then we have still six to be determined. So we'll do everything we can, we have 21 deliveries for the next two years, we're doing everything we can to talk to Airbus, to try to get them out of Mobile and make sure that those aircraft come from that manufacturing facility instead of Hamburg. But as of today of the 21, we have come in six come from Hamburg, nine from Mobile and six yet to be determined, which are late in 2020 that we will continue to work to get to those out of Mobile.","Doug Parker","Hi Mike, impliciting your question, I think is that if we didn't do that that we would be paying the tariffs, as what you have been saying that, let me assume we did.","Mike Linenberg","Yes, definitely.","Doug Parker","Look what we know don't think no that the USTR place the tariffs with the level it did to ensure that the burden didn't get borne by U.S. airlines but by the French. So we're happy to work with airbus to mitigate that amount. But I don't think you should assume that if it's not mitigated that American Airlines would be -- would be a worse borne.","Having said that, what we really hope is that it never get to that point, the answer this is not to keep escalating and having tariffs on both sides. The answer to this is for the European Commission, USTR sit down and work this out in a way that doesn't have tariffs going places. But if they can't do that, this again, we're certain that the goal of the USTR was not to have these tariffs paid by U.S. airlines, and then passed on to U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is open.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. And thank you for the time. I just had two questions. My first question is with respect to how you're intending to use Envoy on some of your other regional airlines for the capacity growth that you're doing in Dallas, in Charlotte. And then my other follow-up question is, as you think about growing Latin America, which you\u2019ve talked about in your prepared remarks relative to taking up that capacity that you're kind of losing with LATAM, is there space at Miami that do the same thing you're doing in Charlotte, DCA and in Dallas? Thank you.","Vasu Raja","Hey, Helane, this is Vasu. Let me take your questions in reverse order. First of all, space in Miami. Yes, we have the space in Miami to grow in any number of ways adding the three flights that Robert mentioned earlier and is all accommodated within the capacity footprint that we have there. We have a really great position in Miami, a really great relationship with Miami airport and community at large. And so the way we see this is Robert says that we will always have the biggest and the best Latin American network, it is at the very heart of our competitive advantage as an airline. And that's one thing that that even through all of this stuff we will continue to do and will continue to be able to go and operate in Miami and grow there, though it doesn't have the profitability of markets like DFW and Charlotte, there are routes out of Miami that are among -- are most critical for our customers and certainly and in certain days a week in times of year, it was really attractive marketplace for us and you'll see us take full advantage of that in the year ahead.","To your first question about Envoy growth, which I think in part you meant Envoy maybe you meant kind of regional versus mainline. I'll speak to both, our growth this past year has been heavily driven by the regional operations. Next year it will be more heavily driven by our mainline operation. Our growth in Charlotte especially is less about growing our regional jets. It's about one improving the connectivity of the hub making more O&D market and very critically having more seats on all those O&Ds. So you'll see a few things like bring the 737s in the larger degree, turn more regional jets in the mainline, we endeavor to do the same thing in DFW as well. Now that said our regional jet network is a very critical part of our airline that does, as we say the little jets make the big jets go. And so we -- there will be a big dose of regional jet growth as well. It'll just lag the mainline next year, whereas this year it kind of outpaced the mainline.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan McKenzie for Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, good morning, thanks for the time here. If possible, I would love to clarify the messaging on 2020, so CASM ex-fuel flat next year, you expect to grow earnings investors are going to interpret that as your base outlook for either revenues to be flat or up despite a pretty high capacity picture. So not asking for 2020 revenue guidance, of course, but just trying to make sure there is just no flaw here in the preliminary? Thank you.","Doug Parker","But you are asking for revenue guidance. If we take out the CASM is flat [indiscernible] earnings are up, sounds like that revenue guidance. But look I wanted to go back to what we said so far Dan and we are not yet prepared to give you real guidance on earnings in 2020 because we are doing our own work and so we will let you know more as we know more ourselves. Certainly in the next call, we want to give you better guidance on 2020. Earnings forecast but and you should do your own work on what you think about and thinking on revenue and where we are relative to that, right now we can\u2019t give you much more than this.","Dan McKenzie","Yes, understood. Okay, had to try of course. Okay, so good commentary, free cash flow demand, solid revenue backdrop, there is worry that the parallel universe that the consumer today goes the way of the industrial sector tomorrow, I've had more than one conversation with owners about what Americans earnings would look like in the downturn. And again, I know that's not your message today, but can you talk about the fleet flexibility, so both narrow-body, wide-body and is there a way to get ahead of the economic data points as they start to worsen?","Derek Kerr","Yes, Dan we have a significant amount of fleet flexibility. We have unencumbered aircraft, some 264 aircraft, almost 100 of those mainline, 172 Regional, we have 65 deliveries to come next year which we could, we could deal with if we needed to lease extensions, there's about 47 of those that would come off and then older aircraft, we have 53 of those, which most of those are in the unencumbered category. So and we have upwards 300 350 aircraft, fleet flexibility that if something happened, we could take the fleet down, if required if there was some type of a recession or anything like that, but as I said earlier, we're not seeing anything like that in our bookings, and things just continue to stay strong.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our last analyst question from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.","David Vernon","Hi, guys, thanks for taking the time. Question for you on the focus for 2020. Obviously, Rob and Doug you talked about getting the anti-performance and the basic execution done and improved. I'm just wondering if there are specific things in the revenue pipeline that will help you to narrow that gap that you mentioned before on the unit revenue side with some of your peers.","Don Casey","Yes, this is Don. Again, if you go and look at our past year\u2019s unit revenue performance this year in 2019, we did better than our [indiscernible] by 1 point based on guidance for 4Q that was based on the readiness in the pipeline this year, which also included our growing operation in Dallas, which we had in place, 1st of July. So as we look forward into 2020, we continue to have a pipeline of revenue initiatives.","Obviously next year, big part of that is going to be the annualization of growth in Dallas, adding the growth in Charlotte, and we are going to be updating and adding seats to airplanes, which is going to be great thing to our revenue performance in 2020.","David Vernon","Anything on the product set specifically that you can talk to around whether it's some of the premium products or some of the other work you've been doing on the cabin side that would help us kind of look for scale to get some update?","Doug Parker","Don you can chime in here, but hey one is that we're finally getting to the point of being able to offer instant upsell in higher level cabin. So as we've been improving our affiliate segment, whether it's through main Cabin Extra or premium economy type seats, being able to offer that to customers in a convenient way, is something that we finally have the technology to be able to do and that was launched earlier this summer, expanded throughout the domestic and now we're looking to move that that to international and also into other channels as well.","So that's something that will absolutely help us take advantage of the product offerings that we have out there.","And to Don\u2019s point, in terms of being able to harmonize our cabins and ensure that we have the configurations we want. We had to take a hiatus because of operational issues this past summer on those programs, those have been restarted and we anticipate that our 737 classic fleet will be fully upgraded by the summer of 2021.","David Vernon","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the deleveraging that's going to happen over the next couple of years. Is there anything you can tell us about the rates on this that you'll be retiring versus the rates you're paying on more recent debt like is there going to be any sort of shift in the effect of interest rate as you are modeling out the next couple years for cash flow?","Derek Kerr","I would say -- this is Derek. I would say no, I think our average debt is around 4% right now. So most of the higher price that we've paid off, it might be slightly higher of the old things we are going to pay off because most of it is aircraft that will include pension too. So we're going to take the pension down by about $3 billion in that calculation. So from an aircraft standpoint, it will be older aircraft that that is probably up in the 5% range, little bit higher than what our average cost of debt but not significantly higher.","Doug Parker","Just for clarification, $3 billion in the $8 billion to $10 billion.","Derek Kerr","Yes, $3 billion is in the $8 billion to $10 billion sorry of the -- over the five-year period.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now open up the lines for media to ask questions. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. And our first question we will take is Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.","Alison Sider","Hi, thank you so much, hi. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about sort of the tone of the discussions you're having with Boeing around compensation. Is there progress being made or from your comments this morning, is there concern about an impact there?","Doug Parker","Alison I will start. Again the discussions are underway, but I guess I characterize it as early. I think not just -- no reason for us to be concerned at this point, but also no real clarity at this point. Much of the reason being, from the standpoint of Boeing still not certainty as to when the aircraft will be recertified. So talks are underway but they're early, but we feel highly confident that the losses that American Airlines have incurred, won't be incurred by American shareholders but will be borne by the Boeing shareholders.","Alison Sider","Got it. And are you concerned at all about any additional delays in return to service timing and I guess, broadly do you feel like Boeing, the leadership changes this may lately have gone far enough or do you think the company might have to do more?","Doug Parker","We were asked to return to service. The answer to that question asked to return to service. Our -- the date that we have January 15 is based on the best information we have from talking to not just Boeing but the FAA. We were encouraged to see Boeing announce I think earlier this week that they believe the aircraft will be certified in the fourth quarter.","So, that information, I guess is probably -- it's probably safe it is probably best described that information in best case given what we've all seen over the course of this process, but it's a reasonable case. And therefore, we, if indeed, that is -- that situation is correct, if indeed the aircraft is recertified in the fourth quarter, we absolutely, we will be able to have our five airplanes as I described, certified flying revenue as early as January 15. If indeed that doesn't tend to be the case, we will once again, need to adjust. And we've unfortunately are getting really good at that, we have designed this one in particular, to be easier to do than others in that regard.","So, yes, we're frustrated. But it is hopefully getting to the point. It certainly feels as though the delay that we hear about seem to be shorter delays. The confidence seems to be higher. But we don't take that as certainly close to it. But based on everything we know today, certainly seems reasonable to have these aircraft and our schedule to five airplanes January 15 and we are highly to be the case. If indeed that has not been the case, we will adjust and let our customers know well in advance.","Alison Sider","Got it, thanks and on leadership.","Doug Parker","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson from USA Today. Your line is open.","Doug Parker","Hi Dawn.","Dawn Gilbertson","Hi, good morning. Hey, two questions. One Robert you mentioned under your consumer initiative, new technology, I think you said related to helping families sit together. Can you go into any detail on that? And my second question is seat fees are really prevalent right now. And I'm wondering where that you can give any sense of the revenue opportunities there and where that ranks right now in terms of ancillary revenue? Thanks.","Robert Isom","Hey Dawn, I didn't hear the second part of the question. The first part is just in terms of sitting families together, I\u2019ll just say this, we've always had a technology to help, we've improved our algorithms. And ultimately, we're getting a much better hit rate of making sure that we protect and we reserve seats for those families. And so there's good things, there's good things on that front, but all technology-based and really enhancements to processes that we have in place today. But now as it works, the second part of your question was I didn't appear there was seat fees, did you said that?","Dawn Gilbertson","I wanted to get a sense of the scope of you started these preferred seat fees and every all airlines have them now pretty much to one degree or another. And it seems to me that's got to be a pretty big revenue. You're bringing a lot of money from these preferred seat fees. And I'm just wondering if you can give us any sense of the scope of that, where you plan to take that and where that ranks now in kind of in the ancillary hierarchy?","Don Casey","Yes. This is Don Casey. We've done quite a bit on the seat service. One is just introducing different products; the main Cabin Extra we\u2019re going to relaunch with enhanced benefits a year ago, that has proven to be very successful. And again there are customers do have the willingness to pay right a bit more for their product. And that's what we're finding out in the marketplace. So we're continuing to expand the product portfolio for better products out there and provide better capabilities for customers to buy out into those better products. And we're seeing good demand. Seat fee revenue today is now our second largest ancillary revenue stream after bags.","Dawn Gilbertson","If I could just ask just a quick follow-up related to that, when you say on seat fee revenue, does that include so that includes your preferred seat fees, where you get nothing extra and also main Cabin Extra? What's in that basket?","Don Casey","It\u2019s basically every additional charge that customer is willing to pay for a better seat on the airplane. So in the case of preferred seats, those are aisles and windows and close to the front. And they have an extra, extra leg room, free drink and better dedicated access to games and [indiscernible].","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tracy Rucinski from Reuters. Your line is open.","Doug Parker","Hi, Tracy.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi, good morning. Doug, I was wondering what is your own position on the Boeing employees\u2019 instant messages about MCAST and the simulator and the emails that referred to not including mention of MCAST in the flight manual?","Doug Parker","We don\u2019t have a position on that. Our position is we're highly interested in having the airplane. Boeing meet the requirements of the FAA and get the airplane recertified. I will note that we think the FAA is doing a fantastic job with this process and it\u2019s showing real leadership. They always do on safety in aviation, and we feel really confident that once the FAA recertifies this airplane it\u2019s one of the safest in the world. And we're looking forward to that date.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Edward Russell from The Points Guy. Your line is open.","Edward Russell","All right, thank you. Vasu I need to ask about your comments on Chicago, you mentioned offering more first class seats than competitors and then you talked about shifting to more A319s in 2020. However, my understanding it\u2019s been, it\u2019s eight first class seats versus some of your 12 seat aircraft at 12 instead of offering 10 on their new door aircraft, door class aircraft, talk a bit more about what's the strategy is to attract business travelers in the Chicago market?","Vasu Raja","Yes, Ed, great question. And importantly, the 319 eight first class seats anytime we're taking out a single class 50 seater, and replacing with bigger jet. Of course going from zero first class seats to something more than that, regardless of what it is. So with that in mind, really, there's multiple things that we plan to do in Chicago. One of which is look, we have a luxury in Chicago that our competitor doesn't have, which is that we have a gigantic East West Hub in DFW for our competitor that is the best East West Hub that they have. And so what we're really interested in doing is being able to provide the best product and schedule to the customers of Chicago to the world.","And we will increasingly do this as we move through a number of our fleet initiatives and product initiatives too. We will have better schedule on the key days the business travelers go; we will vary the capacity levels that we have in the course of the week. And then over the long-term, what will increasingly do is as we do more 50 seat replacements, you'll see more and more two-class services, whether it's larger, RJ319, or 737s coming into Chicago.","Don Casey","I will just ask Don that customers right now, I mean they like our product in Chicago and we\u2019re seeing it in the numbers. I mentioned earlier in Chicago is the highest in any hub we have and we grew our corporate passenger volumes in Chicago in the third quarter by 7%. So customers like the product we have there right now.","Edward Russell","Okay, thank you. So just to be clear, I'm understanding the 50 seaters will come out 319 this year and seat markets will step up to 76 seaters and those [indiscernible] that's kind of the idea of sort of the cascade going on for Boeing?","Robert Isom","Yes, Ed. Over time they will, we're working through what that looks like. I think at this point, we're probably not yet ready to reveal all of it. But that is our long-term plan, as long been our fleet plan and marketplace Chicago, is kinds of things we have in mind for it.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I now would like to turn the call back over to Doug Parker for any closing remarks.","Doug Parker","All right.

Derek will then walk us through the details of the fourth quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for 2020. And then after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans, and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected.","Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q from the third quarter September -- ending September 30, 2019.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website, the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning. At this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thanks Dan. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today we reported our fourth quarter and full year results for 2019. Excluding net special items, our fourth quarter net earnings were $1.15 per diluted share that's up 19% year-over-year. And our full year net earnings were $4.90 per diluted share that's up 8% on a year-over-year basis.","While it's a solid year-over-year improvement especially given the tough environment we experienced, we know we can perform better and we will. As we look to 2020, we remain focused on three key areas that will create real value for our shareholders; producing excellent operating results; growing efficiently and profitably; and generating significant free cash flow.","The past few months prove that that work is already paying off. When we spoke in October, we noted two key challenges that affected our third quarter earnings. First, we were on the heels of subpar operating reliability results as we work through labor contract negotiations. And second, our 2019 earnings were negatively impacted by the Boeing 737 MAX being grounded for more than seven months bringing a lot of uncertainty and frustration to our customers, our team and our shareholders.","We committed then that we would swiftly and aggressively address both of these near-term issues and we've made meaningful progress. First as it relates to our operating reliability, we've seen enormous improvement including the best quarterly operating performance in company history in this past quarter. Robert is going to talk more about this in a minute, but we're incredibly proud of our team and the great work they're doing to take care of our customers and we're running a great operation.","Second, on the MAX last quarter we discussed our clear position. The financial cost of the MAX grounding should be borne by Boeing shareholders not American. We're pleased that recently we reached a confidential settlement with Boeing to compensate American for the financial damages we incurred in 2019 due to the grounding of the MAX. While we can't disclose details of the agreement, American shareholders should know that the agreement reflects our priority to ensure our shareholders are adequately compensated with real value for the extended grounding.","Of course the settlement only relates to the damages we incurred in 2019 and the MAX is still grounded so we'll continue to hold Boeing accountable for future financial damages to protect our company and our shareholders.","Turning now to our 2020 priorities. First, operational excellence. Robert will talk more about this as I said and the ongoing initiatives we have to continue to ensure excellent operating results into the future. But one thing I want to point out is the impact the operation is already having on customer satisfaction.","Our goal is to become customers' airline of choice and a measure of -- and as a measure of that we're looking to become the industry leader in customer Likelihood to Recommend scores or LTR. Running our reliable operation is a significant driver of that and our fourth quarter LTR results prove it.","In this past quarter, our LTR returned near-record highs and improved year-over-year for the first time since the second quarter of 2018. That gives us great momentum and encouragement for 2020 and beyond.","Turning to efficient profitable growth. We now expect to grow American's network by approximately 4% to 5% in 2020. However, annual growth rate estimates don't really tell the story of growth in American in 2020 because our capacity growth will be lower than 4% to 5% until the MAX returns and will be greater than that as the aircraft returns to service.","But we're excited about that growth both before and after the return to service date, because it will be efficient and profitable growth. It will be in markets that are expected to produce at\/or above average unit revenues largely because the gates we've been able to add in two of our most profitable hubs; Dallas\/Fort Worth and Charlotte.","It will also be highly efficient growth as it will be funded by the return of some aircraft already included on our cost structure, improved operating reliability and an increase in the gauge of our airplanes.","Next in a particular interest to our investors, we are very pleased to have reached a point where we will be generating significant free cash flow. After six years of considerable capital investments in integration and fleet modernization, we're now seeing a significant decline in future CapEx needs and a return on those prior investments.","Derek will provide more information on this in a moment but we expect two-year free cash flow to be $6 billion. We believe that free cash flow yield will be a key differentiator between American and our largest competitors going forward and we will keep investors apprised of our progress. This free cash flow will be used to naturally delever our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.","We continue to estimate that our total adjusted debt will decline by approximately $3 billion to $4 billion over the next two years and $8 billion to $10 billion over the next five years.","So, in summary, we've made real progress in the fourth quarter and we'll apply that same tenacity to 2020. Our team is doing an amazing job of running a reliable operation and taking care of our customers. We have outstanding profitable growth opportunities ahead and we are intent on producing real cash returns for our investors.","With that I'll turn it over to Robert.","Robert Isom","Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. I'd like to start by adding my thanks to the American team for doing a phenomenal job taking care of our customers during the busy holiday travel period. We are pleased with the operation we ran in the fourth quarter and the momentum it gives us to further improve as we head into 2020.","During the critical holiday period, we achieved record results for combined mainline and regional on-time departures, on-time arrivals, and completion factor, a fantastic way to end our strongest operational quarter on record.","Throughout the spring and summer, reliability and customer service suffered because of exceptionally high aircraft out of service. That's not the case today. Since September, start-of-the-day aircraft out of service has steadily improved reaching best-ever levels in December and through January to-date.","On December 24, we had our lowest number of aircraft out of service at the start of the day since the merger with more aircraft available to start the day, more flights departed and arrived on time, with fewer cancellations, and fewer disruptions to our customers' travel flight plans.","To add up to Doug's comments about the MAX, we had previously pushed the return to service date to early June. Of course as new information becomes available like earlier this week, we'll reassess that timeline. And to that end, we'll continue to work closely with the FAA, Boeing our pilots and our unions on return-to-service preparation and a new flight schedule.","As a reminder, by the end of 2020, we had planned to take delivery of an additional 26 MAX aircraft. We understand from Boeing that 13 of those aircraft have been built and are in storage and we expect most of the remaining aircraft to be delivered by the end of 2020.","On the revenue front, we reported record fourth quarter and full year revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was up 3.4% to $11.3 billion. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of unit revenue growth. For the year, our topline grew 2.8% to $45.8 billion. Derek will talk more about our revenue performance in his remarks.","Looking at our business today, the revenue environment remains strong and the economy continues to show no signs of slowing down. Importantly, demand for American's product remains robust as our traffic growth continues to outpace GDP growth.","Corporate demand remains strong and we're picking up share gap within that segment. This is driven in part by our operational improvement during the quarter, but also by the great work of our global sales and distribution team to drive that business forward.","We saw a 28% increase in transactions through NDC-enabled channels during the fourth quarter. This growth is driven by adoption from NDC-connected agencies in both domestic and international points of sale. This is a key component of our goal of being the easiest airline to do business with, so we're excited to see NDC become available to a wider set of customers.","Leisure revenue growth was also very strong in the fourth quarter as we delivered a record load factor and we're off to an outstanding start in the New Year. In 2019, our AAdvantage program enrolled the largest number of new members since the merger with the highest year-over-year growth occurring in the fourth quarter.","We also ended the year with record numbers of co-brand card members, acquisitions, card spend, and flight redemptions. More members than ever are interacting with American through the enhanced digital experience in their -- of their -- in their AAdvantage accounts. And in 2019, our team delivered even more customer benefits by extending -- by expanding dynamically price redemption opportunities across our network.","As Doug mentioned, our operational reliability improved in the fourth quarter and started our Likelihood to Recommend scores. In 2019, we took strides to improve the customer experience in several significant ways. We completed the installation of industry-leading high-speed Wi-Fi across our mainline narrow-body fleet for more than 700 aircraft, giving customers the ability to stay connected from gate to gate.","We introduced the A321neo, enhancing what was already the youngest fleet among U.S. network carriers. We expanded the footprint of our industry-leading premium lounge product with new flagship in Admirals Club lounges in -- at DFW and renovated Admirals Clubs in Boston and Pittsburgh.","We launched innovative partnerships with Apple, Blade, and the James Beard Foundation and expanded our relationship with Hyatt to improve customers' experience throughout their journeys with us. And we introduced biometric boarding and passport scanning and our mobile app expediting the boarding process on international flights.","Of course one of American's biggest competitive advantages is the strength of our network and our ability to grow in our most profitable hubs. We continue to be incredibly pleased with the results from the growth at DFW this past year.","In the fourth quarter, we grew DFW capacity by 9% resulting in a 21% increase in origins and destinations. And importantly, this growth came in at above system average passenger unit revenue. We'll continue to see the benefits of this high margin growth at DFW for years to come as we continue to up-gauge the airline.","A lot of our growth in 2020 will happen at DFW from the lapping of our expansion there last year and also in Charlotte where we added four new gates in late 2019. We have planned to add three additional gates at Charlotte beginning in 2020 and we'll continue to grow in 2021 with the opening of the new regional concourse at Reagan National as well as the compounding effect of our growth at DFW and Charlotte.","On the international side, with full government approval of our joint business with Qantas, customers are already benefiting from new routes and expanded code share and improved frequent flier benefits. In October, we announced new service between DFW and Auckland and Los Angeles and Christchurch starting this year.","Our Atlantic Joint Business continues to perform well and it brings significant benefits to customers in North America and Europe. Last month, we announced a new British Airways-operated service between Portland and London, Heathrow, which is one of eight new transatlantic routes starting this summer throughout the Atlantic Joint Business venture. In addition, late last year, we announced plans to co-locate with British Airways at JFK, which will allow us to more efficiently and immediately connect customers traveling across our networks.","We're also excited about starting our first-ever service to Africa and Poland in 2020 and returning to Tel Aviv as well. We launched a new reciprocal code share with Royal Air Maroc late last year, which will support our new Philadelphia-Casablanca service and allow for easy connections further into Africa.","On January 31, we will stop code sharing with LATAM. American remains the leading carrier and largest carrier between the U.S. and Latin America and the best partner for future relationships. We feel very good about our position in this important region and expect only to grow on our own and with partners in the coming years. And as a result, we don't see any impact to revenue or profitability in 2020.","In summary, we made great progress in the fourth quarter, especially in regard to our operations. We have a solid foundation in place and the demand and revenue environment remains strong. The challenges of last year brought us closer as a team, have aligned us in progress and we're excited to deliver on what we've built so far and continue to focus on our operating reliability, improving the customer experience and capitalizing on our valuable growth opportunities.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.","Derek Kerr","All right. Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Despite the operational and fleet challenges we faced throughout most of 2019, we're able to grow both pre-tax margins and earnings per share for the third successive quarter and for the year. Our fourth quarter pre-tax profit, excluding net special items of $679 million, resulted in a pre-tax margin of 6% as compared to 5.4% in 2018.","The revenue environment continues to be positive, with fourth quarter total revenue growth of 3.4%. Passenger revenues grew by 3.9% to $10.3 billion, a record for the fourth quarter, on unit revenue growth of 0.9 points. For the year, total revenue grew 2.8% to $45.8 billion and was also the highest level of revenue in company history, with total revenue per available seat mile up 1.7%.","Robert touched on our international operations, but as we look at our fourth quarter international revenue performance by entity, we continue to see the strength of our Latin American franchise. Latin America was our best-performing entity during the fourth quarter, with a year-over-year unit revenue improvement of 10%, driven by double-digit unit revenue improvements in Brazil and Mexico.","We also had positive unit revenue growth in Argentina for the quarter, while Caribbean performance was flat. In the fourth quarter, our Pacific unit revenue continued to show improvement, up 1.3% year-over-year, which was aided by our China restructuring last year and our partnership with Japan Airlines. We saw strength in the Japan market and brought China to positive unit revenue territory.","We're executing quickly on our new joint business with Qantas. We recently expanded code share selling to all Qantas and American flights between Australia and New Zealand and the continental U.S., encompassing 104 Qantas and 48 American flights per week during the peak season.","Atlantic revenue was up 4.6% on 8.7% more capacity and a decline in unit revenue of 3.7%. The decline in unit revenue is attributed to a foreign exchange headwind and in part due to a potential labor disruption at one of our joint business partners. Underlying premium demand remained strong and we made good progress with premium leisure customers growing this segment by 15% during the quarter.","Premium economy continues to do well, as the product matures, with the average fares approximately 2.3 times the coach fare. Domestic revenue grew 4.4% from strong load factors, offset in part by weaker yields during the pre-Thanksgiving travel period, which led to somewhat flat unit revenue production during the quarter. Investors shouldn't read too much into the softness we saw in November, as December closed out very strong and those trends have continued into January.","On the cargo front, trade concerns and macro weakness outside the United States continued to weigh on both cargo volumes and yields. When combined with year-over-year international schedule reductions we made in the fourth quarter of 2018, cargo revenues fell 18.3% to $216 million in the fourth quarter.","Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were up 2.1% at $10.6 billion. When fuel and special items are excluded, our unit cost increased in the fourth quarter by 2% compared to 2018, due primarily to higher salaries and benefits, maintenance and regional expenses.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.1 billion in total available liquidity. As we noted on our January 10 investor update, due to the uncertainty of the return of service of the MAX and our commitment to our $7 billion liquidity target, we arranged an additional revolving line of credit to provide the company with increased borrowing capacity of up to $400 million. We don't have any present intention to borrow any amounts under this facility, which matures in September 2020, with an optional extension to December 2020.","During the fourth quarter we paid dividends of $44 million and repurchased approximately $285 million of stock, or 9.9 million shares. We have begun to delever the balance sheet, as our CapEx requirements have come down. As a result, our year-end adjusted debt position decreased by $1.5 billion year-over-year.","Before we turn to guidance, I'd like to talk about the changes we made to the format of our investor update. Due to material uncertainty around the grounding of the MAX, we are adjusting how we provide our forward-looking guidance. Going forward, we will provide guidance on the current quarter and the full year only.","As we look at 2020, with the MAX grounding in mind, we currently project our earnings will be negatively affected by substantially the same amount as our 2019 earnings were impacted. While we expect Boeing to compensate us for these 2020 losses, this compensation is not included in any of our forward guidance.","As Doug mentioned, we now expect that our 2020 capacity growth will be approximately 4% to 5% and that our CASM --2020 CASM growth, excluding fuel special items and new labor deals will be up approximately 1%. However, because our annual metrics like capacity and unit costs are highly sensitive to our MAX return assumptions, it's worth pointing out that these metrics will have a different trajectory in the second half of 2020 than what we are guiding in the first quarter. As such, our CASM will be up 2% to 4% in the first quarter. And when the MAX returns later in the year, our capacity will be higher and our CASM is expected to be down year-over-year.","Looking forward, despite the geopolitical headlines, we continue to see no signs of macro softness in our forward bookings. We expect first quarter domestic demand to remain robust and LATAM to again be the best-performing international entity. With that backdrop, we forecast our first quarter year-over-year TRASM to be flat to up 2%. We also expect that our first quarter pretax margin excluding net special items will be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis.","Based on the assumptions I referenced earlier, we believe, our full year earnings per diluted share excluding net special items will be between $4 and $6 a share. In 2019, we made contributions of more than $1.2 billion to our defined benefit pension plans or $436 million in excess of required contributions, prefunding a portion of our 2020 minimum required contribution. Favorable asset performance of 23.5%, coupled with significant company contributions helped to offset an increase in the benefit obligation due to declining interest rates, improving funded status by four percentage points.","For 2020, we intend to make a total contribution of $193 million. We also expect a significant reduction in pension expense year-over-year by approximately $260 million. Our total projected capital expenditures for 2020 is expected to be $3.3 billion, comprised of $1.7 billion in non-aircraft CapEx and $1.6 billion in aircraft CapEx. With these capital numbers, as Doug said, we currently forecast that we will generate $6 billion in free cash flow over the next two years.","So with that, I will turn it back over to the operator to begin our question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Michael Linenberg","Hey, two questions here and maybe, this is to Derek. I realize that you mentioned with the guidance that it doesn't reflect any sort of benefit from Boeing. But I want to touch on that $6 billion of free cash flow over the next two years because, in the Southwest press release, they did call out $400 million of supplier proceeds that they received in 2019. So, you were talking about the forward guidance. I want to be clear. Does your 2019 number include any sort of benefit, cash benefit from Boeing? And if not, is that potential upside to the $6 billion over the next two years? Anything you can say on that would be great. Thanks.","Derek Kerr","It's hard to talk about any of this because it's a confidential settlement that's out there today. The impact in '20 and '21 where -- is in there from a settlement perspective. But we can't really talk about how we got the settlement and where we got it. We got it over time after things and that's kind of where we are Mike. It's really just because it's a deal with Boeing that we have and it's confidential that we can't really outline where that's at.","But it will -- the Boeing settlement for the $6 billion that we talked about is included in those numbers, so there's no change to that. No upside to that number because of the Boeing settlement unless we talk about a 2020 settlement that's out there that we have not talked about at all. So I guess there's some upside if there's a Boeing settlement on 2020. But I think the '20 -- the settlement we already have is included in that $6 billion number.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. That's actually very helpful. And then just my second question, you haven't made recently any change to your bag fees, what you charge for bag fees. Have you -- I just -- I haven't been able to check.","Derek Kerr","We have not.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Catherine O'Brien","Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. So, question on cost. Your better-than-expected fourth quarter cost performance is due to running a better operation. You talked about some of the milestones you hit on aircraft out of service during the quarter. So, have you extrapolated these better trends into your 2020 CASM guide? Or did you build it on any cushion from an operational performance standpoint? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Derek Kerr","We have an ASM guide at 4% to 6%, so we have assumed a completion factor of 4% to 5%, excuse me. And we have built in a completion factor that we assume that we continue to run the operation that we have today. So that is in play there.","From a CASM perspective, for the full year, the one big headwind that we have is in the maintenance area and it's mostly in engine cost. And some of that is driven by keeping some of the older aircraft around and doing engine hauls on those aircraft -- engine overhauls on those aircraft, due to the fact that the uncertainty on the MAX and some of the delays on the 321 aircraft. So, we have extrapolated in the operation is going to be better. And we have -- but we have -- one of the biggest headwinds is just the maintenance side of things from a cost perspective.","Doug Parker","Hey Kate, this is Doug and I'll just add to that. Again, much like we said that the ASM numbers for the year don't really reflect our plan for the entire year because, again that 4% to 5% will be lower than that before the MAX returns and higher than after. The same holds true for CASM. So, that number can move as return to service dates move. But know this once the return to service date is here, the CASM will be lower than that average number Derek gave. And until it does, they will be somewhat higher than that.","Catherine O'Brien","Okay. Understood. And then a question on the $6 billion in free cash flow you're expecting over the next few years. So approximately how much of that is from sale leaseback proceeds? I know in 2020 that number is $1.5 billion. But what's that figure for 2021? Thank you.","Derek Kerr","Right now it's zero for 2021.","Catherine O'Brien","Understood. Thank you.","Derek Kerr","$1.5 billion is correct for 2020. Zero for 2021.","Catherine O'Brien","Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jose Caiado with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jose Caiado","Hey, thank you very much. Good morning. Robert maybe a question for you. I wanted to ask about the progress on your sub-fleet optimization initiative. I believe you were hoping to take something like 50-or-so different sub fleet combos down to 30 or so. Can you just give us an update on that initiative? I imagine the MAX situation last year maybe delayed the progress there and just how you're thinking about that for 2020.","Robert Isom","Sure. So one of our big projects on the mainline side was to make the configurations on our 321s and our 737 fleets identical. So because of the issues that we ran into last year, of course with the MAX and aircraft out of service we slowed that project down. So to date we plan on reconfiguring a total 304 737s. And I believe that we're \u2013 it changes daily but I believe that we're 80 or so through that.","We've just started on the 321s the 202-or-so aircraft there. So there's a lot more that is coming there. Recall that those configurations not only did they standardize not only did they also add to the total seat count but they also brought great customer amenities such as new lighting, new seats, oversized bins, satellite WiFi and whatnot. So we're really excited about that and getting great feedback from customers on that. We still have in our plan to eliminate the E190s by the end of the summer.","The Super 80s are gone. The 767s will be gone next year. And on the regional side we've done a great job in terms of both rationalizing our fleets in terms of different configurations and also carry partner carriers as well greatly simplifying things. So we're really excited about where we've \u2013 where we started. There's still a lot of upside though as we move forward, especially on the mainline side of things.","Jose Caiado","Thank you for that. And then just a quick second question on your load factor initiatives in 2019. Generally were you pretty satisfied with how the initiative sort of played out? And do you have any plans to make any adjustments to that strategy in 2020? Thanks so much for the time.","Don Casey","Okay. This is Don. Actually we're very, very pleased with how well we executed on our \u2013 what we described as kind of the smartly go load factor, because obviously our objective is not to maximize load factor but to maximize revenue. And we had over the course of 2019 issued record load factors. It was the highest load factor the company has ever had in its history.","And as we look at where we grew because that's really the most important part, we were able to find the right places in order to be able to push the load factor out. As we look forward into 2020, we still think there is a little bit of opportunity as we look back to fine-tune what we did in 2019. So I think a bit more upside going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning, everybody. First one for Derek a similar question, well actually identical to what I asked from United yesterday. Could you talk about the evolution of the $4 to $6 guide and the timing of when that forecast really did come together, the degree to which it was influenced by some of the recent geopolitical uncertainty? Also clearly a foregoing conclusion that you're going to have to push the June reentry schedule, should we anticipate updated annual metrics when that happens?","Doug Parker","Jamie I'll take that on a broad one. If you need more Derek can give you more example. And to your question when was it \u2013 when do we come that it was last night. So it incorporates everything we know at this point in time, everything we anticipate at this point in time. And our \u2013 certainly our objective is not to amend it other than to maybe be amending it upwards we had hoped maybe at some point in time. Because everything we see right now are really what we anticipate right now. And to the extent that changes of course we would update it at that time. But anything we know now is in there. And to the extent unanticipated issues come up we'll work very hard to offset those, so we don't have to adjust it. But it's \u2013 all those things you mentioned are incorporated in that.","Jamie Baker","And just to drill down no accruals for any \u2013 no unique contract assumptions that are in the guide.","Doug Parker","I'm sorry.","Jamie Baker","No labor accruals or assumptions on your behalf as part of the guide just want to make sure.","Doug Parker","Yes. I want to make sure I said it's right again. It includes everything we anticipate at this time. We know where we are in labor negotiations. What we anticipate is included in that so...","Jamie Baker","Okay. Excellent. And a follow-up on labor Doug. I wanted to ask about the bench. I was impressed to see the hire of Brian on Vasu's team. I think there has been some surprise amongst investors that there haven't been, how should I say this more gyrations in terms of the overall bench. I want to ask the question in a way that you're comfortable asking or answering, excuse me. You could answer my question with a question if you want. I guess I'll ask it this way. Was Brian a one-off? Or would you say that you are actively looking to pick up new talent where needed throughout the organization?","Doug Parker","Yeah. We're always actively looking to pick-up new talent throughout the organization. We've been doing so for quite some time. That's one case. There have been several over the years, and they've been some of the best additions to the team. It's one of the really nice things actually from my perspective of the transformation that's happened. American and in this industry, there was a time it was difficult to attract good people that are -- that were already in the business.","But we've -- who we are and what we can do now, I mean might get us -- just look at -- if you -- you apparently haven't or we haven't been prominent enough in pointing out to you the kinds of people we have been adding such as our General Counsel with a phenomenal resume in the division. We have people we've added over the last two years from firms like this, memory now, IBM, PepsiCo, Walmart, JPMorgan, Starwood, Texas Instruments, that have all come to this organization and had made a huge difference, and we'll continue to do so.","So we'll keep doing that, and we do it throughout the organization. Those people are all throughout the organization. We feel fantastic about the team we have in place, the structure we have in place, and the bench strength we have in place. We're -- what we -- but we always are looking to improve. And are -- as you know, we're excited about the hire as you noted, and there are more to come as there always will be and really excited about we have in place.","Jamie Baker","Excellent. Strong answer. Thank you, Doug. Take care.","Doug Parker","Thanks. Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Doug Parker","Hi, Hunter.","Hunter Keay","Hey. Hey, Doug, everybody. Doug, a bit of an offbeat question, but the way you were talking about the shareholders sort of feeling the impact of the MAX delays in your prepared remarks, it kind of just dawned on me. It wouldn't one way to soften that might be cutting a special dividend of about $5 per share to your shareholders using Boeing money to make up for how much your stock price has gone down since the MAX was grounded? Is that something you would consider?","Doug Parker","Jamie, here's how we think about -- I'm sorry -- every time. I swear I'm not doing it for -- I swear I'm not doing it for. ","Hunter Keay","Every time.","Doug Parker","All right. All right -- right now. But I do it to each one of you. So anyway, Hunter, sorry. Look this -- we view this settlement as we do all cash proceeds and cash flow generated by the company it goes in order. First to invest in the business make sure we're doing that. Next to make sure we're paying down any debt either that is expensive, which we don't have any of that or as it comes due and we don't need to add more to do that. And then having done those things invest in the company and make sure we're paying down debt as prudent. And then make sure we have sufficient amount on hand to ensure that we have -- as we do an extremely large cash balance ought to be prepared to be ready for any sort of black swan event that might happen.","So we make sure we always have at least $7 billion of liquidity in hand. So you know all that. And then having done all that the excess, we do look to return to shareholders. We've been aggressive about that in the past. We'll be in the future. We believe with where the stock is -- when we believe the stock is undervalued, we think the best way to return that to the shareholders is to repurchase some shares. From those who are not as -- we're not as -- don't have as much of a strong view on the future as others might. We think that's the best way to return to shareholders not through dividends. So that's how we'll treat these proceeds as well.","Hunter Keay","Okay. That's fair. Thanks. And then, as I look at the headcount over the last few years, I'm curious Derek how attrition rates have impacted that relative to what your baseline plan was at the time of the merger. Obviously labor rates have gone up. And folks who don't have mandatory retirement ages, are probably hanging on a little bit longer to make up for lost pensions and things like that. So how has attrition impacted headcount? And is that something -- is that an area that's been a little bit worse than expected relative to your baseline sort of merger cost outlook? And is there anything that can be done about that going forward? Thanks.","Derek Kerr","I wouldn't say it's any -- we're different than what's expected. I mean from attrition rates have definitely gone down because of the salaries within the industry. So at certain areas where there were high attrition, it's gone down a fair amount. But we're managing that. That just means we're not hiring as many people in those areas than we have. So I'm not concerned about where we're at.","I think we're efficient. We're going to become more efficient over time. There might be some opportunities that we will go after over the next few years. But as we go forward, I think we look at that all the time. But attrition really hasn't impacted it. That's really lowered hiring and lowered where we needed to be from a hiring standpoint.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey. Good morning. Thank you.","Doug Parker","Hey, Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Just revisiting the fourth quarter a little bit and I apologize if this is overly simplistic. But you grew below 3% you had the benefit of Dallas hub growth. Competitors had fleet limitations, which limited their ability to grow and inflated their non-fuel costs. You were in a seasonally stronger period and yet revenue came in softer versus your initial guide. And so, again maybe overly simplistic, but if you can't find price on 3% growth, how are investors supposed to get comfortable that you can find it on 5-plus to offset inflationary pressures on the business longer term? And more importantly, how are you going to evaluate if that aspirational growth rate is working as we proceed maybe in the back half of this year?","Don Casey","Okay. This is \u2013 Duane, this is Don Casey talking. So if you could just look at kind of what our guide was our guide was to have TRASM up, I think at 1 point in the fourth quarter. We ended up 0.5 point. Two-tenths of that was we had more ASMs in the quarter because of better completion factor. We're down about three-tenths. When you do look at the numbers that we have, you have to remember this is the kind of the last quarter, but we have this headwind related to frequent flyer recognition is about nine-tenths a point. So when you kind of back that and look at our numbers, we actually did I think pretty well relative to everybody else. Probably more importantly is as we look forward into the second quarter, particularly in the domestic market, we actually see the domestic market looking pretty robust as we head forward \u2013 look forward. So in every forward month right now our yields, which were a bit soft in the fourth quarter, because of the performance in November all look positive, right? So we're pretty actually optimistic about our forward outlook.","And again, as you think about the fourth quarter really the only thing that was off track for us was November. We did better in December than we expected. We did better in October than we expected. But November with the extra week of trough that last week before Thanksgiving for us was very, very weak. But beyond that, everything really performed really at or above expectations. And again, the forward look in terms of forward deals is positive.","Doug Parker","And Bob on the growth...","Vasu Raja","Yeah. Hey, Duane, this is Vasu. I'll just add something to Don's comments too in that the manner in which we've taken out the MAX in the past and the way we're taking it out in the first quarter and second quarter is different, right? Until this point in time certainly in fourth quarter and third quarter before that we were taking the MAX out sometimes 60 or 75 days before the flights flew. So, what we are effectively doing is we had already filled up capacity and we had fewer seats available for higher-yielding last-minute bookings. And so you can see it certainly stands to reason. You see it in the industry data that there has been a huge transfer of share from carriers that operate the MAX to carriers that don't operate the MAX and we saw that in the fourth quarter. But despite that as we look forward, we have been \u2013 actually, we've taken it out further in advance. And so that enables us to go and revenue manage the airline to a more predictable capacity base.","But also in fourth quarter, despite the very obvious frustrations we have with the MAX one thing that is encouraging as we think about bringing the MAX back is as we took the MAX out we sought to preserve the connecting power of our three biggest hubs; Chicago, DFW and Charlotte. And so even though we saw net traffic loss across our system in those three hubs we actually both saw traffic gain. And most critically, we saw share gains of the highest value O&Ds in the domestic system. This is encouraging to us of course, because when the MAX comes back, the marginal cost of bringing that airplane back is miniscule. Indeed, we're carrying it right now. But we believe the marginal RASMs will be certainly uniquely high for us, because so much of what the MAX will do is provide more seats on those higher-value O&Ds that are at the highest percentiles of our domestic yield curves.","Don Casey","Yeah. This is Don again. Just add one more point. If you look at where the MAX capacity effect is it's really domestic. That's where we actually have the impact. It grew domestically only by 1.2% in the fourth quarter. We expect it to grow a lot more. And domestic has the far and away the highest nominal PRASMs, so it hasn't taken important impact on us in terms of fourth quarter unit revenue.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks for that detail. And just for a quick follow-up Derek, the lower pension expense ratable across the quarters. And would you be willing to disclose the actual pension expense in 2020 versus 2019? Thanks for taking the questions.","Derek Kerr","It is ratable throughout the quarters. And the 260 number is the number that is going to be the expense this year.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Doug, I guess given that this is the start of a new year, I just wanted to ask you a bigger-picture question. And then, I don't mean to be combative but since 2014 the first year following the merger your pre-tax income has declined by about 30%, a little over $1 billion. I know the MAX creates some hardship, but United and Southwest who are both MAX operators have grown pre-tax over that period. Neither one of those carriers has a significantly larger operational footprint than you, and neither has a single hub that's bigger than either of your two largest at DFW and Charlotte as they currently exist. So I guess the question with all respect and without reference to the MAX or the need for more capacity, what do you think the one to two things are that you've done wrong since the merger? And what are the one or two things that you think you need to do differently in 2020 to show investors that you can reverse the downward earnings trend?","Doug Parker","Yeah. Let me \u2013 let me answer it this way by \u2013 first by noting \u2013 look one, we agree. We know of course that \u2013 let's just talk about this as the margin gap. We fully recognize that our relative \u2013 our margins relative to our two largest competitors have \u2013 that gap has gone from being positive to American to negative to American or to the extent it was positive \u2013 if Delta was positive, which was more positive of late. And we're concerned about that and certainly intent on reversing the trend. Further to explain most of what you described from 2014 on part of our large margin relative margin performance was the fact that as we took two airlines one US Airways, which has lower labor costs than the big three; and then American which has lower labor costs than those two airlines as it went through a bankruptcy, a large part of that margin advantage was unsustainable.","We certainly \u2013 I think we're quite clear about that at the time that we were going to need to overtime as we sign new contracts get our teams wages and benefits in line with those and that's happened. So that's certainly a part of it. But that's not \u2013 but having said that, that's not always what we're going on. So let me just say it this way. As we sit here today having just closed these years out that gap, I mean, I don't know what \u2013 what the line you look at, I don\u2019t know generally people look at pre-tax we get somewhat hurt on that of course, but the fact that we've gone and invested in $20 billion of new aircraft for the last five years that those airlines haven't done yet. So that's about a point of it. So a way to adjust for that is to look -- but anyway the trends are much the same. I'm not trying to blame it on that. But I think a better way to look at it is with the EBITDAR margin. And again the story is exactly the same.","You look at the EBITDAR margins for the year just ended we're going to -- we come out a little less than two points behind United for the year and about six points behind Delta. So I look at those and think that doesn't seem right. We should -- there's no reason that American Airlines should have margins that are lower than United. There may be a structural reason at this point in time that we would be lower than Delta as United is. That structural reason being that they had so much of their capacity flying in and out of really, really profitable hubs. But we're not -- I'm not trying to say that there's some structural reason that can't be closed but it may not be able to be closed in the really near-term. As we end up growing Dallas and Charlotte over time in our network I think that can be closed. But I suspect you're talking more near-term. So in the near-term here's what I think.","We have one more of these contracts to do. That's in -- that's one more to actually get our labor costs in line. We have one more joint collective bargain agreement to get done. That will happen in 2020. Once we do that you will then be at a point where our labor costs in general across the border largely in line with theirs so you won't see that continued kind of pressure. So, as we look to 2020 we have that headwind, but what I believe is because of all the things we have going on that we'll close that gap. The 2020 margin again, let's set the MAX side for whatever that does to this year's earnings what we will then be compensated for.","But just looking at adjusted for the MAX, I think, our margins this year will be despite that headwind in line or hopefully maybe in a little better than those two carriers. Year-over-year improvement I'm saying. So while we may not be able to start closing it in 2020 because we have to get that last contract there within there and having done that we will then have labor costs that are now largely the same as our competitors. Well to the extent labor costs go up at any of our airlines it will go up at all of the airlines at a better or similar amount. So -- and as that happens, I think, right now is we expect that margin gap to be closed.","How much how fast? Hard to say. Conservatively, I think, we should easily be able to get one point here. So again let's for 2020 assume that we not only get that point, but we stay where we are in the gap. And then a couple more years we're at or near United and then -- and then over three years ahead of United and -- or by one point or so and closing that and having that gap and half again still. That's -- that I believe is what you'll see from us from all the initiatives that we've been laying out over time. They're working now.","Despite all that is going on and the headwinds we've had we did indeed have margin expansion year-over-year. We had this quarter our fourth quarter margin improvement for the first time in two years was -- didn't that -- the improvement was better than United for the first time in two years. I don't want to make a big deal about that because it's not that much but it's not that much improved and it's one quarter and it's the last quarter of the year so -- who knows. But that's a fact.","It was the first time in two years that we've seen our margin gap versus United start to narrow albeit at a small rate. We hope that's the beginning of a trend. Certainly, I think, that should be -- like I say once we get this last contract in place going forward. So that's where we're headed. That happens by the way without -- if you ask me, what do we need to do about that? I believe we've been -- I believe we explained all that. Again if you want more Robert and Don can do it again. It's largely revenue and its revenue initiatives things like getting our -- the entire fleet harmonized things like getting our ability to sell up in the same position than some of our competitors are things that we know we can and will do and it will allow our revenues to increase at a rate or again our revenues to increase at a rate and our profits to increase at a rate that they don't have the opportunity to do.","So that's what I think. I know it's a long answer but it's a really important question that we get a lot and that's what I believe. It's -- that margin gap is not something we believe is acceptable, not something we believe will be sustained and one that you should continue to hold our feet to the fire as we move forward.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thank you very much Doug for the answer.","Doug Parker","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. Thanks. Doug I just want to highlight that. I mean you do refer to kind of the competitive disadvantage that you face in some cases. You guys have an enormous competitive advantage over United in particular related to the credit card program. That I think needs to be considered. But my question is, when you look out over the next couple of years in the $6 billion in free cash flow how much of that do you expect to return to shareholders versus going to pay down debt or the pension? Like what's the actual number that you see being free to return?","Doug Parker","Yes. Before I answer that I just want to respond to your comment. Nothing that I said we have disadvantages to United nothing. We're not saying any reason that we think we shouldn't have margins at or better than United. And I agree with you our credit card program is an advantage. That's one of the reasons that there shouldn't -- what I said was we may have a structural disadvantage on the network front versus Delta today. So anyway that's what I tried to say.","The -- as to your question on how much of that free cash flow gets to investors I'll refer back to my comments which were as follows. We said that we expect over the next two years free cash flow of $6 billion. And we also said that we expected to reduce our total adjusted debt by $3 billion to $4 billion. Again, so that's -- there's a couple of billion dollars there. And again all else equal would be excess of the $7 billion. And with -- again consistent with our past behavior and our views about our obligation to our shareholders, I would expect if I was modeling that that would be returned to shareholders.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then if the MAX reduced 2019 pretax by $550 million, the mechanics was another few hundred million. Can you just help us understand how much of an impact that's expected to be in 2020? If things are getting better and the operation is getting better and there's revenue momentum then why shouldn't the baseline for 2020 be 2019 results plus the MAX and the mechanics impacts? I guess how much of those factors are reduced? How much are those reducing the first quarter 2020 guidance by? Can you just maybe help us understand that? Thank you.","Doug Parker","Yes, sure. Yes, thanks. Look the MAX is still an issue in 2020. So -- and when we say we expect to be back, obviously we have our June date and -- but that we're going to need to reassess that. So some time late summer early fall, let's assume that's going to be at about the same number of months in 2020 as it was in 2019. So the MAX effect on financials, there's no positive impact in those numbers. I do want to make this -- take the time to make this point, whatever that amount is we will be compensated. That -- Boeing has been clear about that. They've shown that they're -- they will do that. It is unfortunate that the accounting for that doesn't match the period in which the pain happens. But it's real value. It's value that accrues to our shareholders and we are committed to ensuring that we receive that value for you on your behalf on our behalf.","So that -- again those -- I would just ask all of you as you look to those kind of large impacts of the Boeing impact to understand that those are -- that's an accounting issue in large part, at least again for financial purposes. It's a huge obviously issue for our customers and our team. But other than that, as it relates to the financials, that amount our shareholders will be compensated for. It just won't be -- it just won't be accounted for in the current period. Point one. So that's my answers to how much is the MAX. So that leaves you with the other piece, which is the operating issues we had this year.","Certainly, there's upside to that. We -- as I mentioned, we have some -- we have another headwind which is the contract which caused -- the contract negotiations which were related to that issue will result in -- what we really want to get happen make happen with this contract for our fleet service and maintenance team. That will lead to an increase in our costs.","So on a year-over-year basis I think those things certainly don't have a huge positive. It's certainly not a positive impact. I'll say it's one versus the other. But having said all that, I go back to where -- what we said which is knowing everything we know at this point we gave you an EPS estimate that we believe is our best estimate of where we are at this point incorporating all.","Joseph DeNardi","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Parker","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Dan McKenzie","Yeah. Thanks for the time guys. With respect to the $7 billion liquidity target, what's the debt profile that you'd like to see before you draw that down? So if there's $3 billion to $4 billion less debt in two years, what liquidity target might accompany that?","Doug Parker","Yes, it's a good question, Dan. I don't have all the answers specifically, but you raised a good point. That number is based upon -- we work with -- again there is science, but at the end of the day it's -- there's some art as well. But the science is going and working with some outside investment bankers and running all sorts kind of Monte Carlo simulation worst case make sure under any sort of difficult situation that we have more than enough to handle that. Those simulations run with less debt will result in a lower cash balance required. They're not doing it yet. When they do, we'll continue to look at it.","But it's a fair -- but anyway, you raise a good point. I look forward to the day that that's the question we're getting from all of our shareholders which is \"Why are you holding so much of the cash.\" But right now, we believe it's prudent. But there will -- I certainly expect as we produce the kind of cash flow we suggested and use it to pay down debt that there will come a time in the future that we'll -- that number will come down somewhat.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. Okay.","Doug Parker","Thanks.","Dan McKenzie","Sure. And then next question here, Don or Vasu, I think you've been really clear that the growth is focused where you're strong. But as you look at where you're strong, you look at where you're weak, how do you get more critical mass in the markets where you're weak? So I guess the question is, could an expanded codeshare domestically be a good solution? And then kind of separate to that question, I'm just wondering just given the Atlantic RASM headwind, I'm just wondering if you could just -- as a housecleaning question just sort of comment on when you think that that might reverse?","Vasu Raja","Hey, Dan, this is Vasu. Let me start and then Don and others can pick up. Actually let me take the second question first and then I'll do the first one. So there's certainly a foreign exchange impact in fourth quarter transatlantic RASM. But one of the things -- and we've talked about this for a long time. Certainly, I have is that as we go and shrink the number of subfleets, we're turning 767s into 787s. So in the old days of both AMR and US Airways, we could go into the winters when demand was lower and simply idle wide-bodies or widen in the domestic system or things like that. The ownership of those things was very different.","So one of the things which we've been doing increasingly is going and extending fourth quarter flying on our wide-bodies. And the RASMs are down. We've been really pleased with the marginal earnings from it, right? Of course, we -- the cost of operating a 787 flying Chicago to Barcelona in the winter is maybe -- it's very, very small respectively just the incremental cost of the fuel burn on the thing. But what we're seeing on it are marginal RASMs that are in the 75% to 80% range of or otherwise flying in transatlantic.","And so that's been a really positive development for us. Indeed over time not that long ago the airline didn't make money flying transatlantic in the winter and now we make money transatlantic all 12 months of the year and we see opportunities to go and do more. And so though we see this near-term RASM challenge is backed up by something, which is a really promising sign for future earnings and future network development.","And then to your earlier point about places where we're relatively strong or relatively weaker. Look it remains to be seen. The more critical point is that in the places where we're strong and certainly in markets like in the Midwest, the Southeast, Florida things like that the Southwest, we -- every chance we've had to grow it we have been seeing that the marginal earnings off of that growth has been really attractive. Indeed it -- though it is obscured with any number of other things going on we see opportunities to be able to grow earnings primarily by being able to do that organically in the near term.","Don Casey","This is Don. I'll just talk just about the Atlantic. Just the way our joint business kind of we settle out revenues at the end of the year, we didn't have a three-point headwind on the Atlantic, which we can not really relate it to the kind of performance. You back that out our performance is basically right in line with Delta and United. So I think we're all seeing the same thing which is a pretty stable business demand and demand for premium products that have pretty aggressive pricing at this point in the coacher.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Yeah. Thanks for the time.","Doug Parker","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.","Alison Sider","Hi. Thanks so much.","Doug Parker","Hi, Ali.","Alison Sider","I was wondering if you could share if there's any sort of thinking that you have right now? I know there's a lot of uncertainty, but any contingency plans for a much longer-term grounding? If this were to continue past mid-year through the end of the year or even longer kind of what kind of things would you do differently? Does that feel like it's a possibility? Is it something you're kind of gaming out already?","Doug Parker","Ali, we aren't at this point. We are running our airline today without the MAX in service. And if we're going to be out longer than we anticipate we will continue to do the same things. We're not going to have our strategy dictated by when this airplane comes or doesn't come. We know it will fly again someday. When it does we'll be ready.","In the meantime, we're going to keep focusing on running a great operation making sure that where we are growing that we're growing where we can be profitable, and making sure we're generating some free cash flow. But when the FAA side of the aircraft is ready to fly, we'll be ready -- we will make -- we'll be ready to get our pods training at the aircraft back up. We're looking forward to that. But until that time, we'll keep doing exactly what we're doing. And don't have any plans beyond trying to figure out what happens after that or before that.","Alison Sider","Got it. Thanks. And do you expect a simulator training requirement to sort of create a lot of new delays or slow down the return to service process when it eventually comes?","Doug Parker","Go ahead, Rob.","Robert Isom","Yeah. We're working really closely with the FAA in trying to make sure that there's all the information is built into our planning. From what we know right now we know that there's going to be simulator -- 737 MAX simulator training required. We are sketching out a number of different scenarios. And in all of those we've made sure that American is sufficiently staffed with resources simulators, and also training resources to make sure that we can get the aircraft back up as soon as possible once the FAA and once our pilots and Boeing say the aircraft ready to go.","Alison Sider","Thanks.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Your line is now open.","Doug Parker","Hi, Dawn.","Dawn Gilbertson","Hi. Hey, how are you? My question has to do with the coronavirus, but are kind of on three fronts. I know it's early, but are you guys seeing any booking impact at all? Have you contemplated any travel waivers for the region? And lastly, maybe this one is for Robert. What measures is American taking to protect passengers and crew?","Robert Isom","Thanks Dawn. So first off, we haven't -- it's too soon to see any impact. Our network isn't that extensive in Asia. But we're on top of it. We're working with CBP, the CDC and public health officials as well as our medical resources here to make sure that we're following all best practices.","We're doing that with an intent to make sure that we take care of our customers and team members. We've seen viruses in the past that we've had to make accommodations for and to be prepared for. We're doing all those same things right now. And we're going to watch it and make sure that we take aggressive action if there is a need to.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is now open.","Leslie Josephs","Hi. Good morning everybody. On the MAX, how has the grounding affected your hiring plans for this year and going forward? And when do you expect to be fully over the issues with the MAX considering or thinking if Boeing's forecast for midyear FAA ground lifting holds? Thanks.","Robert Isom","So, we know -- we're confident that the MAX will come back. And we plan for the future. And as we take a look out into that future and where we will be later in 2020, assuming the aircraft comes back in late summer or early fall or even out into 2021. We are planning and making sure that we're ready to accommodate those aircraft.","The planning cycle for pilots is a lengthy one. And so we actually have to start hiring 12 months or more in advance. Not only to handle growth, but also to handle the hundreds of pilots that are, now retiring out of American.","We feel really good about that pilot pipeline. We're going to make its -- our pilots are our best asset. And we do a great job in going out and hiring and recruiting the best of the best and making sure that they're always trained and ready to go.","So, we're planning well in advance. We have sufficient number of pilots. And right now we're not making any changes to that plan.","Leslie Josephs","Thanks. And then, the other question is about the hold MAX issue. When do you expect to have your 76? Has Boeing given you any guidance on that? And when do you expect this whole thing to resolve?","Does Boeing forecast for the grounding is lifted in the middle of the year. And you have the plane by let's say like late summer, early fall?","Robert Isom","So right now, all we can tell you is that we know that we have 24 owned aircraft. And that once the ungrounding is lifted we're ready to go with those. As I mentioned, there's a number of aircraft that have also been produced.","We're hopeful that those would be some of the first that could be released. But then in terms of future production, we don't know. And so, we'll continue to work very closely with Boeing, once the aircraft is ungrounded.","And we're hopeful to get delivery and back to the levels of flying that we had intended originally.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. Thanks. And then, so, no reduction in hiring of pilots or cabin crews, because of the MAX issues?","Robert Isom","No.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Slotnick with Business Insider. Your line is now open.","David Slotnick","Hi. How are you? Thanks for taking my question. I know that you have resolved the worst part of the labor issues that you were experiencing last spring and into the summer. I just wondered if you had any update on contract negotiations with mechanics and pilot teams.","Doug Parker","They continue. The National Mediation Board is overseeing those negotiations. We recently restarted again after the New Year. They continue. And that's the update. The -- we have -- all parties have agreed at the NMB's request not to discuss those negotiations. Other than that -- and that's been productive thus far so we'll abide by that.","David Slotnick","Got you, thanks and just quickly, I know you were talking about the partnership and codeshare Qantas earlier. Have you seen any impact because of the fires? Or has it really been too soon for that?","Robert Isom","Don, do you want to talk about that?","Don Casey","Yeah, yeah, so we have started. We've expanded the codeshare with Qantas. So right now I think it's still in the early stages. In terms of performance, obviously, we when we look at the Australian market, we've seen over the last -- really started about three weeks ago a bit of a softening in terms of U.S. demand. But overall, I think, we're very happy with the progress, we're making with Qantas right now.","David Slotnick","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Edward Russell with The Points Guy. Your line is now open.","Edward Russell","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the fleet plans with the continued MAX grounding. I see, you're continuing with the E190 retirements.","And I don't see any other modifications to the fleet plan to address the fact that the MAXs won't be back in the sky until at least the summer.","Is American considering holding on to the 190s? Or any other measures to make sure that you can continue to grow to the MAX?","Robert Isom","Edward, right now the 190s are scheduled to go out at the end of the summer. That's the game plan. That's the way we've built the airline. We will make adjustments based on what we hear from Boeing and the actual time lines as they become more firm.","But right now, we anticipate the MAX coming back late summer, early fall. And we're preparing our airline to that end.","Edward Russell","Okay. And is it also correct then since the retrofits of the 321s and the 737s are going to move forward this -- in the new this year on schedule? I know they were postponed last year due to the MAX.","Robert Isom","Yeah. So from the original schedule, we're probably a year behind. But as we take a look into the year we will have -- we restarted the 737 line. We have the 321 prototype done as well. And we will have a critical mass. I don't know the exact number that we'll have done by next summer, but, its 115...","Don Casey","All the 738s will be done by April of 2021. And then all the 321s will be done by May of 2022. And we're going to keep the line going at the entire time. We're not going to pull the line because of the delay in the MAXs this year. We're going to keep it moving.","Edward Russell","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Doug Parker for any closing remarks.","Doug Parker","Thank you all very much. We appreciate your interest. And if you have any questions please let us know. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

And welcome to the American Airlines First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Cravens, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Dan Cravens","Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for our question-and-answer session are several of our senior exes, including Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs, Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.","Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the first quarter and provide some additional information on our 2019 guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions, and then lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please do limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast or capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and that can also be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website, the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us. At this point, I\u2019d like to the turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Dan. And thank you all for being on the line. I need to start by thanking our 130,000 team members for the outstanding job they did of taking care of our customers and each other during some really difficult circumstances. Robert, we'll talk more about disruption. The 737 MAX issue is caused to our customers and team members, but our team has responded remarkably and our customers and our shareholders are the beneficiaries of that work, so we are extremely grateful.","As your earnings we announced this morning pre-tax results from the quarter of $314 million in profits ex specials, which is $0.52 a share. As we head into or begin to prepare for the peak summer travel season, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, demand for our product is high.","Our near-term forecast though has been up - has been affected by the 737 MAX grounding, which we currently estimate will negatively impact. Our 2019 pre-tax results by approximately $350 million and that assumes they were - they are flying as we currently have them scheduled again by August 19.","And the recent bounceback in oil prices hasn't helped either. Our current estimate for 2019 fuel expense is approximately $650 million higher than it was when we spoke on this call just three months ago.","But despite these challenges, we're still - anticipate our 2019 EPS to increase approximately 10% versus 2018. And as we look to 2020 and beyond we anticipate our free cash flow for production will increase significantly, as our historic fleet replacement program winds down.","So we're really bullish on American Airlines and on AAL as ever is - evidence in the quarter by us purchasing approximately $600 million of American Airlines equity. So with that intro, I am going to turn it over to Derek to go through a lot more the numbers and then Robert will take you through more analysis as well. Derek?","Derek Kerr","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning everyone. And before I begin I'd like to recognize our team also who did a great job taking care of our customers during the quarter despite a number of challenges, including a government shut down, challenging storms at are largest hubs and obviously the grounding of our 737 MAX fleet, dealing with these issues has not been easy and they\u2019ve done it with professionalism and commitment. So from all of us, thank you for all of your efforts.","We filed our first quarter 2019 earnings press release this morning, excluding net special items we reported a first quarter net profit of $237 million, this is versus $353 million in the first quarter of 2018.","Our diluted earnings per share, excluding special items in the first quarter was $0.52 per share, down from $0.74 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018. Our first quarter 2019 pre-tax profit excluding net special items was $314 million resulting in a pre-tax margin of 3%.","Before I give more details on our financial performance, I'd like to provide an update on our fleet. As you are aware on March 7, 2019 we announced the unplanned removal of 14 737 800 aircraft from service for remediation work, following the installation of new aircraft interiors, resulting in the cancellation of approximately 940 flights in the quarter. Work on these aircraft has been completed and all aircraft have been returned to service.","In addition on March 13th, 2019 the FAA grounded all U.S. registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Our fleet currently includes 24 Boeing Max 8 aircraft with an additional 76 aircraft on order. As a result of the grounding we canceled approximately 12 hundred flights in the first quarter. In aggregate we estimate that these groundings - grounded aircraft and associated flight cancellations negatively impacted first quarter pre-tax income by approximately $80 million, 50 of that million is attributed to the MAX.","We have now removed all 737 MAX flying from our schedule through August 19th resulting in the cancellation of approximately 115 flights per day or approximately 2% percent of debate daily capacity during the summer period. Although these aircraft represent a small portion of the company's total fleet, the financial impact is disproportionate as most of the revenue from the cancellations is lost, while the vast majority of the costs remain in place.","In total, we presently estimate that 737 MAX cancellations which we assume right now will extend only through August 19th to impact our 2019 pre-tax earnings by approximately $350 million dollars.","Despite the challenges of our fleet, our total revenues were a record for the first quarter at $10.6 billion or a 1.8% increase over the first quarter of 2018. Our total RASM was up for the 10th consecutive quarter as RASM increased 0.5% to $15.87, also a record for the first quarter.","This revenue growth was driven in part by the continued success of our basic and premium economy products, as well as initiatives to drive higher load factors in the shoulder periods, all of which helped grow passenger revenues by 1.95 to $9.7 billion in the first quarter.","Our cargo yields grew by 5.5% for the quarter, but a reduction in available cargo capacity due to reductions in our flying to China and Latin America meant that cargo revenues were down 4% to $218 million.","Our loyalty program continues to drive revenue growth and other revenues were higher by 1.9% to $708 million for the quarter on higher card acquisitions. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were $10.2 billion, up 2 percent when fuel and special items are excluded, our unit costs increase in the first quarter by 2.7% compared to 2018, due primarily to increased maintenance expense, contractual increases in salaries and benefits, facility rents and depreciation and amortization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $7.2 billion in total available liquidity, so far this year our treasury team has completed a number of transactions, including securing financing for 30 new aircraft through mortgage and sale leaseback transactions.","With the exception - with the exception of three regional aircraft delivering in the fourth quarter we have committed financing for all aircraft deliveries through 2019 and we have committed financing for 25 of our 2020 deliveries. We continue to evaluate financing options for our remaining mainline and regional aircraft deliveries.","We made contributions of $364 million to our defined benefit pension plans in the first quarter for 2019 we still expect total contributions for the year to be approximately $800 million. Driven by strong asset performance in the first quarter we estimated that the funding status of our plans has improved by over $300 million as of March 31 compared to year end or approximately 380 basis points.","In the first quarter, our debt including pensions continued to decline driven by contributions to our pension plans and through debt amortization. We continue to expect that our 2019 year end debt \u2013 were compared to year in 2018. As the elevated CapEx associated with our re-fleeting [ph] program ends after this year, we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.","We remain committed to returning cash above our target liquidity to shareholders, as market conditions merit. During the first quarter we repurchased 16.7 million shares for $600 million bringing our share count to 444 million, a 41% decline in the share count since the merger in 2013. Our available authorization for stock buybacks is now 1.1 billion and expires at the end of 2020.","We filed our investor update this morning, which include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019 Due to the ongoing impact of the grounding of our MAX fleet, we now anticipate capacity growth of approximately 2.5% for the full year and approximately 0.7% in the second quarter. While lower than our original plan this capacity growth will still allow us to fully execute our growth plans at our DFW hub which will be the primary driver of our ASM growth for the rest of the year.","For the full year we now expect that our 2019 cost per ASM, excluding fuel special items and new labor deals will grow by approximately 2.5%, driven primarily by increases in maintenance expenses, higher regional costs due to volume of flying, higher airport rent expense and contractual salary and benefit increases. This 50 basis point increase from previous gains is solely due to the reduction in ASM growth that I mentioned earlier.","Due to lower ASMs in the second and third quarters, we now expect that our CASM will increase by approximately 4.5% in a - in the in the second quarter with growth of approximately 3% in the third quarter, fourth quarter guidance remains unchanged at approximately a 0.5%.","Fuel price increases - increased sharply during the first quarter of 2019. We are forecasting that our average fuel price will be between $2.14 and $2.19 per gallon for the second quarter of 2019 and $2.13 to $2.18 for the full year. Our anticipated consolidated fuel expense for the full year is now approximately $650 million dollars higher than our expectations at the start of the year.","For revenue we expect that our total revenue per ASM will grow by between 1% and 3% in the second quarter. Robert will provide more detail on the revenue environment in his remarks. But given the cost guidance I outlined above, we expect that our second quarter pre-tax margin, excluding that special items will be between 7% and 8 \u2013 7% and 9%. Had we not had the impact of the mass cancellations on the second quarter, we would have forecasted year over year margin expansion.","Due to the impact of the grounding of our MAX, which is fleet - which is about $0.60 per diluted share and the significant increase in fuel expense for the full year which is about a $1.25 per share, we now anticipate that are our earnings per diluted share excluding special items will be between $4 and $6 per share in 2019, an increase of approximately 10% at the midpoint over our 2018 adjusted earnings per share. We still anticipate that we will see margins expansion in the back half of the year.","We continue to anticipate an incremental $1 billion in revenue improvements and $300 million in cost reductions from a one airline cost initiatives in 2019. However with fuel expenses where it is currently forecasted for the remainder of the year we plan to take another look at all of our initiatives and our growth plan \u2013 at our planned growth in the second half of the year in 2020.","We have revised our expectations for aircraft CapEx in 2019 which now anticipate it will be $2.7 billion, down from $3 billion in previous guidance, due primarily to the late delivery of 5 A321 neo aircraft that will now be received in 2020.","As a result of the delay of the neo deliveries into 2020, total CapEx will now expect it to be $4.4 billion in 2019, $3.6 billion in 2020 and remain unchanged in 2021 at $2.2 billion.","So far 2019 has presented some unexpected challenges, but our team has responded admirably to take care of our customers and each other. We are excited by the opportunities we have to grow our business for the rest of 2019 and beyond. And we look forward to executing on all of our plans.","With that, I will turn it over to Robert.","Robert Isom","Thanks, Derek and good morning everyone. Before I begin I'd like to thank our team members for doing a great job of taking care of our customers. Their dedication and commitment to delivering outstanding customer service was a crucial component in our ability to generate record first quarter revenues. This was no easy task, particularly given the challenges we faced with our fleet and weather.","As we prepare for summer, our focus is around planning for the busiest travel period of the year. And as Derek mentioned, on April 14th we made the decision to extend the cancellations of our Boeing 737 MAX aircraft through August 19th.","Our team has done a remarkable job of taking care of our customers and it's been a real challenge given the magnitude of this disruption. For flights through August 19th, we have had to re accommodate almost 700,000 customers, 700,000 customers from almost 150,000 MAX cancellations.","And it's not just our passengers. It's literally thousands of our crew members that have had their work schedules altered on very short notice. And that means that our reservations, customer relations and crew resources teams have been working non-stop and overtime to take care of our customers and team. So again, from all of us to our colleagues, thank you.","Based upon our ongoing work with the FAA and Boeing, we are confident that the MAX will be recertified prior to August 19th. But by extending our cancellations through the summer, we can plan more reliably for the peak travel season and provide confidence to our customers and team members that we will operate our planned schedule.","Once the MAX is recertified, we anticipate bringing these aircraft back into service as spares to supplement our operation as needed during the summer. As we have discussed on past earnings calls, we have several initiatives to improve our operating reliability. The initiatives we are undertaking are making sure that our aircraft are ready to start the day, depart on time and then turn throughout the day on schedule.","We also continue to evaluate and refine our planning processes to ensure that we are ready to deliver better service during our peak travel periods throughout the year. But we still have a lot of work to do, I am pleased to report that despite the challenges we have had with our fleet, we've improved our competitive position for reliability.","Our relative on time performance, completion factor both improved. We've seen particularly strong performance from our Northeast hubs and Philadelphia, DCA, LaGuardia and JFK.","And our regional operations have been outstanding, delivering the expected results from our continued investment in the regional fleet, the simplification of our Eagle partner portfolio and performance initiatives to ensure consistency across the regional business.","We've made steady improvements in our international wide body performance as well, delivering the best quarter of on time performance in our history and we're setting new reliability records for our cargo customers as well.","On the product side, we have continued to take big steps forward in creating a world class customer experience. During the first quarter, we opened newly renovated Admirals Clubs in Boston and Charlotte, nearly doubling the seating capacity and our renovation project in Pittsburgh just finished up last week. We will also be growing our network of flagship first dining and flagship lounges with DFW opening later in the second quarter.","During the first quarter, we announced new innovative and exclusive partnerships that further differentiate American from competition with a private suite at Los Angeles International Airport and with Blade, a helicopter transfer service at both LAX and JFK.","These new partnerships further enhance American's already well-known five star service offerings for premium customers. In addition, we announced an enhanced partnership with Hyatt Hotels. Elite members in both the advantage and world of Hyatt loyalty programs will be rewarded with more ways to earn points, miles and status on qualifying American flights and Hyatt hotel stays.","On the digital front, in-flight Wi-Fi has long been a frustration for our airline customers, as slow speeds and frequent outages had made for a difficult experience. This is no longer the case with American. We have now have \u2013 we now have the bandwidth to meet their needs, our customer's needs, as our installations of high speed Wi-Fi throughout our domestic - our domestic fleet are nearly complete.","We've also activated free live TV on nearly all of our mainline aircraft and we continue to be the only U.S. carrier to offer live television on international flights. In addition, we launched the new exclusive partnership with Apple, giving our customers access to Apple Music to stream more than 50 songs, playlist and music videos on any domestic flight equipped via Satellite Wi-Fi. These are just a few of the examples of the investments that we have made in our product that further differentiate American from the competition.","As we look to our network, we are leveraging our strengths with high margin growth planned at our DIA Dallas\/Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs. The first stage of that growth commences in May where we'll begin using our 15 new gates at DFW, which will add approximately 100 departures per day.","We've already begun selling tickets to 23 new routes and additional frequencies in over 70 markets. And the early results are encouraging, as both bookings and yields are coming in at rates higher than the system average.","This marks the first opportunity for significant growth at one of our most profitable hubs. We are excited about adding this capacity particularly into the diverse and robust North Texas economy, which is one of the fastest growing regions in the U.S.","We remain on track with our growth plans in Charlotte for 2020 and at our hub in Washington DCA in 2021. Our local sales and distribution team produced strong results last quarter, as corporate revenue growth outpaced system revenue growth on a healthy corporate demand and improved corporate fair environment.","The team continues to execute on making American Airlines the easiest airline to do business with, including recent corporate recognition enhancements. Corporate customers now receive complimentary priority access, which includes a priority check in, priority security and group for boarding and during irregular operations, corporate customers now receive a higher prioritization for re-accommodation.","Working with our Corporate Customer Advisory Board, we received guidance and feedback on this and other strategic initiatives, solidifying American Airlines as the preferred airline for business travellers.","The first quarter was also another record breaking quarter for new corporate account acquisitions, ensuring a strong and healthy pipeline for future corporate growth. Based on our recent corporate customer survey 90% of respondents said that they plan to increase or maintain their spend in 2019, as compared to last year. So we feel confident about corporate demand for the remainder of the year.","In loyalty, we continue to see strong growth in advantage fliers, along with more customers qualifying for elite status with year over year yield improvements exceeding system increases.","We are also seeing strong growth in redemption bookings. We set first quarter records for acquisitions and spend on our advantage credit cards. And we expect that to carry forward for the full year.","As we've previously mentioned, the enhancements to our city advantage platinum card and the introduction of the no fee mile up card last year have increased customer engagement in both acquisitions and retention. This quarter we're excited to announce new benefits for our Barclays Red and Silver Aviator Cards, beginning on May 1st.","New card features include an annual companion certificate and enhancements to the travel experience with credits for onboard Wi-Fi and food and beverages. With these changes, we believe we offer an unrivaled portfolio of cards to engage a broad range of customers.","Our product segmentation strategy continues to provide choice for our customers and drive incremental revenue for the company. With our premium economy retrofit program now complete American has more aircraft with this differentiated product than any other U.S. airline.","The average fare for premium economy continues to be twice the coach fare making it the most profitable use of square footage on our wide body aircraft. We are an industry leader in this category and our customers are noticing as we were recently recognized by TripAdvisor for having the best premium economy product for the more \u2013 for North American carriers and their Travelers Choice Awards.","All of this resulted in record first quarter revenue of $10.6 billion, up approximately 2% year over year. On a unit revenue basis, total revenue per available seat mile improved 0.5% percent year over year. This marks the tenth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for American.","We are pleased with our revenue performance, although we were slightly below guidance, we were on track until the middle until the middle of March and the grounding of MAX after which we saw close in softness to the balance of March due to schedule uncertainty resulting from the MAX related cancellations.","Also as a reminder in 2018 we made a big investment on our advantage program, making it more valuable to customers. We significantly increased the inventory available for redemptions in 2018, increasing the value of the mile to our customers, while also giving our customers more flexibility to use their miles.","For the quarter these changes had a negative impact of 0.9 points to unit revenue. We anticipate a similar impact for the remainder of the year. Normalizing for this, our passenger unit revenue would have increased 1.5% in the quarter, a solid result considering the impact of the MAX grounding and our exposure to weak long haul Latin markets.","We led the industry in year over year performance in both the Atlantic and Pacific entities, as we were able to grow load factor in a weak pricing environment. The Pacific also benefited from our network restructuring to China and our partnership with Japan Airlines. Japan unit revenue grew by double-digits.","Our normalizing unit revenue for the domestic business grew by 1.2% in spite of the MAX routing. Latin performance was weak for American in the first quarter due to Argentina and Venezuela unit revenues which were down by over 20% and also difficult year over year comps. We expect the Latin entity to move to positive territory in the second quarter.","Looking forward, we expect our second quarter year over year TRASM to be up 1% to 3%, a 1.5 point sequential improvement from the first quarter. This incorporates a negative 0.5% impact due to the MAX grounding and a negative to unit revenue because the MAX cancellations are higher yielding, lower stage likes flights from an overall system perspective and we are re-accommodating passengers into seats that would have otherwise sold at higher fare levels.","So as we prepare for the busy summer season, we are all excited about what the future holds for American Airlines. We are intensely focused on creating value for our shareholders by running a great operation and continuing to improve our product and taking advantage of the opportunities to strengthen our network.","With that, we'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","David Vernon","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the guide down on fuel and how you're thinking about the revenue environment as we get through the year. Obviously you can't give us guidance on what TRASM should be doing, but I wanted to make sure there isn't something that's following on from the disruptions caused by MAX that might make it harder for you to go ahead and exercise a little bit more pricing in a market where there's less capacity and higher fuel cost?","Doug Parker","Okay, sure, David. This is Doug and let me first take the guidance point and then Don can talk more about the environment. So anway, the guidance change was simply again you know, oil prices are - just the change in oil prices versus three months ago $650 million [indiscernible] We didn't build into our guidance some hope that because oil prices are higher than they were three months ago that fares in the future are going to be higher than they are today.","That may be the case we shall see, but we didn't do that. In this case the other three months higher \u2013 the $650 million are higher they were three months ago, but they're not much higher or much different than they were a year ago or certainly you know throughout the 2013.","So they went down for a period of time. At the time we gave our last guidance, they've recovered. That doesn't \u2013 while we'll do everything we can of course to make sure we're pricing to cover our cost and increase cost as to the guidance itself largely just as the fuel price being adjusted back to current levels where they were three months ago. Don, do you want to talk about the environment.","Don Casey","Sure. So just you know, we did see during the first quarter you know a bit of weakness in leisure yields. This was driven primarily by price reductions and flow and connecting markets in the domestic business, plus some sporadic aggressive pricing in trans cut [ph] markets.","The biggest impact however was just the grounding of the MAX through the end of March and through April. As we look forward from where we\u2019re right now load factors are up in future months and the yield environment has stabilized and we're seeing growth every week and the yields are pretty happy with what the outlook looks like, which is one of the reasons why we've guided up about 0.5 in the first quarter.","David Vernon","Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow up to that, I think you know some of the other \u2013 the airlines that have reported have said, had actually called out a little bit more sequential improvement in things like corporate bookings. Can you comment a little bit on how the closing bookings look current for America?","Don Casey","Sure. So again as we went through the quarter, we actually stress through January and February, a very, very strong closing yields for bookings within 13 days of departure, with the MAX cancellations we did see some share shift. This was caused by the fact that we re-accommodated customers on two flights and just less seats out in the market to go sell. That is an impact to the end of March and really through April as well.","And we saw just because of schedule uncertainty as we canceled the schedule in three tranches some customers moving away just due to schedule uncertainty, that is now kind of come back and we're seeing the same kind of kind of close in yield improvements that we saw in January and February.","David Vernon","Great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jamie Baker","Hey. Good morning, everybody. The August 19th MAX date would seem to imply that recertification would need to occur sometime in July. I mean, I suppose you can operate the aircraft as spares once you have the green light, but obviously you need several weeks to sell the inventory.","So you know that that July timing seems to be at odds with a growing consensus that a global regulatory consensus may be needed. And of course, rolling cancellations such as this diminish shield production. So why wouldn't the better, more profitable strategy be removing the MAXs until the holidays, adjusting labor lines accordingly and reaping the RASM benefits associated with that reduced capacity?","Don Casey","Okay, Jamie. Let me try first the premise. And then if you'd like to explain why- if we did what you're suggesting, I think that would not be - that that would actually hurt earnings not help them.","Jamie Baker","By all means?","Don Casey","Yes. So on the premise itself that you know, when these aircraft come back into service. You know, as Robert said, we - after you know getting every piece of information we can from the FAA and Boeing who have been working closely with us of course, you know we came to the conclusion that we needed to - we needed for our customers certainty in booking and for our team members to put the start up date as far out in the future as we thought - as we as we said to FAA and Boeing that we need like 95% certainty, that the aircraft \u2013 that what we're \u2013 that what we're going to be - what we're going to be selling will actually be flown. That's what we think about August 19th.","There are all sorts of different suggestions as to what is required to do this. But the reality is the FAA and the DOT regulate the US carriers. They are working closely with Boeing. Everything we see at this point is there - is a fix that makes the aircraft airworthy for any airline.","And when that - when they make that determination we expect with the aircraft will be recertified. And again, we believe August 19th is a date that gives us a lot of certainty, it gives our customer certainty and expect actually that it'll be certified well before that date. So that's why we said it there because we think it's well outside the day.","So anyway, actually that's where we are\u2026","Jamie Baker","Okay\u2026","Don Casey","You know, doing something different and that is why we did it, that's because we believe that the aircraft will be certified before that. And I certainly hope that's the case.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Second, and this may be a little bit tougher. Can you give us a feel for how many new hires you've made in pricing and revenue management over the past 970 days, not entry level, but any mid to high level type hiring\u2019s?","Don Casey","Well, maybe you can tell us why you'd like to know that. I'm just confused what you're trying to get at Jamie.","Jamie Baker","I believe that your marketing department received a blow roughly 970 days ago with Scott's departure.","Don Casey","Okay, thanks. Doug?","Doug Parker","There really hasn't been anybody and so mid market and mid-level and up in the organization is are all people that we\u2019re here when Scott was here.","Don Casey","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hey Derek, can you just help provide some sensitivity around, some earnings sensitivity around potentially longer 737 MAX drowning. I mean, I guess I'm looking for something like you know if we lose it for an extra month then the EPS it is x? Can you - are you able to do that?","Derek Kerr","It'll be harder to do. But I mean, I can give you what the EPS impact. I mean, we said it's $0.60 for where we're at. By month or by quarter, right now in the second quarter we said over $350 million dollar impact. We have 50 in the first quarter approximately 185 in the second quarter and approximately 115 in the third quarter. So I would say you know 185 in the second quarter is a full quarter. So that's a number that's there the whole time. But that is the summer and that's the peak. So it might be a little bit higher than if it continued into August, September, October it might have a little bit less effect where we probably have a little bit more room.","I mean, the reason we took it down to August 19th is that's when the end of the summer is and when the peak is. So we may have a little bit more room in August and September you know. to o cover some of the flying.","So I think that that's the best we can do right now from that effect. But you got $0.60 a share and then the impact about 180 and a full quarter.","Darryl Genovesi","Well, that's good. That's helpful. Thank you. And then and then Robert or Don, just looking at booking trends that you've seen since the MAX - since the MAX was initially or maybe even going back to before the MAXs was grounded, but when some of these headlines started coming up, have you seen anything in booking trends that would suggest a reluctance on the part of your customer base to take 737 NG flights. I mean I guess I'm just thinking that to the infrequent traveller, a 737- 800 and a 737-8, sound like more or less exactly the same thing. So just wondering if you've seen anything like that yet and if that's something that we shouldn't worry about you know, even post the return to service by the MAX>","Robert Isom","The answer is no, there's not a significant change in load factors you know from what we can see. I think the bigger issue has been schedule uncertainty. You know, don't forget that to get to where we are now we had to go through a series of tranches of cancellations that were all close in. And as Don mentioned earlier you know, we had - in for closing bookings you know, we saw share shift that definitely benefited some of our competition.","You know, the good news is, is that now we've canceled you know further out that that certainty is back and it really gives us something that we can go out with, our sales and distribution teams to give confidence that that schedule is certain. But in regard to questions about a preference for aircraft types, we don't - we haven't seen anything like that.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thanks for the update, appreciate it.","Robert Isom","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter Keay","Hey. Morning, Doug. Thank you everybody. Hey you guys have talked about over actually your over $3 billion in merger related costs being pulled out of CASM now five years after the merger. You're not the only airline to do that and so sorry to isolate you here. But I'm curious to know when these are going to stop and how much of the special items, you know, this quarter and that $3 billion have been cash? Thanks.","Doug Parker","Thanks I'll try and give you details. Look, really good question one that we ask ourselves all the time and our auditors ask us. But the reality is what we \u2013 we\u2019re very careful about what we include in special items, they are meant to be items that are non-recurring items. Therefore to give all of us and our investors in particular an idea of what the ongoing financial performance of the company is.","So and the fact of the matter is in an airline merger related activities still go on four and five years later and they still are. So we work through with our auditors to figure out what exactly things that are that are going on that are related to the merger. We still have issues related to mergers its something we \u2013 just this quarter. We got our flight attendants onto one scheduling system, so that they can - so they can work together, there is a lot more to do in maintenance and other items. So they are items that we wouldn't do if it weren't for the merger that wouldn't have been in either companies, you know if they were separate, they're there because we merged two airlines and have to incur expenses as a result of the merger. But Derek, any one detail\u2026","Derek Kerr","Well, I would say its exactly right. I think from a cash standpoint the merger and integration items are okay. Items that come out of cash, whereas I think the fleet restructuring is non-cash and it's just bringing falling forward, catch up depreciation and accelerated depreciation. Example is you know, the aircraft that you know as part of the merger we're doing are - we call it the Oasis project or the project to conform the aircraft and make sure that they're all the seats are the same on both A321s and 73s that makes us go on the newer 737 aircraft and retire like the seats in the videos on the back five years earlier and that's catch up depreciation that you put in there. So that's non-cash, merger and integration is almost all cash. As you break out the two numbers.","Hunter Keay","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then you know, Robert or whoever maybe, you talked about Dallas growth and obviously reference to the economic strength in the region, but capacity in the DFW area is going to be about 50% higher this summer than it was in 2010.","How are you thinking about that in terms of maybe you know, over saturating the market, competing against yourself either of your local or connecting basis and just managing the risk around some of this growth? Thanks.","Don Casey","Anyway, I don't think we're actually up 50%, I am not sure.","Hunter Keay","Not you. No, no, Don, not you. It\u2019s the DFW area between you and Love Field, to be clear. Sorry.","Don Casey","Yeah, even looking at us on Love Field, I'm not sure how you get to 50%, you know, number. I mean the big part of the growth and Love Field is capped, right. So there's really no departure growth happening at Love Field right now. We're growing about 100 departures right at DFW from 800 to 900. But anyway\u2026","Hunter Keay","Don, I'm sorry. I was talking about - just to be clear, from 2010 it's a long time ago, not year on year.","Don Casey","It's arguably a cherry picked trough, but the point there is lot more capacity on it was 10 years ago and I'm just trying to make sure you know, how you guys are thinking about the competitive impact, either from yourselves or others? That\u2019s what I'm getting at? Thanks.","Hunter Keay","Sure. Well, as we get from 2010 to 2018 right which was up until last year, it's been one of our best performing hubs during that entire time period, right. We're growing at this year a big percentage of the customers we're going to grow we're going to be connecting customers, right, so not really reliant, just on the DFW market. And again when we look at the early results in terms of the how the new markets are booking up, their booking at or above the system average, so I think we're pretty encouraged.","Derek Kerr","Yeah. And we\u2019re looking at all Jim is \u2013 I am sorry, I do it every time. And it's not intentional, I promised.","Doug Parker","Jamie and I were just discussing that earlier this morning ironically, but you continue.","Derek Kerr","I know, sincere apologies to you both. So look, again I mean, this is one of these once in a lifetime opportunities that are good for the airline in everyway, it is you know, our largest of the chance to expand it by 100 departures, it doesn't come along very often.","Frankly it's not so much about Dallas, as it is about the United States because we connect \u2013 we will be connecting most of those people over Dallas much more to markets that we weren't able to sell before. In some cases that our competitors are able so in other cases that we just sold you know not very efficiently.","So it's you know, these things as Robert noted we add these flights, they come in at system average, they don't need to build up their markets that - there's demand for the travel and you fly an airplane into Dallas, Fort Worth and it connects people to hundreds of markets. They didn't have opportunities to fly to before. It's built not the hub getting it even to be even more powerful than it is today. And it's really, it's very nice growth.","Doug Parker","I\u2019ll just add that you know these 15 Gates in this satellite-e, that's a fantastic opportunity. So you know versus you know going out and spending tens of millions dollars you know for Gate you know anywhere else you know for growth. These are these are a fraction of a fraction of that kind of cost and we're ready to go. So excited.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you very much.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Jose Caiado of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jose Caiado","Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the time. I was hoping we could start just with the cost of the MAX grounding, which you quantified at $350 million for the year. I guess, I'm struggling to reconcile that with what we heard yesterday from your crosstown competitor which has larger fleet exposure than you do, but appears to be guiding to a lesser MAX impact for the full year. Could you maybe walk us through why that might be and the moving pieces there, is that maybe a function of where you concentrated at your MAX fleet just any help there?","Doug Parker","Okay. First, anyway. I look at that number, their absolute numbers that they gave one, and if they did it's dramatically different.","Don Casey","I mean, the only thing we could figure out from their guidance was they went \u2013 CASM was worst by 4% and RASM went up by 1%. So a four point basis point reduction in earnings which would be over on their margin would be over $250 million dollars in the second quarter. So\u2026","Doug Parker","But we shouldn't speak for that But our analysis at least on what they said looked consistent with ours is what we should say, we may be missing that, but what we just looked at what they said came in those numbers as Derek said that way. So it seem totally consistent.","In terms of the absolute number, the inconsistency versus ours is a little bit as Robert suggested that our RASM in the second quarter would be lower than it would've been otherwise, this suggest to be would be higher, and they have higher CASM and we didn't have until we got that much.","You know, again this is not speaking for them only for us, but trying ourselves to understand why that may be, that is that we see more of a revenue per ASM change and \u2013 we see revenue per ASM falling actually, they see it going up a little bit.","And in the second quarter a few points to make, one in this December MAX of course is an entirely domestic airplane. So on the American Airlines system, well the domestic revenue per ASM is a higher number than revenue per ASM internationally because of stage link.","So Southwest probably doesn\u2019t have the issue. They don't - they're not taking out their highest revenue per ASM flying, in this case we are just a math issue basically. But that would have an impact.","The other point you know that I that I imagine is the case. Robert talked about how painful this is to us. At American in the near term when we have people who have bought travel in advance, so you know in our pricing model, Some leisure travelers with advanced purchases who have bought lower priced tickets. And then we cancel them in a relatively near term. In a peak, we need to provide them seats that we were holding back for higher price customers, for higher yielding customers.","So that has a real impact on revenue per ASM. And again, Southwest pricing model has less of that than ours. So those again is our best guess as to why they may be seeing a different thing on revenue per ASM than we are.","But the total - the total profitability impact to us look right in line with where we are, but if we're wrong on that, let us not\u2026","Jose Caiado","Yeah, I know that\u2019s\u2026","Doug Parker","What are you talking for certain is we feel really confident in our number, we spent a lot of time on it and we feel really good about our estimate.","Yeah, that's totally fair. Thank you for that Doug. I know it's not clean math, but that's helpful. Just switching gears, Robert or Don maybe, I was hoping you could give us an update on where you are with those IT initiatives or that that infrastructure work that you were doing that was going to enhance your ability to kind of push out more offers and drive more ancillary conversions. Is that project completed and contributing already?","Robert Isom","No, Don, you can \u2013 and Mike can add in here to, we're on track to be able to really put some nice offers out that to customers that you know post purchase but pre-flight at the end of this month.","Doug Parker","That's right our first product its an upscale subsidiary push offers at upselling a premium cabin and we're going to be in market with our initial product by the end of May.","Jose Caiado","That's great. Thanks for the time everyone.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Mckenzie of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Dan Mckenzie","Hey good morning. Thanks, guys. First question is really just sort of a clarifying question regarding the full year guide you know the narrative in the first quarter was off peak pricing weakness because there's too much capacity and as I just kind of look at the growth that you guys are laying out for the fourth quarter it's up 6% and you know not asking you guys to give a revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, but just hoping you can clarify whether the kind of revised guide does factor in some off peak pricing weakness that you know it's probably likely to manifest in the fourth quarter or are what gives you comfort that the fourth quarter won't be a repeat of the first quarter?","Doug Parker","Its Doug. When we talk about growth for this year it is DFW and then the start of Charlotte. So you know again as we take a look at you know any of the growth that is done it mentioned earlier any growth we have planned for the summer as we extend out into that schedule for DFW and Charlotte. You know we think that that is a smart growth and it's growth that is going to maintain performance for us we take a look out through the end of the year.","Dan Mckenzie","Okay. I just try to clear this, the fourth quarter factor in potentially some pricing weakness or you know there's a fact I mean maybe you can just help because that Hunter's question, actually was my question as well, maybe you can just help us understand the nature of the growth you know what percent of the growth is smaller high yielding markets, you know what percent is kind of a larger competitive markets that may be lost on folks, just as we kind of think about the revenue trajectory through the end of the year?","Doug Parker","Again the bulk of the growth is going to be focused on Dallas right, skewed to overall domestic growth. Domestic has again higher nominal, right. So the entity mix as we head into the fourth quarter is going to be favorable for us.","Dan Mckenzie","Smaller markets though I mean like 50% of the growth out of Dallas is to smaller higher yielding markets. So can you just help give us a little bit more clarity there?","Doug Parker","50% regional. So that that would be the case.","Dan Mckenzie","Understood. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Susan Donofrio of Macquarie Capital. Your line is now up.","Susan Donofrio","Yes, good morning. I just wanted to get some more color on your international markets in terms of the trends you're seeing. If you could also just provide a little more color on competition in those markets?","Don Casey","Okay, sure. This is Don. I mean, if you go to look at the first quarter you know Latin was our most challenged entity for the quarter. You know particular for Argentina and Venezuela where we saw you know revenue declines as you know more than 20%. Just as a reminder we did end up suspending operations to Venezuela on March 28. So that won't have an impact as we look forward.","We also in the first quarter - particularly difficult comps in Latin America in our unit revenue growth in the first quarter last year is up 12%, while the rest of the industry grew in the 5% range.","We also face some currency headwinds in the first quarter. Latin America by about 1.7 points. But as we look forward into the second quarter in Latin America we expect Latin America actually positive in the second quarter and we expect Brazil to have positive revenue in the second quarter as well.","In Atlantic, we did see softer pricing in the economy cabin during the first quarter which we're able to offset with higher load factors. Premium demand did hold up and we were able to improve our yields in the premium cabins.","UK was our top performing market in the first quarter and we have not really seen any impact at this point related to Brexit. And we expect similar to potentially slightly better performance in Atlantic as we look into the second quarter.","Pacific was our best performing entity for the quarter with unit revenue growth about 9%. Gains were really in both yield and load factor across the both economy and business gap. And so it is really broad strength in the Pacific.","I mean every entity in the Pacific I posit you know revenue growth led by Hong Kong, Japan. We benefited from our restructuring of our operations to China and our partnership with China Southern.","So we added five additional Kocher cities to Beijing, and now to Shanghai we now cover either through our own metal or through our coach. With China Southern 86% of demand. So we expect that Pacific looking forward to be solidly profitable in the second quarter - solidly positive in the second quarter as well.","Susan Donofrio","Great. And then just as a follow up on, is there anything you're doing in terms of further integration of your alliance partners?","Don Casey","I guess, that's just an ongoing process right. So with all of our joint businesses you know, we have a roadmap of initiatives on how we're going to better integrate our services because that's really the key is creating more seamless experience for customers across the combined networks.","Doug Parker","And there's good news on the horizon, that we're very confident that our Qantas JV. will be approved to go forward sometime soon and that's beneficial. And we're constantly at work with IAG, especially B.A. and making sure that you know every thing that we do is making our product more consistent and easier to use for our customers.","Susan Donofrio","Great. Thank you.","Doug Parker","Thanks, Susan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just one question Doug, as you outlined in your release free cash flow should increase significantly heading into 2020 and really kind of be a first year of true free cash flow generation since the merger.","I know this has been the story given your CapEx program and other cash hasn't come in the door for a bit, but can you maybe just give us a sense of what your priorities are going be for that free cash flow as you stand right now? Thanks.","Doug Parker","Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. They'll be consistent, what you've seen from us to date and then looking at - and our view on capital allocation goes like this, as we generate cash we use it first, again having generating cash having - having invested in the operation, but having produced revenues in excess of what we've spent in the operation.","We then look to invest in the business in any manner that can get returns for our investors, that meet our thresholds. Those obviously as we as we get through all of this both merger - capital expense and fleet monetization expense fall off. So we'll have - we have less need for CapEx is what we're saying.","We then look to with the cash flow then it still exists. Free cash flow that comes we look to make sure that all of our debt is efficient and not at the level that is remotely concerning. So there's any debt that can be - it is that high levels can be preplanning debt that's coming due that is amortizing we pay off and may or may not decide to refinance issue, refinance based upon where we're at the time.","Having done all that what we want to be certain is at least in today's environment that we have at least $7 billion of liquidity at any time, that's an enormous amount of cash for a company our size. But that is the cost to our shareholders and it being more levered.","What we know is as confident we are in the future we need to be prepared for any short of any sort of black swan type event that could require us to need additional capital, so we hold a lot of cash with a view that's more important in those times than having unencumbered airplanes which are hard to finance in those times.","So having done all that to the extent there's a free cash flow that goes for our shareholders because we've determined that there's - we've used what we've generate to as best - as best we can. And having no other alternatives we look to give it back to our shareholders. If we believe the stock is undervalued, the best way to do that is buyback our shares. If we happen to believe the stock is fairly valued, we would look to do things like dividends. o that's what you should expect.","Andrew Didora","Great. Thank you for that.\\","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Joseph DeNardi","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Doug, kind of along those lines, you've got the free cash flow outlook over the next few years, you know what your stock is trading at now. Is there any thought to kind of pulling some of that forward. You've talked about eventually lowering the $7 billion to something like 5. What are your thoughts there at this point? Thanks.","Doug Parker","Yeah, look I don't believe either 77, do we're going to lower in 75. So I want to correct that. What I have said I think is $7 billion is a really high number for a company our size. I'm always careful to note that because some people started talking about that as some sort of a minimum cash is not even closer to a maximum cash. Basically you could run this airline up to probably $2 billion of cash before you started being \u2013 before you started having sort of issues about the future.","But - so we hold basically a $5 billion cushion, I think I said, and maybe that at some point I think it'll be - it'll make sense to relook that number. But you know., where we today we still believe that's the right number we still do have, we still are working through merger, we still do have some large CapEx expenditures in this year and we still and frankly we still and we - this earnings level that we're projecting isn\u2019t what we believe is an earnings level that gets us excited about reducing that number either.","So for all those reasons we think $7 billion is the right number at this point in time. And as aggressive as we are in terms of wanting to return capital to shareholders certainly and aggressive at these valuations and wanting to repurchase shares. We are equally if not where we are more aggressive in our view that we're not going to - we're not going to violate the $7 billion cash number. As we move forward, we think that's important that we keep in place that - as we sit here today.","As we move forward, I suspect we'll come to the conclusion that we don't need to have that large of a number. But we're still working through all the issues I said and as we do so that feel like the right number now.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then just on the 357, I mean, I know the proxy will come out shortly. Can you talk about whether the bonus pool got funded in 2018 that you fell short on a pre-tax income basis of the three? And then how you're thinking about that going forward and any changes you're thinking about on the 357? Thank you.","Doug Parker","Yeah. Happy to. I think in the 357 everyone else doesn't know we're talking about \u2013 we have and have had for a while our incentive - our short term incentive plan tied to pre-tax profits with a threshold $3 billion, target of $5 billion maximum of $7 billion which is which as we've stated is our long term view about the profitability generating potential of this company.","In 2018, you're right on a reported basis we were slightly below %3 billion on a pre-tax level but this calculation is made prior to the payments themselves of course and prior to profit sharing. So what you'll see in the proxy is that while it was reported number below $3 billion in terms of the plan calculation it was slightly above $3 billion. So the team got a 51% of their target bonus in 2018.","As we move to 2019 and setting the plan you know, we - as to the named executive officers me and my director reports are still are still on in 2018 the 357 plan. But look we got to be careful about making sure that while we may believe that's the long term future, we're going to make certain that we have incentive plans that allow our team to believe they have a reasonable chance at getting their bonuses in any given year.","So we did amend the plan for everyone below the any of us to \u2013 for ought to be split into two components now of financial - financial plan and the operational plan 50\/50 of each and the financial piece we tied for 2018, for 2019 I am sorry, to $4 billion of pre-tax earnings and starting at zero, much like the profit sharing does. So that - that's where we set it going forward.","Long way we say, which I think you really care about more is what is our view about 357 over the long term, its still - again we said there, I still believe this company has potential. I will tell you as we sit here today you know, given where we were for the past couple of years, as you think about explaining to people where you think you are. I would say certainly as you go into 2019 that it feels a lot more like 3, 4, 5, 4 is a good year, 5 would be a great year, 3 is not a very good year.","That's - and I am not trying to make any big statement there about our long term view of the company, but just rather let you know what it feels like today and really what I'm saying it's tightened somewhat in that range.","And you know, and we'll see where it goes going forward. But you know, what I would also point out is if you want to go build the numbers like that in the models into the future you're going to find I believe you will find that our stock is well undervalued because it's not trading like - it's certainly not trading at 3, 5, 7, it is not trading like 3, 4,5. And that's where we believe we are today.","Joseph DeNardi","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Parker","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Savi Syth","Hey, good morning. I just had two quick follow up question, just on the summer operations in Dallas, I recognize that you're getting additional gate, so it's not like you're working more gates. But just given the extra flying are you comfortable with the kind of the air side capacity and you know - that we're not going to see something like we saw in LAX a couple of years ago?","Doug Parker","Yeah, great news on that, as we've had teams that hard at work for you know literally you know over a year to make sure not only the facility is ready to go, but surface management at the airport and then also you know ATC is ready to go. And so when we take a look at from a regional perspective or from a mainline perspective and whether you're talking about you know Gates or equipment or personnel, we've already ramped up to a considerable level, we're not quite at the 900 level yet, but we will be at the end of this month and really confident about where we go - where we are going forward.","Savi Syth","Helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow up on the capacity, you mentioned that you'll take a look at forward capacity, it's going to fuel states higher as you get into the shoulder periods again. Is there is that more of the kind of domestic perspective or should we think international and domestic or how should we think about kind of - where the potential cuts could come?","Doug Parker","Well, we haven't thinking about cuts, what I would say is that we're all - we're always on the lookout to make sure that we're optimizing profitability for the network as a whole. And so you know both you know international, domestic are interrelated and you know it's a network business. So as we take a look we will evaluate, you know our hubs, we\u2019ll evaluate our fleet and certainly you know, all the cities that we fly.","But as you know - I'll underscore again you know when we talk about the DFW flying for the remainder of the year and the growth that we have planned for the year it's largely DFW related and the kind of things that we're doing, is we're adding some new markets, some new spokes to DFW places like Cheyenne, and Del Rio and Harlingen you know, places that we haven\u2019t served and then you know increasing capacity from a perspective of frequency out of DFW just some markets both you know, the smaller and midsized that we think that's going to make DFW stronger overall for the long run.","Doug Parker","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now be taking questions from members of the media. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tracy Rucinski of Reuters. Your line is now open.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi. Good morning Doug, you seem very confident about the MAX being ungrounded by August 19th. But there is still some uncertainty from global regulators. So my question is, if the FAA a recertifies the MAX, that other regions or countries like Europe or Canada have issue will you still fly it?","Doug Parker","If the FAA recertifies the MAX, we absolutely will fly the airplane. That's our regulator. And if the FAA determines that it's airworthy, it is absolutely airworthy and anyone that\u2019s flying on an aircraft will know that for certain. Look, but, this is part of the issue that you know FAA and DOT need to work through, the administration needs to work through. And I don't know that that's a scenario that will develop or not.","But to be clear, we're regulated by the FAA. We know that that aircraft with our pilots with our training systems, with our aircraft is airworthy, will be certainly will be airworthy if the FAA recertifies it and we will \u2013 so yes.","Tracy Rucinski","Okay. And if pilots ask for added level of simulator training on checklists related to MCAS failures, like runway stabilizer, will you provide it? And is there any possibility that additional training demands either from pilot unions or global regulator could delay the return to service of the aircraft?","Doug Parker","Well, look again, our pilots were critical of this, we've been working. Our pilots have been heavily involved in all this work. We -that's what gives us - what will give us confidence and what will give the flying public confidence that the aircraft is safe to fly will be when American Airlines pilots say that it's safe to fly because I can tell you for certain is that if an American owned pilot decides that their plane is safe to fly you can be a hundred percent certain of that and not because - not out of bravado, out of analysis, out of understanding the aircraft, out of training, out of knowing, they have been their co-pilot has been trained accordingly.","So absolutely our pilots will be not just involved and critical to this process will make sure whatever time the aircraft is deemed airworthy that our pilots will - that will have a leadership role in ensuring that they are comfortable with that.","So that's given and we'll make sure that will be done. But again we believe based on what we know now that that was by August 19th, we will pass those thresholds.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.","Alison Sider","Hi. Thanks so much. Good morning. You know, since the two crashes there's just been a lot of discussion about pilot training, standards around the world. Just wondering if you have looked at some of your partner airlines if you're having any concerns or questions about training at partners and if that's something you have conversations with them about?","Doug Parker","So that the good news is that you know we work very closely with all of our partner carriers and it is a process when we establish relationships, you know we do extensive reviews of their operations as well. And so you know from our perspective you know we feel very comfortable with the one more carriers that we deal with and as well with you know our joint business partners and we'll continue to make sure that you know customers flying an American Airlines whether on American Airlines or with any of our partners that they're getting the best service and the most safe and reliable service that you can get.","Alison Sider","And are those things - are those ongoing conversations you know, have there been any sort of like renewed looks at that standards or procedures that other airlines or is that something that sort of happened you know at the outset on a partnership...","Doug Parker","It's a constant process.","Alison Sider","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Patti Waldmeir of Financial Times. Your line is now open.","Patti Waldmeir","Thanks so much. Can you say anything about what compensation you may be seeking from Boeing for the costs that you've referred to on this call, the cost of the grounding and you know even things like you know staff working overtime to rebook passengers things like that?","Doug Parker","Yeah, all of our efforts at this point are working to make sure you get the airplane recertified and flying again for our customers and our team members were working closely with Boeing, at the appropriate time we'll talk about what this is done to American.","And Boeing's is a very good and long time partner and we'll work through that privately, but nothing that we \u2013 we had any conversations at that point yet. And at some point perhaps we will, but right now we're focused on working together to get the airplane back andrecertify.","Patti Waldmeir","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Biers of AFP. Your line is now open.","John Biers","Thank you. Just most of my questions have been answered already, but I wondered are you - how does this whole situation with the 737 MAX affect the way you think about Boeing versus Airbus going forward?","Doug Parker","Boeing, is a phenomenal company that builds great airplanes as is Airbus. Obviously we're not happy about this issue but no one is. Tragic events and what we care about is safety and we will work together as this industry always does to ensure that safety is the number one focus. And we don't compete on safety nor do aircraft manufacturers.","So we will as an industry make certain that that this is addressed in a way that ensures that all aircraft are 100% safe and as that happens we're certain that both manufacturers are committed to that as we are.","John Biers","Did you feel like you have a clear understanding of what went wrong with the aircraft, in the crashes at this point?","Doug Parker","I'll just I'll just chime in here. Look we have to - first off you know we operated the 737 MAX you know very successfully for a number of months and really hadn't had to deal with any anomalies. So what we're doing is working with the FAA and with Boeing on what's been reported you know from the incidents to make the aircraft better and correct any deficiencies. And I know that when we get through with addressing the issues related to MKS software that it's going to be an even better plane.","And so, again from our perspective we have what you know about you know issues related to the aircraft. We certainly have our own experience with it and we're constantly working to make sure that we make the aircraft better and you know we look forward to recertification.","John Biers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Ted Reed of Forbes. Your line is now open.","Ted Reed","Thank you. I have two questions. First, I'd like to know about Munich. I don't understand the reasoning behind canceling Philadelphia and then starting Munich, Charlotte and Munich Dallas?","Doug Parker","Hey, Ted. We're constantly taking a look at how the marketplace works and for us it's just better connecting opportunities. And so we think that it's going to be a great fight and hopefully it'll lead to better things in the future.","Ted Reed","Looking strong from the two new destiny from the two new hub, from these two hubs?","Doug Parker","Yes it is. And you know for smaller markets you just need a lot more connecting traffic to make, in survey\u2026","Ted Reed","Secondly, I thought the pilot talks were going to go rapidly but now it seems that they're going slowly and that there might not be any kind of deal till next year? Is that the case.","Doug Parker","We've just begun negotiation with our pilots. The talks are happening well in advance of the amendable date which is January of 2020. So we're happy to be talking well in advance of that. And we would be - it would be nice to get something done before the amenable date. I think both parties goals and we'll keep working toward that, nothing new to report.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you, Doug.","Doug Parker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Doug Parker for closing remarks.","Doug Parker","My closing remarks is thank you. Thank you for your interest. If you have any questions give Dan or corporate communications a call. Thanks, again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"1455":["American Airlines Group, Inc.

Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. You may begin.","Dan Cravens","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our Q&A session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs, and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. In addition, we have Devon May, our Senior VP of Networks Strategy; and Kenji Hashimoto, our Senior VP of Finance.","Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results; Derek will then walk us through the details on the second quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast or capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans, and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.","In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.","So thanks again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.","Doug Parker","Thank you, Dan, and thanks everyone who are with us this morning.","Today, we are happy to report improved second quarter results for American Airlines. The company produced pre-tax income excluding special items of $1.1 billion for the quarter and a year-over-year increase in our diluted earnings per share of 10%. It's a revenue driven improvement. We saw record second quarter revenue of $12 billion as well as record second quarter total revenue per available seat mile.","The credit for producing these results goes entirely to our team, our 130,000 colleagues are doing a great job of taking care of our customers during the peak season and they're doing it despite a challenging summer. In fact the people in American are doing heroic, thanks for taking care of our customers and it shows in these results, and our projections for 2019 earnings, which have improved since our last quarter call.","But as excited as we are about the team's performance this quarter, we're even more excited about the potential at American Airlines and our potential for value creation in 2020 and beyond. The challenges we face this summer are near-term issues that absolutely will be addressed with time. And as we look to the long-term though the results we've produced despite these obstacles give us the utmost confidence in what lies ahead. And that's particularly true as we move into a period when our investments taper off significantly and the results of those investments continue to increase.","So with that I'll turn over to Derek and then Robert to give you more details and then we'll get the questions. Derek?","Derek Kerr","Thanks, Doug, and good morning everybody.","The ongoing grounding of our MAX fleet as well as operational issues caused by the weather and the union action meant that it was undoubtedly a challenging quarter for American Airlines. However thanks to the efforts of our team members we were able to produce financial results that exceeded our expectations at the start of the quarter. So I'd like to thank everyone for their hard work over the past few months.","In the second quarter, 2019 earnings press release in Form 10-Q that we filed this morning, we reported a second quarter net profit excluding net special items of $810 million, a 5.1% increase over the second quarter of 2018.","Our diluted earnings per share excluding that special items in the second quarter was $1.82 per share, up 10% from a $1.66 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.","Our second quarter 2019 pre-tax profit excluding net special items was $1.1 billion resulting in a pre-tax margin of 9% compared to 8.7% in 2018. This was the first quarter, our year-over-year margin expansion since the first quarter of 2016.","Despite the operational challenges during the quarter, our total revenues were a record for the second quarter at $12 billion, up 2.7% versus second quarter 2018. Our total revenue per ASM increased for the 13th consecutive quarter by 3.5% to $16.54 also a record for the second quarter.","We saw increased strength in demand for travel during the quarter resulted in passenger revenues increasing by 3.2% to $11 billion. Robert will give you more color on the trends we are seeing in the revenue improvements during his remarks.","Our cargo yields were slightly higher during the quarter, but year-over-year scheduled reductions and falling demand in Asia and Europe markets meant that cargo revenue fell 15.4% to $221 million despite that increase in yields.","Our loyalty program continues to grow steadily which drove other revenues up by 2.9% to $728 million. This growth was primarily due to new card acquisitions as access to the world's largest program and best network continues to be a strong incentive for new customers.","Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2019 were 1.6% higher at $10.8 billion when fuel and special items are excluded, our unit costs increased in the second quarter by 4.8% higher than previous guidance due primarily to lower than planned second quarter ASMs which declined 0.8% from 2018 as a result of the operational disruptions I mentioned earlier.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $8.2 billion in total available liquidity. So far this year, our treasury team has completed a number of transactions including securing financing for 26 new mainline and regional aircraft to be delivered in 2019 and 2020 through mortgage and sale leaseback structures. With the exception of three regional aircraft delivered in the fourth quarter, we have committed financing for all aircraft deliveries through 2019. Additionally, we have committed financing for 25 of over 2020 deliveries and we'll continue to evaluate financing options for our remaining mainline and regional aircraft deliveries.","In May 2019, we raised $750 million in an unsecured notes offering and used the proceeds to fund contributions to our defined benefit plans. In aggregate, we made contributions of $858 million to our defined benefits plan in the second quarter for total contributions of $1.2 billion year-to-date or $436 million in excess of our required contributions.","As a result, we have prefunded a portion of our 2020 requirements and our remaining minimum funding obligation for next year is now forecasted to be approximately $200 million.","Lastly, in June 2019, we completed a spare engine WTC transaction in the U.S. private placement market to raise $650 million at attractive rates which are comparable to those achieved in aircraft WTCs.","During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $44 million. We did not repurchase any stock as fuel prices remained high for much of the quarter which pushed our projected year-end liquidity near our target level of $7 billion and prices didn't fall until we had entered the closed trading window. We remain committed to returning cash above our liquidity target to our shareholders.","We continue to expect that our 2019 year-end net debt including pensions and the present value of aircraft rents will be more than $1 billion lower compared to year-end 2018. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future as our CapEx obligations normalized from the peak years of our fleet transformation program which will also result in significant free cash flow generation by the airline.","While we expect 2019 to be relatively flat in terms of free cash flow generation due to the increased pension contribution, we are currently forecasting to generate significant free cash flow in 2020 and 2021.","On July 14, we announced that we had removed the Boeing MAX from our schedules until November 2nd. Previously we were guided to a full-year negative impact to pre-tax income of approximately $350 million which was based primarily on lost revenues from scheduled reductions forced by the removal of the MAX from our operating fleet. We have now reviewed all of the data from the second quarter and given the extension of the grounding period, we now anticipate that the impact to the full-year will be approximately $400 million. We now estimate that the impact on the second quarter was approximately $175 million and estimate that the impact on the third quarter will be approximately $125 million, lower than the impact of the second quarter as we are no longer seeing the short-term disruption to passenger travel that the grounding caused in April. We remain confident in the aircraft and look forward to reintegrating the aircraft into our fleet once all of the regulatory approvals are in place.","During the June, we announced an order of 50 aircraft, Airbus A321 XLR aircraft with delivery scheduled to begin in 2023 and end in 2025. 30 of these orders were a conversion of the existing A321neo orders with the other 20 being an exercise of existing Neo options. Since the aircraft order was already part of our long-term fleet plan, it does not materially change our expectations for capital expenditures in these years. The expected range and capabilities of XLR are impressive and will add flexibility to our fleet opening up the potential for exciting new markets for our customers that we will be able to fly very efficiently.","In addition in our fleet plan filed this morning as part of our usual investor update, we announced that we have extended the operating life of some of our A320, 737, and 757 aircraft on a short-term basis. These extensions will allow us more flexibility as we deal with the grounding of the MAX and the late delivery of the A321neo's and provide modest and efficient growth to our fleet.","With the extension of MAX cancellations to November 2nd, we now anticipate capacity growth of approximately 1.5% for both the third quarter and the full-year. This is approximately half the full-year capacity we had expected at the start of the year which has put upward pressures on our unit cost expectations.","For the full-year, we now expect that our 2019 cost per ASM excluding fuel special items and new labor agreements will grow by approximately 4%. This increased from previous guidance of an increase of between 2% and 3% is driven entirely by the reduction in the anticipated ASM growth primarily driven by the MAX.","As a result, we now expect our CASM excluding fuel special items and new labor agreements will increase by approximately 5% in the third quarter and 3% in the fourth quarter.","Based on the forward curve, as of July 22nd, we are forecasting that our average fuel price will be between $2.05 and $2.10 per gallon in the third quarter for the full-year will be $2.04 to $2.09.","For revenue, we expect our total revenue per ASM will grow between 1% and 3% in the third quarter. And given the cost guidance I outlined above, we expect that third quarter pre-tax margin excluding net special items will be between 5.5% to 7.5%. We now believe that our earnings per diluted share excluding net special items will be between $4.50 to $6 in 2019 and continue to expect that we will see margin expansion in the second half of 2019.","Our total projected capital expenditures for 2019 remain unchanged at $4.4 billion comprised of $1.7 billion in non-aircraft CapEx and $2.7 billion in aircraft CapEx. We now expect total CapEx of $3.6 billion in 2020 and $2.1 billion in 2021. The guidance for 2020 and 2021 is slightly lower than the previous guidance as a result of the XLR agreement I referred to earlier in my remarks.","In conclusion, 2019 has certainly presented some unexpected challenges which have stressed our operation and put our team in some very difficult situations. But our front line team has met every challenge and done a phenomenal job of helping out our customers and supporting each other. We look forward to moving past these short-term headwinds and executing on all of the exciting projects that we have in the pipeline.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert.","Robert Isom","Thanks, Derek. Good morning everyone.","Before I begin I too would like to thank our team members for doing a great job of taking care of our customers given the issues that we've faced with our fleet in operation. Their hard work and perseverance were instrumental in our ability to generate record second quarter revenues. While we faced some significant challenges during the second quarter, we also had some notable achievements including the completion of our rollout of our industry-leading premium economy product, the expansion of our DFW hub, and the completion of our high speed Wi-Fi installation.","I'll spend some time discussing the challenges but I want to spend the majority of my time emphasizing all of the great things our team is doing and the positive momentum that we're seeing within our business.","As for challenges, as Derek mentioned in his remarks on July 14, we made the decision to extend the cancellations of our Boeing 737 MAX aircraft through November 2nd, while the return date has shifted from our original expectations, we remain optimistic that the aircraft will return to service in November.","Our confidence in Boeing, FAA, and other regulatory agencies remains intact and we are committed partners along with our Allied Pilots Association and Association of Professional Flight Attendants in this ongoing process. As always, as new information becomes available we'll assess the impact on our schedule and initiate changes as soon as possible to take best care of our customers and team.","In terms of our operation, in May, we initiated the litigation against the union representing our mechanic team members for engaging in a coordinated legal work slowdown in an effort to influence contract negotiations. That slowdown has significantly impacted the company's operations and caused a high number of flight cancellations and delays in the second quarter. A temporary restraining order enjoining the slowdown and further interruption to the company's operation was granted by the court. The court is in the process of ruling on a permanent injunction against the continuation of these illegal activities and we are waiving that decision.","Ultimately, our goal is to get back to the negotiating table where we will work to get our mechanics and fleet service team members, the industry-leading contract that they deserve just as we have with all of our other team members.","Throughout the legal work action and really for any disruptions now and in the future, our team is doing their best to take care of our customers and their co-workers. Fortunately we have new tools to help in that effort. Improved customer notifications for delays and cancellations, automated hotel meal and transportation arrangements, enhanced self-service rebooking, and snacks and amenities at the gates during longer delays are just some of the measures that are being utilized to ensure that our customers' needs are being addressed. We certainly apologize to any customers that have been inconvenienced and we want you to know that our customer relations team is working nonstop to address shortfalls in our service.","As we have discussed on several of our past earnings calls, we've been focused on improving our operating reliability. And we feel very confident that we're making significant operational improvements based on the performance of our regional operation which has not been affected by the labor issues at the mainline operation.","For example, at our hubs, our regional performance saw a 1.5 point year-over-year improvement in on time departures, a 3.2 point in year-over-year improvement in aircraft turn performance, and 1.2 point year-over-year improvement in controllable completion factor. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our regional team. This improved performance provides a nice control set and gives us confidence that the initiatives that we've put in place will be successful across the system once we move past these short-term challenges.","Now for positive momentum. We continue to take big steps forward in creating a world-class customer experience that further differentiates American from our competitors. During the second quarter, we opened our new Flagship First Dining, Flagship Lounge, and renovated Admirals Club Lounge in Terminal D at our largest airport DFW. These enhancements are just the latest in more than $200 million investment in our premium products and services and complements our other flagship lounges at JFK, Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago-O'Hare.","In addition, during the quarter, we completed installation of our high speed Wi-Fi on our entire long-term mainline narrow-body fleet of more than 700 aircrafts. This gives American more high speed Wi-Fi than any other airlines. Satellite-based Wi-Fi allows customers to stream video without buffering or interruption upload and download files with ease and do all of this from gate-to-gate. This upgraded bandwidth ensures customers will experience an uncompromised Internet connection even if every customer chooses to access in-flight entertainment at the same time. Additionally every satellite equipped aircraft can now stream Live TV and amenity that we provide access to our customers' free-of-charge. I should also point out that American is the only U.S. airline to offer Live TV on international flights.","Shifting to our network strategy. We remain focused on strengthening our network by expanding operations at our most profitable hubs. With the addition of a 100 departures in the second quarter, our DFW hub now offers more than 900 daily flights. This important milestone enables more than 9,000 one-stop travel possibilities through DFW more than any other airline hub in the world. As part of that growth, we had started service from DFW to 23 new markets including service to Dublin and Munich, and increased service to more than 80 existing markets. This growth marks the largest expansion at any hub in the United States in more than a decade.","The early results are very encouraging with margins on the newly added flights coming in at or above the system average. We remain on track with our growth plan in Charlotte next year and Reagan National in 2021.","Over the last year, we have also made a number of changes to our International network eliminating chronically underperforming flights and starting services to unserved markets across the world. Most of these new flights started in the middle of the second quarter and they are already producing margins at or above the system average.","On the partnership side, we now have final approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation for a proposed joint business agreement with Qantas which will allow us to better serve customers' flying between the United States and Australia and New Zealand. The joint business agreement allows for commercial integration between American and Qantas delivering new routes and significant customer benefits. It will also allow an expanded coacher relationship, optimized schedules on South Pacific services, better access the T20 business carrier's network -- on each carrier's networks additional frequent flier benefits and co-location at airports. All of this is designed to better serve our customers. And just yesterday, Qantas announced new services to Chicago and San Francisco from Brisbane. We are thrilled with this news to our customers and stay tuned for more route announcements from us later this year.","We also received approval from the DoT for additional service from DFW and Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda airport.","Shifting gears, our global sales and distribution team produced strong results last quarter as corporate revenue growth was in line with system revenue growth on healthy corporate demand. Our corporate volume continues to grow and further strengthened in the last six weeks of the quarter where we delivered industry-leading corporate passenger share performance without sacrificing yield. We continue to see significant growth in the small to medium business segment as evidenced by our nearly double-digit revenue growth year-over-year.","We continue to see growth across our loyalty program. Existing members are engaging with us more, redemption levels -- redemption bookings are up and we continue to increase our lead population. Most importantly, we are capturing yield growth in this lead group that outpaces our system average.","On co-branded credit cards, our strong trends in acquisitions, card spend, and overall account growth continued in the second quarter with record setting absolute results. We expected that growth will continue throughout 2019. All of this contributed to record setting second quarter revenue of $12 billion, up approximately 3% year-over-year. On a unit revenue basis, total revenue per available seat mile improved 3.5% year-over-year which marks the 11th consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for American. We estimate that our unit revenue benefited from the MAX cancellations in the second quarter. This benefit was offset by share loss in April.","We are particularly pleased with these results given the challenge we had with operational disruptions to MAX and weather. I mentioned this on our last call, but I need to say it again. In 2018, we made a big investment in our Advantage program making it more valuable to customers. We significantly increased the inventory available for redemptions in 2018, increasing the value of amounts to our customers; we are also giving our customers more flexibility to use their miles. For the second quarter, these changes had a negative impact of 0.8 units to unit revenue all of which was non-cash. We anticipate a similar impact for the remainder of the year.","Normalizing for this, our passenger unit revenue increased by 4.8% in the second quarter, two points better than our legacy competitors. We delivered improved unit revenue, unit revenue across every entity. As we mentioned on previous calls, we believe we have a unique opportunity to improve load factors without eroding yields and we have been successful in that effort to execute against that opportunity. Overall load factors were up 3.2 points in the quarter on flat yields. Higher loads without compromising yields is a winning combination. We're proud of our revenue management team for their hard work and results.","Domestic market strength was broad-based with improved unit revenue across every hub. As I mentioned earlier, our growth at DFW is performing as expected, notwithstanding exceptional operational and weather challenges at DFW during the quarter. We expect the domestic region to be our best performing entity in the third quarter.","Atlantic unit revenue grew by 3% in spite of 1.5 points of currency headwind. International point of sale remains challenging but we successfully shifted to North American point-of-sale and grew load factor by 3.8 points.","The Latin entity had the highest quarter-to-quarter improvement with unit revenue growing by 4.4% year-over-year. Brazil and Mexico were particularly strong while we faced headwinds in Argentina and the Dominican Republic. Specific unit revenue improved by half point, thanks to positive unit revenue in Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. The pricing environment for China was soft but we were able to grow load factor while we reduced our capacity and exposure to this market.","Looking forward, we expect domestic demand to remain robust. And Latin again to be the best performing international entity. We expect our third quarter year-over-year TRASM to be up 1% to 3% and our passenger revenue per ASM to be about a point better than TRASM.","In conclusion, we're incredibly excited about this airline as future; the heavy lifting of integration is behind us, our large fleet investments are winding down, and our network is being optimized with high margin growth opportunities at our most profitable hubs. We recognize the need to overcome some short-term challenges but the core business is strong.","And with that, we'd like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael Linenberg","Hello, hey good morning everyone. Two questions here and maybe they are both for Robert, at the beginning of the year you were targeting a billion of revenue improvement and $300 million of cost saves and with the MAX groundings and the labor disruption, how should we think about resizing those numbers as we move through the year?","Robert Isom","Yes, thanks Michael. So when we take a look at the revenue initiatives, we set out at the front of the year, I think the best way to take a look at is some have outperformed and others, we will be able to take a benefit of in the longer-term.","Michael Linenberg","Okay.","Robert Isom","One that has really taken a delay is identifying of our 737 and our A321 fleet because of some of the issues that we've encountered with operational disruptions related to the work slowdown, we've had to defer some of those modification lines. We anticipate picking those back up next year and that is benefit yet to come.","In terms of outperformance, some of the things that we have really emphasized certainly basic economy is producing as we had hoped and the work within our revenue management team to improve load factor performance has resulted us well. So we're seeing the $1 billion and as we take a look into the future, we're encouraged that we still have more to come. Don, do you want to add anything?","Don Casey","Yes, I will just re-emphasize what Robert said, again, kind of understand our $1 billion in revenue initiatives and how it compares; you're going to normalize for the deferred recognition rate in FFP. When you do that revenues are 4.8% which is about two points better than our kind of legacy competitors you can see where the benefit is just in there.","Derek Kerr","And Mike from a cost perspective, we have a lot of initiatives, all of them are on target the $300 million is in the forecast, so that\u2019s all built in and we are realizing those. There are a few cost headwinds obviously as you have these type of disruptions but that's built into the CASM forecasts that I gave you, so that some of them are offset by that. But the initiatives that we set out for the one airline project to get a $1 billion, $300 million this year and then another $200 million in 2020 and 2021 are all on target and are built into our forecast.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Yes sure, it's remarkable given all your headwinds that you still manage to produce margin expansion, so well done there. Just my second to Robert on the JBA with Qantas. I recall a few years back when you announced the joint venture or JBA with Japan Airlines at the time you did provide a revenue size. At that point in time when it was launched, I think it was about a $1.05 billion of revenue between you and JAL and subsequently my sense is that you've built upon that even today you highlighted some of the positive trends out of Japan. I'm sure that's helping. Can you give us a sense or magnitude of where we are from a revenue base as a starting point with Qantas? Just trying to size that joint business agreement, what our baseline is. Any color on that would be great. Thank you.","Robert Isom","Mike, it's the current size there is $1.5 billion and we don't -- we're really not sizing yet publicly the potential benefits but we do expect that this is going to be something that's positive overall. And I'm pleased with hearing of some new markets. And I would anticipate that we have more to add to that in the coming months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt Wisniewski","Hi good morning. This is actually Matt Wisniewski on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Really wanted just to expand upon the network strategy a little bit more, said it's little bit early and the DFW expansion, how should we kind of think about the improvements coming through and when would we see ultimately kind of some of the benefits hitting at the P&L?","Robert Isom","Well I will just start. We're just now getting into the real upsizing of DFW which is encouraging. So you're seeing some of the benefits already but the whole run rate of that is going to be as we progress throughout the year. As we take a look forward as I mentioned 2020, we anticipate our growth focus to be on Charlotte and so that will ramp up over the first part of next year. And then from there it's Reagan National after that in 2021. So Don or Doug, do you want to give any more color.","Don Casey","I will just say this is really just the beginning. We just started ramping up the DFW into 2Q. And we won't see the full benefit of that until we hit the third quarter. That'll obviously extend and annualize as we head into 2020 at which point we'll also be adding Charlotte which will run into 2021 and we will have an opportunity to upgauge DCA. So we have a lot of really high quality capacity network opportunities looking out for the next few years.","Doug Parker","And Matt it's Doug. I mean as Robert said in his opening remarks, the early results here are really encouraging, these markets that we have added out of Dallas as Robert said are coming in at or above system average margins as a new startup. Usually your marginal growth doesn't come in above average margins in this case they do. That just give us more encouragement to us, there's more -- there's one what we -- we believe will happen is indeed happening and two there's more of this we can do and we're looking forward to doing more as we go forward.","Matt Wisniewski","Okay, great. And then just as a quick follow-up specific capacity was down quite meaningfully this quarter and I would expect, I thought kind of anticipated revenues to kind of be more beneficial because of that. Can you provide a little more color of what\u2019s going on in the Pacific region?","Don Casey","Sure, it\u2019s Don. I'll cover that. We did that slightly positive unit revenue in the Pacific. Capacity reductions we had was the reduction of flying to China, out of Chicago, Shanghai and Beijing. We did see actually positive unit revenue growth in Hong Kong, Japan, also in Australia with more opportunities coming forward at Qantas. The China market was soft. It was our weakest performing market in the Pacific. We had about a point and a half of currency headwind as well in the Pacific as we went into the third quarter. And I think we're pretty happy that we kind of reduced our exposure to China because that's really where we're seeing some softness particularly in China upon the sell pricing where we see pretty weak pricing environment right now.","Doug Parker","And hi Matt, Doug again. So also thanks for asking that question, because it gives us chance to tell more about this. Given the kind of capacity reduction we're talking about here I think it's hard for anyone certainly for those of you who aren't here in the airlines every day to try and estimate what kind of impact that would have between revenue per ASM versus cost per ASM. And indeed when we raised our guidance a couple of weeks ago at least a number of reports suggested well, really -- it's unlike a cost story that we've done a better job of keeping our cost in check with some expected and our revenues came out in line. The reality at least for those of us who are watching results come in, the positive surprises were on revenue, not on cost again not that any of you should be able to figure that out on your own because it is such a different way this happens but indeed when our capacity is going down because we're having to -- because we're canceling flights very close in. What happens then is you're not able to particularly in the peak we're not able to protect all that revenue.","So 1.5% decline in capacity does not result in a 1.5% increase in revenue per ASM or anything close to it. And you're not able and it's pretty difficult to go find the marginal revenues or the lower revenue per ASM as you do that. So at any rate that's what we experienced as the quarter came through as even though ASMs were down the fact that our earnings came out better than we thought, it was to us a revenue surprise not a cost surprise.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is open.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody and thank you very much for your time. I have two questions. My first question is what percent of your fleet do you normally replace every year and how does this year compare to a normal year?","Derek Kerr","I wouldn't say percent but we replaced somewhere. It's been a lot more over the past few years. We've taken deliveries of over 100 aircraft a year for many years in a row since we've gotten here for about five years. This year we're replacing about 65. Next year will be about 61 and that includes regional also. So the steady state would be somewhere between 40 and 50 if you cap a -- the average age where it is. So I think that's kind of where we're at. And so when we talk about aircraft CapEx going forward it comes down significantly in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, steady state would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 aircraft a year when you get out into the 2025 to 2030 range.","Doug Parker","Helane, a good way for us to again make the point, it's a hard question for us because there is no normal. There certainly hasn't been since the merger as Derek said we've been bringing in 85 to 100 airplanes each year and then retiring a similar amount in this by far the most aggressive modernization of a commercial airline fleet in the history of commercial aviation.","So that has been the number and that's now largely behind us. So as we've been doing that also the CapEx we've had to put into integration and the CapEx that we put into all the improvements that have been needed to make into our airline that tapers not as strong enough. That comes down significantly as Derek said in the coming years both aircraft CapEx and in some of the non-aircraft CapEx. So we get the benefits of all that investment -- amount of investment in the quarter.","Helane Becker ","Okay. And then, so then to follow that up the $1 billion dollars in debt pay down that I think Derek mentioned, should we think about that as accelerating through the next five or seven years as your kind of steady state declines from 100 aircraft to 50 aircraft?","Derek Kerr","From a debt pay down perspective, we have our normal debt pay down schedule which is somewhere between $3 billion a year over the next few years, so that pay down does not accelerate. I think there are pay down of WTCs and other debts that we have. But as you look at our pay down schedule from in 2019, we'll pay off $3.7 billion of debt in 2020, we have $2.7 billion due, 2021 we have $4.2 billion due. So it runs around $3 billion to $4 billion of debt that's paid off. That scheduled debt pay downs that go along with the pension payments but that's all in the numbers that Doug talked about when we talk about free cash flow that's all assumed that those debt payments are paid in each one of those years and that we pay off debt as it comes due.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay","Thanks. Good morning everybody. A question about that comment you made about the market share loss in April. Can you give me some color on that comment what you mean by that? Where was it? What type of share was it? And how do you get that back?","Don Casey","Sure, Hunter, it\u2019s Don. When we had ended up grounding the MAX, there was a lot of schedule uncertainty as to how long this was going to last and how we're going to move aircraft around to try and cover this. And so during that period sort of really starting mid-March through what the third week in April, we did see close in bookings and close-in bookings particularly for corporate travel lag, right. So we definitely lost share. We definitely saw some book away during that time period to our competitors. That did bounce back by the time we got through April and in fact, if you look at the last six weeks of our kind of corporate share performance, we are number one in the industry in terms of corporate share. So that's really complete bounce back for us. But it was entirely just a response to schedule uncertainty, if you wanted to get your meeting during that time period sometimes people are choosing not to fly, so they weren't sure whether they're going to change our scheduling.","Hunter Keay","Okay, fair enough. Thank you, Don. And then, Doug, when you think about the relationship between employees buying in reliable operations and consistent cost performance that's arguably the three areas that you guys need to show the most improvement. And if we assume all three of those things kind of feed into one another which order do they have to get fixed and how do you get started with the first one?","Doug Parker","Employee buying in and then reverse.","Hunter Keay","Either way I mean you can define in any order you want. So it's buy in operations and just good cost performance, so like which one has to start first and which one sort of manifest into the other two getting better and how do you start it?","Doug Parker","Yes. I will start on -- I'm not exactly sure I'd characterize it that way but I'd love to talk about the employee perspective, you're getting again I mean first of all let me just go to the operations. In this -- we as a company and under Robert's leadership have made great strides in our operations reliability from the time emerging airlines improving every year up until 2018, we had a setback last summer unrelated -- related primarily to things like six engines, things we tried to do our best to fly through and didn't make change to the schedule and in retrospect, we realized that we were kind of letting the operation to be the buffer not something go. In retrospect we would have made the same decision going forward. ","So in response to that, we put in place again with Robert's leadership, David Seymour's leadership, Carey\u2019s leadership a huge operational reliability improvement plan for 2019. And again we did those things that made a large difference in our ability to manage through what we're dealing with now. So we feel really good about where we are in terms of operational reliability but for, what we're dealing with at the current time which is a huge increase in the aircraft out of service to begin the day. That when we're as we are today having to start the day with so many airplanes -- more airplanes out of service than we have spares. By definition that means you're starting the day by canceling some flights and by definition that means it's not going to be a particularly good operating reliability. So that's the situation with operational reliability. Not to say there's not more we can do and won't do to improve it. But once that issue -- once that issue is removed, I'll say it this way we believe it will work for that issue. We would be running the best airline in the history of American Airlines which was our goal for this year.","And all the data that we have supports that. As Robert noted, we're seeing that on the regional side where we don't have this issue. So operational reliability, I feel extremely good about where we are and our trajectory going forward. We do need to get to the near-term issue.","So as it relates to culture anyway I think I know -- I guess you're getting out or maybe not, if it's not you tell me. But anyway, it's a fair question and thanks for asking how what we're going through relates to all the work we have underway on cultural transformation.","I will tell you the cultural initiatives that we've put in place since the time of the merger. And again remember back when we put these two airlines together five-and-a-half years ago, how big an issue that was particularly given the history of American Airlines and those things are working, we've made huge strides thanks to really good leadership. The people that I get to work with, who led our team, who every time that I most -- when I go out and talk to team members prior to the merger, it was all about this company doesn't care about me. Now as we go out and talk to people, we still have issues but they're rarely that actually they aren't that. To the extent, their issues they're all about desire for more tools to do the job, the way they know how to do it to take care of their customers which is exactly where you'd like the team. And exactly what our job is to deliver to them.","So look there's more to do there with cultural transformation obviously takes some time, it takes a lot of time. But we're really pleased with the progress we've made to-date and we'll continue to make in the future. Our objective here is to make culture a competitive advantage not just to improve the culture, not just to transform it from what wasn't a very strong one to one is really strong but to make it so strong that people actually prefer to fly American. That's not -- that's not -- we're not there yet. That's aspirational and longer-term objective. One we are committed to and one that we think is best for our shareholders.","So that work continues but really happy with the progress. I think again fair to ask, if that's the case and why are you going to this issue right now to which side -- to which I would tell you look, while that culture work goes on, there's no change the fact that this is a highly unionized airline and union negotiations will continue to be union negotiations and some of them we haven't even gotten through the first one yet. And this is one amazingly enough, this is we're still working on joint collective bargaining agreement with this Union and we hopefully to get that done. We obviously get them done quite quickly with all of our other workers. And indeed we're beginning negotiations on contracts that we signed five years ago JVs with pilots and flight attendants today.","So it's a source of frustration for sure. And but look this is a different animal one that we're still trying to work through. But unlike the other contracts we work through, we're dealing with two Unions here chose to form one Union and sign association partnership. We're dealing with international Unions where the primary decision makers aren't even American Airlines team members. So the culture doesn't make that much of a difference as far as they're concerned.","So look we will work through this, we'll get through a contract and that's the real goal here of course is to make sure we get a contract in place when we do that. We're going to have a long-term contract with our outstanding mechanics and fleet service team members. That's going to be industry-leading and that will be a good day. So that'll help significantly but we need to get through this joint agreement with this group. And right now we haven\u2019t been able to get through that.","I will add I'm sorry for the long answer but I will add on that front, certainly with the way we get into a joint collective bargaining agreement is to get back to talking to each other. These negotiations are under the control of the National Mediation Board at this time which is a good thing; the bad thing is the National Mediation Board hasn't called a negotiating session since April because of that.","You can ask them why but the fact is they haven't. And as a result we haven't -- we haven't had talks good news as we just heard last night from the NMB, they'd like to have a status conference with all of us on August 15th. That's really good news. By that time we think we'll probably have a permanent injunction in place which will help with what we're dealing with. The goal of this is not to have people coming to work and doing their jobs because the goal is we have people coming to work and doing their jobs because we are excited about the company and the future of the company. And to do that we need to get a contract in place. We're trying to do that. We're working extremely hard at it and I know that we'll get one. I can't tell you exactly when we will get to a contract and this issue that we're dealing with today will be behind us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Doug Parker","Hi Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey thanks, good morning. Sorry if I missed it in your prepared remarks but when do you expect a decision on the injunction?","Doug Parker","Steve Johnson?","Steve Johnson","Hi, you never know for sure but my guess would be late next week or early the week after that.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you. And then just as a follow-up as you think about this cost of the MAX grounding which you've estimated at $400 million relative to perhaps your future aircraft order book value of about $3.5 billion, is the right way to think about potential compensation as a discount to that future value to maybe 10% to 12% discount on your existing order book as we sit here today?","Doug Parker","We wouldn't encourage you to think about it in anyway because we don't know; we haven't had any discussions with our partners at Boeing about the details of how this compensation might occur. We saw as I know you did, they satisfied they put a reserve aside. We've had high level conversations with the highest levels of Boeing about what our expectations are but we haven't had any detailed conversations about how those expectations will be met.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan McKenzie","Hey thanks. Good morning. Healthy corporate demand that's strengthened the last six weeks in the quarter despite some severe operational disruptions that's a surprise. But we know there's a direct link between business travel and operations. So the idea book away when operations are bad. So the question is I wonder if you can elaborate on any book away challenges in the third quarter outlook, how they might be a headwind or an opportunity at some point here and does the current outlook embed some book away?","Doug Parker","Thanks. I will let Dan give you the specifics but again I just want to reiterate just what Robert said in his comments. While this is going on our team is doing really, really great work to make sure while we have operational disruption. It's not felt nearly to a degree it would be otherwise by our customers first and foremost is once we realize that this was well a near-term issue, one that was going to be going on for a matter of weeks and months, we begun the process and that continues not waiting until the day of to do cancellations but do them several days in advance that allows us to reaccommodate customers again not the best thing you want to do but much better than having customers find that their travel has been disrupted on the day of the airport.","So that makes a big difference and then as we do that particularly as it relates and Robert trying to tell more about this probably isn't reached through our most frequent fliers making sure that they are having -- they are having the least impact of all and to the extent they are, they know that the company is reaching out to them. So we're working really hard on those issues. Don, is there anything in terms of?","Don Casey","Yes, I will just add that. We have actually been tracking completion factor for our corporate customers which is we have been canceling flights but kind of which flights we are cancelling relative to that kind of travel patterns of our corporate customers on a year-over-year basis. There has not been a very material change in the completion factor for corporate customers. So we've done a good job of figuring out kind of what to cancel as it pertains to the outlook, we aren't really seeing anything right now that would cause any book away and we expect our performance for domestic in the third quarter to be pretty similar maybe even a touch better than it was in the second quarter.","Derek Kerr","I'll just give a shout out to our sales team and our customer relations team as well with any issues; we have opened up new means of communicating to ensure that any issues are addressed. And I've also stepped up our efforts to be out there with our corporate clients and that includes our Head of Sales Allison Taylor and myself and a number of the other executives here. So we're hearing firsthand of where the issues as we can get in front of them whenever possible.","Dan McKenzie","Very good. Good job, second question here is we do have a tale of two economies. Obviously, we've got the industrial which is slowing and the consumer which is strong and we've seen this in prior years as well and I guess I'm just wondering if you can talk about how you think one affecting the other at some point if they do, what are the key metrics that give you confidence that demand can continue to remain firm here and at this point are you sort of revising any implicit fourth quarter revenue assumptions?","Don Casey","Again if you don\u2019t look at kind of what's been happening, right. We've seen some softness right in international fund sales, right. Some of that's currency. Some of that's economy. But the domestic market has remained very robust. We've been able to backfill really any international shortfalls with higher yielding domestic originating business. And we've been able to successfully grow our load factor maturely, we are up actually two points overall in the second quarter and we're up really in every entity. As we look forward, I mean we're actually booked ahead as we look forward into future months and we're not seeing really anything that wouldn't make us concerned at this point around continued strength in domestic demand.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie Baker","Hey good morning everybody. Most of my questions have been asked and well answered. So one from me, I know it's the view of your aviators that some of the reliability issues are related to scheduling practices and maybe some IP deficiencies. This is a difficult one for me to reconcile with the data that I have access to. So I guess the question is whether you believe, are you extracting all the potential efficiency of the current pilot contract and whether there is some IP investment that does need to be made if so what might that cost?","Derek Kerr","So Jamie thanks for the question. That's the good news at least for all of us in this, there is I still believe a tremendous upside so in our operation. So while we are dealing with the mechanic slowdown in weather anomalies, and you name it we're finally getting the chance to run an integrated airline and as we do that with all of our systems, we're able to move past the point of just integration to taking a look at what the next generation of systems are.","So when we take a look at scheduling practices, we know that there are potential efficiencies that we can bring about that potentially saves on flight times. We know that for our pilots and flight attendants that there are ways that we can meet their needs in actually creating more lifestyle, improved schedules that should also reduce the impact of redundancies and reserve levels. And we know that there's a lot more work that we can do on aircraft routing as well now that we have the system all in one place.","And don't forget even when it comes to maintenance operations, we still are operating with a couple of different systems out there. So restricting ourselves in some way, so more upside is how I view things and thanks for bringing it up because I think the opportunity for investment is good and the payoff will be nice when we get to it.","Jamie Baker","Any guess on timing and thank you very much.","Derek Kerr","So in terms of timing, 2020 will be a year in which we have our eyes firmly on operations improvement especially in regard to efficiency. So it's going to be over the next few years. There are some larger longer-term issues in terms of flight management systems and crew scheduling systems where we'll have to move past some of the legacy systems and think about next-generation. But there's many improvements we can make along the way and Maya do you want to add any here?","Maya Leibman","No, I think we are always working on improving our systems. It's just an ongoing aspect of what we do.","Jamie Baker","Okay, thank you.","Derek Kerr","The good news for us is we have a lot of upside here.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Kevin Crissey","Hey good morning everybody. Thank you for the time. Maybe if I could ask you to fast forward past this week, we've surpassed this being the MAX, the mechanics let's look out whether it'd be 2020 or 2021 but let's just if we can start with 2020 not looking for specific guidance by any stretch at all but broad strokes as to what all the changes in 2019 does to your 2020 capacity cost structure, should we see the kind of the inverse of the negative impacts in 2019 as it relates to 2020 on a year-over-year basis. How should we think about that?","Doug Parker","Well without giving any guidance to you guys we haven't -- we're not prepared to give just yet. On a global basis and I think in terms of what it means for growth next year, it's certainly two things going on one you have growth being stifled this year for these issues that won't. And then on top of that, we've told you the growth that we've put in place, the growth that we plan to put in place is doing exceptionally well. So you should expect us to continue along that. So this will be -- will certainly be a growing airline as we move into 2020.","And then what that means again setting aside economic issues that may or may not happen, what it means for us, we think is the ability to certainly view the industry is probably the best way to think about it because who knows what happens to global issues vis-\u00e0-vis the industry and now we think as that happens for all the reasons, we've talked for a lot of the reason we talked about which is upside that Robert is talking about, I think we would hope that on that growth, you'd see our unit revenues improve at a rate that's greater even than the industry. And our cost as Derek has described staying well in check. And that should result in things like we would hope margin improvement and certainly improve -- more improvement than the group in total.","And If I'm remotely right about that because of what they're striving in terms of our CapEx profile that that results in real cash flow generation and certainly more than I think you'll see from our competitors.","Kevin Crissey","Yes, thank you for that. And we are obviously looking for a good CASM next year; I've been a little hopeful that it would be this year. Wasn't sure about next year, this maybe creates the opportunity for that. Go ahead, I'm sorry.","Doug Parker","More to come on that, we agree.","Kevin Crissey","Okay, thank you. And maybe for Don, can you talk about the transatlantic outlook. There's been some commentary about it being softer. Maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks or during Q&A and if it is softer as we look to Q3 and beyond, why that's the case?","Don Casey","Sure. I guess here is the way I would describe it. We've seen some softness again in Europe point-of-sale in terms of both demand and yields. Again the domestic markets been strong. We've been able to backfill that in growing unit revenue. Again we were up 3% in the second quarter and that's what one and half points of currency headwind. Third quarter, we don't have quite as much headroom in the load factor side year-over-year. But if you go and look out into the fourth quarter on the Atlantic industry capacity is growing at the lowest rate since it hasn't since 2012. So we are really seeing kind of moderating and lower industry capacity. And in particular, the capacity that's coming out of the Atlantic as we head into the fall and winter is really low cost carrier, low price carriers right that are taking the capacity out. So I think the Atlantic although it's -- we see softness in Europe point-of-sale. I think the capacity profile as we move forward is actually quite positive and we would expect that to start to translate into improved yields in the economy cabin as we head into the next winter.","Kevin Crissey","Excellent. Thanks. And if I could sneak in one more with -- you haven't talked about Miami. When we look at the data, the South Florida region looks soft internationally. Is that kind of an area of weakness for you? You talked a lot about regions that were above system average. I assume that might be one that might be below?","Don Casey","No actually been quite good for us. Actually for us Miami is our gateway to Latin America. Brazil was very, very strong, Caribbean was good, Mexico was very, very strong. We had over 20% revenue growth in Mexico. And so our profile in Miami actually is -- actually we're quite encouraged by Miami. And it was actually our best performing unit revenue in the third quarter or second quarter.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Okay. And our first question from the media comes from Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News. Your line is open.","Mary Schlangenstein","I wanted to see Don, you've been talking a lot about demand but can you talk a little bit more in detail about domestic demand whether you're surprised at how it's held up and specifically what you think is fueling that ongoing strong demand?","Don Casey","I mean, domestic demand has been strong now for a long time, right. This is something that just happened overnight. And as I mentioned earlier when we look at going forward, we expect that we're seeing nothing right off the trend line that we've seen for domestic. So again I don't think we can type anything, kind any recency in terms of anything that's happened domestic has been in this place now for quite a while and then there's nothing again that we see that's going to take us off this trend line.","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay. And if I can also ask about the A321neo delays, JetBlue talked this week about hearing of additional delays from Airbus. And can you talk about where you guys are at. How many planes you've had delayed and if there have been any additional either time delays or aircraft delays for you?","Derek Kerr","Mary, this is Derek. We have not heard of any additional delays. We had conversations with Airbus probably a month ago and we looked at the schedule and got those deliveries all set up as part of the XLR negotiations. So that's been set. I haven't heard of any further delays at this point in time but we'll check back in with Airbus after hearing those conversations to make sure that our aircraft are as planned from our XLR negotiations where we re-spread them a little bit from the original delivery dates.","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay. Can you say how many A321neos are involved?","Derek Kerr","It's more like there's about I think there was five to 10 that just got delayed and then they just pushed the whole schedule out a little bit. So somewhere in that range or the amount that have been delayed but what we did is as part of our negotiations, is just re-spread them to put them in order where Airbus can deliver and we can plan a little bit better.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Chris [indiscernible] from CBS News. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Guys thanks for the time today. Real quick, can you talk about you mentioned that you're having to cancel some flights in [indiscernible]?","Doug Parker","Hi Chris, we completely lost you.","Unidentified Analyst","I was asking how many flights you had to cancel because the mechanics issue if you have added daily number we\u2019ve seen where you are to that in addition to the MAX?","Don Casey","Chris, so what I tell you is as Doug mentioned every morning we're seeing a lot of more aircraft out of service than had been planned and we're taking actions to address that. So I can't give you a specific number everyday but it's certainly been impactful, the operation in some days we've gotten it most days we were way in front of it. So that we're addressing customers' needs. But that can be in the number -- it can be in the dozens of flights a day.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And when you look at correctly the MAX Southwest puts it back in January. How confident are you in November timeline. Obviously confident enough you didn't change it but did you see that as realistic before the holidays. Or you have some level of expectation that lingers into January?","Don Casey","We're staying in close contact with both Boeing and the FAA. And I think is up to speed as anybody and as matter of fact Boeing had their earnings call yesterday and I was in touch with their team last night afterwards. So from what we heard a month or so ago we really haven't -- we don't have any new information leads us to make changes. But we're staying close and we'll certainly assess based on what we know today, we should be able to hit the timeline of being back up in November.","Doug Parker","We will continue to reassess as we move forward. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison [indiscernible] of Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. I was curious if you could say whether you've had any -- done any additional work looking at how customers are feeling about the MAX right now. Do you have the sense that sentiment has evolved one way or the other as the grounding instruction?","Doug Parker","Allison we don't really have any answer to that directly that question is no, we don't have anything specific to give you any insight. Certainly what we know is this, when the FAA declares that this aircraft is safe to fly, it will be safe to fly and when American pilots declare that they are comfortable flying, it will fly. And what I know is our customers will view those two things as extremely important in their view about whether or not the airplane is safe to fly. And so until that time, I'm certain there any customer survey data would show some concerns. I believe once we get to that point those will be largely mitigated and certainly well over time but nothing that we can tell you specifically today about where they are.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, thanks. And I guess is there anything you're hoping from Boeing in terms of sort of like rehabilitating its brand or restoring trust and confidence in aircraft. Is there anything you're hoping they'll do on that front?","Doug Parker","Again what is most important to us is that the airplane has been recertified and because the FAA has come to the conclusion that everything that led them to ground the aircraft has been mitigated. When that happens and our pilots believe they are adequately trained to fly the aircraft and has now -- has been certified. That's what we are focused upon and we believe those two set of events more than anything else will make the difference in our consumer attitudes about the aircraft itself.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Koenig of The Associated Press. Your line is open.","David Koenig","Hi, good morning. I'm sorry. I'm going to probably kick the same dead horse that Allison was kicking. But let me put it another way. Well first of all, Doug, if you could explain a little bit more you said that you had some conversations with the highest levels of Boeing about what your expectations are relating to compensation. Can you say that's new to [indiscernible] or something less than that. If it's Robert talking to somebody or whatever. And then secondly what's your campaign going to be to convince passengers to get on the plane beyond FAA and your pilot showing confidence in the plane what are you going to do?","Doug Parker","David, no further information on who's talking to who. Anyway we have a great relationship with Boeing and they're a great partner and we didn\u2019t suspect they will continue to be great partners as we work through all of this. We certainly have been today. So that's where we are with as it relates to Boeing and again --","Robert Isom","And Dave, I just say that one piece of planning that I think is noteworthy is that, we anticipate sometime between the aircraft being ungrounded and when we actually put the aircraft into commercial service where our pilots and flight attendants will get reacquainted with the aircraft and will actually be flying some level of our team members around. And so I think that that is going to be helpful.","But as Doug has said the biggest thing is having our pilots and flight attendants and team all behind this and ultimately flying this aircraft is going to be something that is going to be a big part of our fleet. And we look forward to taking advantage of all the capabilities that it offers once it's recertified.","David Koenig","Are you going to have any kind of advertising campaign though?","Robert Isom","We don't anticipate that at this time. Again I think the biggest thing is being able to provide really comfortable and certainly reliable service and that's what when this aircraft is recertified and our team members are out behind it. And I think that that will be something that is a hallmark of this aircraft going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Your line is open.","Leslie Josephs","Hi good morning everybody. Just a question on hiring Southwest talks about some issues with hiring pilots because of the 737 MAX grounding and some promotion classes. Are you seeing anything similar with that?","Robert Isom","No. The good news is that American is a fantastic place to work and we have really for all categories of our team members. We have people that want to join the team and we're certainly monitoring the pilot sourcing for our regional carriers. But we feel really confident there as well that we have the scheduling practices and compensation tools to be able to track the team members that we need.","Leslie Josephs","Okay. And just one follow-up for passengers who maybe don't want to fly the MAX once it returns or maybe wait a few months for it to fly safely. Is there any way that they can get out of those reservations or without paying a change fee or cancellation fee; is that something you're looking at this from some of the other airlines as well?","Robert Isom","Like others we will be sure to make the appropriate accommodations but over the long run, this is an aircraft that is going to be out in service and flying well and we anticipate that everybody's needs to be taken care of.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Doug Parker for the closing remarks.","Doug Parker","Excellent. Thanks everybody. Thanks for your interest and thanks for sticking with us through this. Any further questions let either Corporate Communications or Investor Relations now. Thanks for your time. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."]}}
