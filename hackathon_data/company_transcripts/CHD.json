These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in the detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. We're uptown this year. We normally have this conference at the New York Stock Exchange; it's under construction this year. So, next year we'll be back. Rick Dierker is with me today, our new CFO. We have the entire management team here as well. We'll come up here when we're done with the presentation and they'll be available for Q&A. So, let's begin.","So we have the obligatory Safe Harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read it. And here is the agenda. I'm going to talk about who we are, the categories that are most important to us, that will be laundry and vitamins, how we deliver, how we run the company, and then Rick is going to take everybody through the financials.","Okay. Here is what you're going to hear today. I'm just going to pull it all up on the screen for you viewers at home, but the short story goes like this. We had a terrific 2015. So we had 8% EPS growth, and on an all-in basis, it's 12% local currency. We had full year organic sales growth of 3.6%. This puts us well above our evergreen target of 3%. We had a strong finish as we saw the consumer business grow 3.3% in the fourth quarter and we have really good momentum going into 2016.","Our new product pipeline is off to a good start. You can ask Lou a few questions about that when we get to Q&A, and we expect 3% organic revenue growth again in 2016. On the EPS front, 2016 outlook is again up 7% to 9% all-in, and that's 9% to 11% on a total currency basis. That's top since CBG as you know.","We announced the dividend increase today, that's to keep our payout ratio at 40%. And finally, we closed a small bolt-on acquisition in early January. We're always on the hunt for good brand acquisitions, so we're excited about the future. So let's begin.","Okay. Church & Dwight was founded in 1846, so we have our 170th birthday coming up this year. And in 19th century, it was founded with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Today, we have 10 brands that drive our revenues and profits. These are our 10 power brands. In the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. All nine of those other brands were acquired, since the year 2000.","Our most recent power brand is now BATISTE. BATISTE is a business, the dry shampoo that we bought in 2011, and in 2016 the global sales of that brand will cross $100 million. Okay, those 10 brands drive our revenues and profits, 80% of our sales and over 80% of our profits. And of those 10, four are mega brands. These are four strong brands that have the ability to go into adjacent categories. And of those mega brands, those mega brands drive 60% of our revenue and over 60% of our profits.","As I said, we are an acquirer. Those are the nine brands that we've acquired. And as you can see also, we generally are focused on number one brand. Okay, we're primarily a U.S. companies today; 82% U.S., 18% International. This has the benefit of having minimal exposure to the weakening foreign economies. And we're very balanced, about half Personal Care and half Household with Specialty Products' business rounding it out at 8%. Okay, we are in the land of the giants. So we are a small company. In 2016, we'll have about $3.5 billion in sales, small company but big returns. So the shareholder return one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year period been stellar for our shareholders.","Let's talk about the categories that are important to us. So first, laundry. So here is the depiction of the laundry category for the past four years, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. As you can see, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, both the total category and the liquid category declined in each of those three years. That turned around in 2015, particularly in the second half. So on a full year basis, the total categories up 1.6% and liquid up 0.7%. One of the added benefits of 2014, going to 2015, it was actually a stable promotional environment, so that contributed to the rise.","Let's continue on the second category I want to talk about is vitamins. As you know, in 2012 we acquired the Avid business, that got us into gummy vitamins. Why were we attracted to gummy vitamins? It's because it's been a fast growing category. In fact the vitamin, mineral and supplement category has been a mid-single-digit grower for many, many years. That flattened out in 2014. Why? Because of negative press and the growth has been rekindled again in 2015. So the category is growing.","The other thing I want you to focus on is the gummy form. So the reason this is attractive is because pills and capsules becoming less popular and gummies are becoming more popular. So if you look in 2012, you can see only 7% of the category was gummy. Today it's 12%. And if you look at how did the gummy form grow in 2015, it grew 16%. And the good news is that we are the number one brand in both adult and in children's vitamins, gummy vitamins.","Okay. Here's the one I want to end on as far as trends go. This is dry shampoo. As I mentioned earlier that we acquired BATISTE in 2011 and in 2016, we're going to cross $100 million in sales. We're the number one dry shampoo in the UK and in the U.S. In the UK, we have a 75% share; in U.S. we have a 15% share, round numbers. So here's the interesting factoid. So the UK has a retail category of $60 million with a population of 65 million. In the U.S. where the dry shampoo category is in the early innings, it's only a $90 million category. We have a population of 319 million. So we see a lot of runway ahead of us in this category and for this brand.","Okay how we deliver? If you're a shareholder, you're well aware of the 10 drivers of shareholder return, let's review.","First, we have a recession-resistant portfolio. This is very important. So we have a portfolio that's going to perform well in any economy, 60% premium and 40% value. Okay here's an illustration of some of our products. You can see in many cases, our value brand is about 50%, less expensive than the premium brand.","Now let's talk about new products. Okay first up is ARM & HAMMER. So we're really excited about our 2016 product offerings. On the left hand side, you see CLUMP & SEAL, so we have a new variant coming to CLUMP & SEAL, that's CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. Now MicroGuard not only seals and destroys odors, but it also prevents future bacterial odors.","On the right hand side, see BioEnzyme. So we have a new laundry variant in detergent and that's BioEnzyme. It's formulated to meet the Safer Choice environmental standards promulgated by the EPA. The third thing, it's not on the screen is that we also have a dual chamber pod that we're launching under the ARM & HAMMER banner in 2016. A little bit more on CLUMP & SEAL. So, in 2015 we came out with lightweight and naturals followed by MicroGuard in 2016, but here's a story that's worth telling. We have been an innovator in cat litter for years. So if you go back to 2011, you see Double Duty followed by Ultra Last. And you see what happens when you don't have innovation in the year, you flat line. So in 2014, we came out with CLUMP & SEAL, the best cat litter that's out there. In 2015, we follow with naturals and lightweight, and then 2016, we follow with MicroGuard. Great story.","[Video Presentation] (08:27-09:00)","Okay. Let's keep going. Let's turn to OXICLEAN. A couple of things on OXICLEAN this year. So we have a new liquid laundry detergent called OXICLEAN Preserve. This laundry detergent reduces pilling in your clothing. And just as we have a dual chamber pod for ARM & HAMMER, we also have one for OXICLEAN, called OXICLEAN HD.","Just let's review the OXICLEAN mega brands for a minute, so to start with laundry additives. So laundry additives, we had a record share 45.9% up 130 basis points led by White Revive, which was our entry into the bleach category. Second is the laundry detergent. We ended the year with a 1% share. We had a 0.8% share at the end of 2014. It's not moving as fast as we had hoped. The good news is that trial, repeat and consumption are all up year-over-year. And then finally auto dish detergent category. It's a difficult category. We've got 1.3% share in 2015.","Okay, TROJAN. Three new offerings for TROJAN, first condoms. So we have TROJAN GROOVE, so this is a grooved condom that retains the lubricant on the condom during sex. Number two is TROJAN RIVIERA for those of you have been waiting for a lubricant for use in the shower, you now have one, so long-lasting lubrication. And the third one is TROJAN Divine, which is a multispeed vibrating massager. I'm not sure if one, two or all three of these are in your goody bags today. That'll be a little bit of a surprise.","Okay. Vitamins; so lots of new products in the vitamins space, so first beauty. So a new beauty line with really attractive new packaging, also a couple offerings for teens both teen sport and also teen hair, skin and nails and then licenses. Licenses have become increasingly important in the children's category. So we had Barbie and Mario launch in 2015, and then this month we have Minions as well, so that bodes well for our children's gummy vitamin.","And finally first response, so there is now a Bluetooth Pregnancy Test Kit. So you download the app to your iPhone. You use the pregnancy kit. It sends a result to your app. And what the app does for you? It provides you lots of information throughout your pregnancy. So we've all heard about the Internet of Things, so this is our first foray into the Internet of Things, so it's our ability to test and learn.","All right. Marketing, so you've often heard us talk about how much money we spend on marketing. We're the 15th largest advertiser in the U.S. So we're in pretty good company here as you can see on the slide. And we've also said that our marketing would generally bang around between 12% and 13% of sales. So you can see over the last four years we've averaged around 12.5%. And it's going to show-up in your shares. So if I call your attention to the right hand side of this slide, this is our report card. So on the top, you have your mega brands and in the bottom you have your remaining power brands. So, three out of four of our mega brands grew share in 2015.","Vitamins is yellow. Why? We went sideways this past year. It's well-known. We had some difficulties with the new plant start-up, that's well behind us now. And then with respect to the other six power brands, you see XTRA is red, but actually XTRA profits were up in 2015 versus 2014, as we didn't chase the competition down in discounting, and battery-operated toothbrushes has been a perennial difficult category, that's also red, but seven out of 10 were green.","Okay, distribution. So this is a new information for you. We took a look at our distribution gains over the past six years. So we looked at 2009 to 2012, and then separately 2012 to 2015. So we're happy to report that we've been consistent in expanding our distribution year after year after year. We expect to continue to do this in the future. And while we're on the topic of distribution, BATISTE with a 15.2% share today, that share is only going to grow because we're expanding top retailers in 2016, another good story.","Okay, defense of our brands. It's no secret that the laundry category has been a difficult category for all competitors for several years now. So in 2014, you had Simply Tide show-up in the value tier, 2015 had Persil show-up in the premium tier; and on top of that you have price wars breaking out. So what happened? So, just left to right; in 2013 we had a 14% share; 2014, 14.2% share; 2015 14.4% share. So in each of the past years, we've expanded share in spite of the new entrants in the price wars; and we expect to continue expand share in the future.","International. So just as I said in the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. Near 2001, we were just a U.S. company. Today, we're a little bit more diverse, 82% as I said early is U.S., and 18% is International. This is how it's spread out. We have a European business unit, which is our largest business unit that encompasses the UK and France. That's 37% of the business, followed by number two Canada, then Mexico and Australia. Our International business has been a stellar performer for many years. If you look at the CAGR for the last five years, virtually every business, every country is at or above our 3% evergreen target.","Now, gross margin. So here is a six-year look at gross margin. So if you think about the first three years, 2010, 2011, 2012, we're all still dealing with the commodity super cycle, so that was depressing margins. And then, more recently you had price wars break out. And that's a bit of an offset from commodity abatement, but we've been around 44.5% gross margins for good long time, in spite of all those factors.","The four ways we drive gross margin, this is familiar to many of our shareholders and we'll go clockwise here. So good to great, that's the name of our continuous improvement program. Second is supply chain optimization. As you know, we've built a couple of plants in the last five years. Number three, new products. So, when we launch new products, those new products need to have higher than average gross margins. And finally, acquisitions. And when we buy, one of our requirements is that we buy businesses that at or above are existing corporate gross margin. Okay.","And as you know we have a very simple compensation structure, we promote financial literacy within the company. One of the ways we do that is we tie gross margin is \u2013 25% of all employees' annual bonus is tied to us achieving the gross margin target.","Next is acquisitions. So we have a very strict criteria with respect to acquisitions. Consequently, we're very fussy about the brands and the businesses we're going to buy and this criteria hasn't changed in quite a few years.","Long history of acquisitions, obviously that contributed to our top-line growth. 2004, we were about $1.5 billion; we're $3.5 billion today. Good chuck of that was driven by acquisitions. And a good way to think about Church & Dwight is an acquisition platform. So when we acquire businesses, we grow the revenue and we get cost energies. So, how do we do that? So with respect to the revenue growth, we have veteran marketers within the company. We have a separate new product development process, separate from the business units. And as a result we expand shares. As far as the cost synergies go, we'll leverage the new brand across all classes of trade, and we have a supply chain and R&D organization that are very versatile. So we can handle liquid, aerosols, powders, gels, devices et cetera. And our track record is stellar in nine out of 10 power brands so we get costs synergies every time. And Rick's going to tell a little bit more about access to capital when he gets up here.","Okay, how have we done? So if we acquire a business, what was the pre-acquisitions share, what's the share today? In every case, you see that we expand shares.","And topic you probably read in the release that we acquired this brand earlier this month; we were entering the hair thinning category. This is a problem solution brand. If you think about the characteristics of it, we think it's very much like the teeth. We had a couple of non-CHD investors agreed to demo the product, here's the male, before and after. And here's a woman before-and-after. And happily if you've retained more than 50% of your hair, and you know who you are, particularly sell-side analysts, this product is for you. A nice side benefit of this by the way is that, they have a very robust sales and marketing team online. So, we're going to learn a lot from them. If you want to learn more about the product, you can go to toppik.com.","Okay. Best-in-class free cash flow, Rick's going to take you through that, but we've averaged well above our peers for many years. SG&A, this is a hallmark of the company. You can see that we have extremely productive employees and we're the lowest SG&A of any CPG company and we intend to stay there.","We have expert management team with lots of people, lots of experience in all of these seats and driven by a simple compensation program. I said earlier, that gross margin is 25% of the annual bonus. The rest is cash from operations, EPS and net revenue, very easy to explain, very easy to remember and our long-term compensation is a 100% stock options and we're all required to be heavily invested in the company's stock.","And here are the results again. So stellar returns to our shareholders over the one-year, three-year, five-year and 10 year-period. Okay. How we run the company? We have an evergreen model. So we always target 3% organic growth annually and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and we're targeting 8% EPS growth.","Okay. As far as our operating system goes, first is the evergreen model; second is we know what geographies we're focusing on, North America first, that's Canada, U.S. and Mexico and secondarily Europe and Asia. Allocation to capital, Rick's going to take you through but at top of the list and these are in order of importance, is TSR accretive acquisitions. And finally those acquisition criteria haven't changed in years and we have four operating principles.","So, we have number one brands that we leverage, we're very asset-light, we're not capital intensive, we generate lots of cash flow so we leverage assets and we have very productive employees, the most productive employees in the CPG space. All of that combines for good returns, but when you leverage acquisitions on top of that, you get spectacular returns.","Okay. Now I'm going to bring Rick up here to talk about financials.","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Thank you, Matt. I'm going to cover three topics. We're going talk about the quarter, Q4, and just how we came in. We'll go through 2015, and some of the details there. Then talk about 2015 outlook, but there's one theme to take away from the financials today, that truly 2015 ended well and we have a lot of momentum as we go into 2016, lot of optimism.","So Q4, 2.6% organic sales growth. 3.3% for the Consumer Domestic division, largely driven by volume. We'll get into the details in a second, the 2.5% volume growth. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points behind commodity improvement, behind our productivity programs, a lot of our price in the laundry is normalized, the same theme you've been hearing about all year long.","Marketing was down 10 basis points, so essentially flat, and SG&A was up 10 basis points. So operating margin was up 50 basis points. So EPS is up 5%, and currency neutral EPS is up 9%. Great result.","So through the quarters of 2015, pretty consistent; 2.6% in Q4 remember versus a year ago, we were at 5.2%. So really strong growth in Q4 off of a high comp year ago.","You guys like to look at the stack bars, so, we threw in in here for consumer business. This is just the strength \u2013 relative strength of the consumer business, a lot of momentum going into Q4, 7.2% in Q4. So, we're exiting the year at a strong rate. Categories are strong.","So, volume is the growth driver, 2.5%, at a 2.6% from the organic side for the company; 3.2% for the domestic division. With international division, we do get a little price as we go into the FX headwinds. And then SPD, we're down 4%, largely on volume because no prices have come down.","Great trend, great momentum on gross margin as well, 45.5% for the quarter, and as I said before, normalized pricing environment. Commodities are a tailwind, and productivity programs continue, and a lot of our vitamin issues for start-up happened earlier in the year.","Marketing spend, highest percentage, highest dollar amount of the year. And that leads to share growth, seven out of our 10 power brands, and Matt walked you through those details, three or four megabrands grew as well.","So, let's recap on the full year, 3.5% organic sales growth, compares to 3% outlook earlier in the year, largely volume-driven. Gross margin is up 40 basis points, for all the reasons I already walked through. Marketing is down 30 basis points; now, we talked about that a little bit on our Q3 call. We reallocated some of the marketing spend and put it in the trade line for OXICLEAN to drive trial, and as Matt alluded to, trial and consumption are both up.","Adjusted SG&A is flat, and operating margins are up 70 basis points, so great result. EPS is up 8% and free cash flow is a record at $544 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversions, 125%. That is a very important metric to the company. We'll be talking about that even more as we go forward, and that should be very important to every shareholder as well.","So, why can we drive great cash flow productivity is because partly of working capital improvement. Our cash conversion cycle, which is inventory, which is receivables minus payables, has gone from 40 days to 27 days over the last five years. We continue to believe that we can continue to make that go down over time.","Free cash flow conversions, 125% in 2015, average for the last five years, 119%; so just stellar result. We did dip our toe in the water in 2015 on AR factoring, so that isn't that 125%. If we take that out, we're still at 119%. So, as Matt alluded to, 118% for the last seven years or so, which is far above the industry average and far above some other competitors who target 90%.","We have a strong balance sheet, 1.4 times levered. Why is that important? It's important because we have a lot of fire power, a lot of dry powder waiting to do an acquisition. In this example, we could do a $2.8 billion deal and maintain our credit rating.","Okay. So that's 2015. So why don't we go through 2016. First, organic 3%. So, there's couple of things behind that number. So, that'll be SPD, 1% to 3% type of growth; International, 4% growth; and for the consumer business, domestically 2% to 3%. And you might ask why is that coming down from 3.5% in 2015? There's really two assumptions in there. One is, the international business comes back down to earth. We had a phenomenal year this year behind Steven Cugine and his team, 8% going to 4%, so back down to earth there. And then the categories, our assumption for that is growth of 2% to 3%. So if categories are doing better, then our top line will do better as well.","Gross margin, 40 basis points of expansion. The easy way to think about that is really 70 basis points from productivity programs, from commodities, not having any of the start-up costs for York, for the vitamin plant, offset by about a 30 basis point drag from currency. And I'll walk you through it when we talk about currency a little bit more, but we have a 30 basis point drag largely because of transactional currency impacts from the U.S. to Canada.","Marketing is flat, but there is a little bit more of a story there as well. SG&A is down 10 basis points, leveraging the top line, operating margins up 50 basis points, EPS, 7% to 9%, currency adjusted 9% to 11%. And then we have a share count number for you, 131 million, what's behind that, $300 million of buyback, and we've already gotten ahead ourselves of $100 million in December, so $200 million left for 2016.","Okay. Here's how we stack up versus our evergreen TSR Model of 3%. You can tell we've hit or beat that 3% number over time. Focus on gross margin, absolutely 2010 to 2014 in the face of commodity headwinds, in the face of laundry competitiveness, we maintained our gross margin. In 2015, we expanded and we're going to expand again in 2016.","Consistent marketing spend, so 12.3% to 12.3%. So, I just want to leave you guys with this comment. The core business we're increasing marketing spend by around 10 basis points, okay. Where a lot of our competition is cutting 20%, we're actually increasing our core business and the marketing spend associated with that. When we layer on the TOPPIK acquisition, it is a $30 million deal, about a third of that revenue is direct, so the marketing spend is a little bit lower. So when you do the math, it becomes 12.3% to 12.3%.","SG&A management is the hallmark of the company. Our people do great things here. This is leveraging the top line, many companies do zero-based planning process, I'd say we've been doing this for many, many years.","Operating profit, 2015 was a big year, we hit 20%. So, a lot of personal care premium companies are in the neighborhood of 20%. So we're happy to be there. And then in 2016, we think we're going to expand by 50 basis points again.","Now, EBITDA is a good surrogate for cash generation and we think the stair step tells the Church & Dwight story very well; so we've gone from 20%s to the mid-20%s, 24.2%.","For EPS, we're $3.48 to $3.54, that's the range of 7% to 9%. Again, once you back out the currency is 9% to 11%.","Okay. Here's the FX story. So, in 2015, as a refresher, we had about a 2.5% drag in currency on the top line and a 4% drag for EPS. That was a 30 bps impact on gross margin. In 2016, we had a 1% drag for revenue and a 2% drag on EPS. But we still have a 30 bps drag from gross margin. And that might surprise you, I would just tell you that in 2015, 70% of the drag for currency was translation, and in 2016, 70% is transaction. So that's more of a gross margin impact.","Okay, allocation of capital. Number one, by far, TSR-accretive M&A. We want to do the \u2013 we look at deals all the time. The management team, the senior leadership team, we look for deals all the time. You'd be shocked with how much time we actually spend on that. What I want to leave you with though is we're looking for the right deal, and it's number one, but we want to make sure it's the right deal.","Number two is new product development that drives our organic growth. Number three is CapEx. Number four is return of cash to shareholders through dividends and buyback. And number five is debt reduction.","We are not a capital-intensive company. In 2016, our outlook is really $55 million of CapEx. You might say, hey, Rick, you guys have typically been high-$50 millions, low-$70 millions. And I'd say, no, the base business was actually in the $50 millions. And then when we have incremental capacity to manage for vitamins or for a new plant, that's when we spike up to higher number.","And then, as Matt alluded to, a 6% dividend increase to $1.42. That gives us right at our 40% payout ratio that we have been very clear on from many years.","And with that, I'll welcome up the rest of the management team and we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay, do we have microphones for people? Oh. We do. Okay, Bill. (29:26)","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. As you highlighted both in the release and a couple of times, the kind of momentum exiting the year, can you just give us a little more color, and I guess particularly, do you see something in vitamins, as you finally get the plant issues behind you that you can maybe point to, where we have momentum going into this year?","And also talk about the laundry category, with more competition with Persil, with \u2013 what you're seeing with XTRA? I mean, help me understand how you're seeing momentum as we move into 2016 for that as well.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So it's a typical multipart question.","Unknown Speaker","In one part, yeah.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So first off, so, vitamins. So, right, vitamins, we went sideways this past year. We had issues with supplying customers. We had poor service levels. We had a lot of people unhappy with us. We had \u2013 we didn't promote our products. We cut back on advertising, so \u2013 because we couldn't service customers. That is behind us now. So now we have lots of new products coming out as I reviewed with you. Customers are jazzed about it. And we're going to get new products on shelf in 2016. So, we're going to benefit from the tailwind of the category starting to grow again. So I feel really great about vitamins. What was your second one? Second was...","Unknown Speaker","Laundry.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So laundry, so look, laundry down three years in a row. And now, suddenly we had three quarters in a row where the laundry category is growing. So there is more money being spent on laundry, so consumers are willing to spend a bigger pot of money. So that's good news. When a category expands, you're right in that there is new competition in there with Persil. That was certainly not something we saw coming, as was into the category us having then OXICLEAN premium laundry detergent. But you know we're not giving up on OXICLEAN. We have obviously the new two variants coming out this year with the preserve product, and also the pods \u2013 the dual chamber pods, and don't underestimate that.","So remember, we had a powder pod for many years. We focused on liquid, and we didn't put a lot of effort behind the pod side of the business. We're coming out with a dual chamber this year, because consumers are looking for multiple benefits, and you need multiple chambers. So, we think the innovation is going to help us there.","With respect to unit dose, there is no question that Procter has dominated that, same story, right. We have a new product this year, the dual chamber and that's going to help us.","Yes. Let's go on this side, Bill (31:58)?","Unknown Speaker","We talked a little bit on it briefly, but could you guys do a better job bridging the gross margins, so the puts and takes this year, because it sounds like there was a like a fairly significant hit from the vitamins stuff? But just given where the commodities are now and probably some mix lift from BATISTE and acquisition growing much faster. I know they're small, but they are massive gross margins. So how are you going to, like, get into 40 bps for the guidance?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I've completely forgotten everything about that I've learned in finance. So, I'm going hand this off to...","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Right, right.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","...our CFO, Rick Dierker.","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thank you, Matt. Well, we tried to illuminate for you a little bit, Bill, (32:35) about the transactional drag of 30 basis points of it. While commodities \u2013 the core commodities like resins, surfactants and paper are all down, that's a tailwind of course, other costs are still up, transportation and labor and everything else. So, everyone wants to talk about the pure commodity piece, but other costs still \u2013 there still is inflation in the business.","Mix of BATISTE, yeah, that's helpful, Personal Care margins, and they are down. And like you said, vitamin costs are behind us. We never really quantified that. We said it was about the size of a breadbox is the quote. So by and large, it's really \u2013 commodities do benefit us. Productivity programs do benefit us. Mix does benefit. But there are some other headwinds like FX and everything else I just said. Okay.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, great. And then just to follow-up on the vitamin stuff. You did like 3%-plus or minus growth last year in scanned channels, how much do you think you lost because of the capacity outages and the allocation? And now you got it fully up like you can sort of support all the orders you're going to get now with the new supply chain, and maybe what you think that sort of 3% goes to?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean you'd assume that if the category grew 3% in 2015, at a minimal what we lost is we're going to hold share, all right? So, that would be our surrogate for that.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let's go, right here, second row.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Can you comment on vitamin margins. So, versus the average as you get the vitamin business growing again and you're investing, is that actually a negative mix shift that would be affecting gross margins and so on?","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, Caroline, it's a good question. Remember, a year ago, we told you that we had actually got our vitamin margins up to the corporate average. That was prior to the investment of the new plant, right. We said, hey, we're going to invest all this capital and fix the right structure for all this future growth. 75% increase in capacity, and we have to grow our way into it over a few years. And so as we grow into our way into it, the margins for vitamins are again below the company average. But we think that with the growth over time, then we'll get back to or above company average.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. And if I might just on the international, if you could, there have been some markets that are \u2013 where the consumer is very, very weak. Is your business small enough that you can still grow in that environment overseas?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Steve, do you want to take a swing at that one?","Steven P. Cugine - Executive Vice President Global New Products Innovation","Yeah, sure. I would say that our business in developed markets has been quite strong actually. So, Europe delivered strong high-single digit domestic growth behind launch of new products, BATISTE, Femfresh. Emerging markets has been something where we've really performed well and you saw from Matt's chart, Mexico in particular is a good sub for us, that's double-digit growth. And then export markets, an area that we really focused on has delivered double-digit growth as well.","So, we are feeling pretty confident relative to international playing a strong contributing role in the company's overall growth rate.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","So, Jason, you look like you have the mic. So...","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","That's \u2013 you got the power.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks. So, obviously, your operating margins are best in class. So, when you talk about aggressive but achievable guidance for 2016, the balance between sales and EPS growth, how can you \u2013 I guess, what are some of the levers you can kind of lean on in case sales do come in little bit lighter because of the macro backdrop. I know you got the recession kind of part of the portfolio. But this is a question that we ask you every couple of years when things start to look a little gloomier out there. But I was just wondering if, as you continue to impress us with the margins, like, how do you think about the next levers that you can lean on.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, we always have the same answer to you by the way, because you have asked this before. So, it's always a what if. So, what if there is some pressure on the top line. Well, obviously, it's always, we know where all the discretionary costs are in the company. So, even with the 12% SG&A, that's always something you can reach for. So, that's always the first stop on the train. And that the last stop on the train is going to be marketing.","So, as you saw in the release, our marketing spend was $417 million in 2015; and a year before it was $416 million. So, we did not cut marketing this past year. On a reported basis and on a local currency basis, it went up. So, we're very committed to holding the marketing where it is, but as seen it would be the first stop on a train. And you know we have a very creative supply chain organization as well that's trying to find ways to lower the cost per unit.","Go to Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. So, two unrelated questions, first, good to see innovation on the unit dose front. Can you possibly frame and maybe you don't want to comment, what the trajectory of that looks like? So, Matt, you've made the comment in the past that you intend to get your fair share in unit dose. So, over what period of time should investors sort of expect to see that?","And then unrelated question for Rick, you commented on free cash flow conversions. You guys have done a tremendous job on that. What's the runway there? How long can you guys maintain free cash flow conversion like a 115%, maybe even north of that like you did this year? Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, with respect to unit dose and our share today is 2.6%. We said okay, what's your share of ARM & HAMMER today of the total category, it's a 9%. So, clearly we're away under index there.","Now, in some accounts, we have a five share, and other accounts we have a zero, we're voids. So, obviously, it is possible to grow, and in some cases, we're already at 5%.","As far as the crystal ball goes, it's very difficult to say what the trajectory is, going from a power towards dual-chamber, we think is going to be a big help to the brand. We'd probably be better able to address that question in six months or nine months; let's see how successful we are with the dual-chamber.","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","And in terms of free cash flow and the runway, so same way we have TSR model for the P&L, I feel like we have kind of an operating model for cash flow generation, whether it's working capital or CapEx, whatever it is. So, I'd say, if \u2013 the pure operating model organically for the business, we have years of runway. But the good thing about Church & Dwight and the acquisition platform that we are is when we buy businesses, we just don't have synergies from a P&L perspective, we have it from a working capital perspective too. So, as long as we buy businesses and that's our strategy, then the runway is going to be there for a long time.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Kevin, I'd like add \u2013 build on something that Matt said. So, I don't want anybody in the room to think we're taking our eye off the liquid business. So, we will continue to support the liquid business moving forward. But as Matt articulated, we're putting a lot of emphasis on building our share in the unit dose. So, I think that should make you happy. I know that's one of the questions you asked me for real. And so, but I don't want you to think we're taking our eye off the liquid business either.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. You pick, Joe. How about, Joe?","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just going back to gross margin for a second, what are you baking in in terms of the promotional environment, particularly in laundry and litter, for example, which is a category that you've done very well? And how do we think about the quarterly progression this year, because your competitors get tougher, but the transactional impact of that, that should ease as well?","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so on a promotional perspective, right, promotional spending is pretty consistent with the year ago. But remember in Q4 this year, promotional volume for laundry, for example came down from 36% in Q3 to 33% in Q4. So, that we believe the trends are going to be pretty consistent year-over-year for both laundry and litter, nothing surprising in other competitive launches, but we have competitive launches as well. And the other one was transactional currency, and just timing of when that's \u2013 it's as you would expect, it's probably more front-half weighted, because currency rates, spot rates are pretty much unchanged now versus what they were in late Q4. So, it's more front-half weighted than back-half.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, even though the competitors get tougher throughout the year, you think you see more expansion in the back-half on the gross margin side?","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Oh!, for gross margin...","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I thought your conversation was more on the top line. So, gross margin, it's pretty actually balanced throughout the year. We're going to \u2013 we said called an expansion in Q1. So I'd tell you gross margin is potentially pretty balanced throughout the year.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just one quick one on the balance sheet, the inventories were up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter?","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Right. No doubt. Working capital was phenomenal. I think your cash conversion cycle was down to 26 days, inventory was going the wrong way. Part of that is our vitamin business, right, and we want to make sure we're not cutting customers and our fill rates are 99.7%, but we've probably over-corrected there, but over time, we'll bring that back in line, but for now it's great where it's at.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Joe. This side. And then, you can pass it down to Lauren when you're done.","Unknown Speaker","Sure. Maybe. Can you talk a little bit more about the distribution slide. I thought that was a great slide, and I didn't realize actually that you had gained that much distribution for something like liquid detergent. Can you tell us kind of, maybe for detergent and cat litter and vitamins, those are the three categories I care the most about, what inning are you in? How much more distribution expansion is there to be had?","And then sort of related to that, particularly on vitamins, the innovation is awesome, but the trade-off is the rest, that there are too many SKUs on the shelf. So how are you managing that and what's retailer response been? Are they giving you enough shelf space to take all of that assortment?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","I am going to let Lou comment on the distribution gains, because he does take a bow for that particular slide and Lou will tell you that the game is never over and we're always in the middle innings.","Louis H. Tursi - Executive Vice President-North America Sales","No, thanks, Matt. So first of all, I'd like to answer by saying, it's a team effort from everybody, all functions. It really helps a salesperson when you're out at retail and when you have great innovation to sell against. Secondly, supported by a marketing team that really believes in the products that we have. If you put that combination together and a great sales team, and you deliver the results that Matt showed on that slide.","All the modules aren't done and completed yet in 2016. But we are expecting very similar, there is nothing \u2013 the ones that we are hearing about are all positive and in line, that we have. But I really would put my hat off to everybody else at this table, because it requires all of us to work together to get those results.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And the other part of your question was vitamins. So, yeah, you're right, it's a very crowded space. And, obviously, as I said before in 2015, we didn't get any new products on shelf because of our own issues. But the retailers are very excited about us when you're the number one brand. So we have over 30% share, both in adult and in children's gummy vitamins, that's all outlets. We have the ability to a get product on shelf. And so, if you have the innovation, you're going to get the shelf space.","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, one thing to add on that. So if you remember last year, it was difficult year for us with the start-up of the plant issues that we had. And we took a very measured approach to 2015 that being, as you know, vitamins is a category that's highly promoted. And so, since we're having trouble supplying to retailers, we cut back on some of those promotions in 2015, that we would put back in in 2016.","And so also when you're having trouble supplying the customer, no one is looking to really expand on your distribution base, right. So we have those opportunities \u2013 missed opportunities from 2015 that will be carried into 2016.","You saw the innovation platform that we have for 2016 and we feel very confident on that.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So just following up actually on vitamins and this would apply to OXICLEAN as well. Sometimes I think when you launch new products, clearly your P&L structure can afford a lot, but I am curious the cost of keeping things on shelf, when I look like in the Nielsen data at some of the vitamin products you've launched over the years, the different variants beyond like the basic multivitamin, they kind of get shared then they lose it, right? And that's been a pretty repeated pattern when you look at the sort of not SKU-by-SKU but the title-by-title in the Nielsen data on vitamins. So what's the cost to keep stuff on shelf when it's not really felling through? What pressure are you under from retailers to get it out, and get something new and the same would go for OXICLEAN. So when the retailers where 20 basis points of share gain this will be starting year three, how easy is it to keep it on shelf when you're at those share levels?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Lou, you can add to this but I want to give you some color with respect to vitamins. So, when you think about vitamins, there are lots of different variants. It's lots of different vitamins, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, et cetera, and there is also some specialty vitamins as well. Multivitamins in general, round numbers at 40% of the vitamin category, so that's sort of your anchor. So that one is the one you pay the most attention to. And it is common knowledge within the company that you can have a lot of SKUs which drives the supply chain guys crazy that need to be on shelf because some consumers are looking for them.","So that is the way to think about it. And yeah, you're right. Some things cost money to get on shelf; you may have to pay slotting, et cetera. We do have a process that meets monthly, just SKU rationalization team, so we're always looking at these and say okay, is this something we should take off-shelf. And in 2015, we did eliminate a half a dozen SKUs for exactly the reason that you're pointing out. Anything you want to add to that, Lou?","Louis H. Tursi - Executive Vice President-North America Sales","The only addition would be that this is a category where you have to stay on trend, and so we continually innovate in this class, in this business. We will continue to do so. So you do need a good mixture of the base business that Matt talked about and continuing to add productive ideas that are on trend, and deleting some non-productive SKUs as you go forward.","On OXICLEAN, you asked an OXICLEAN question, I would step back and provide this input because there're a lot of really good things; I think, we all should feel terrific about. Those being as Matt showed, the category is growing again, right so first time in a while that's happened.","Second big thing is that, there are two new premium products in the category. That's a good thing for a couple of reasons, one being it promotes healthy competitive environment; and two, it allows us to build our business. And last year, if you remember on OXICLEAN, we said we would incrementally spend against that brand, and we did, and as Matt showed on his slide, our consumption is up 25%, our trial is up about 50% and our repeat purchase is up about 40%. So although it's a difficult environment because consumers are used to buying for over 50 years one particular brand, we believe in our brand, we will continue to support that brand moving forward.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then can I get one more on the M&A?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sorry. Thanks. No one took the microphone.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It was on TOPPIK, and I guess when you showed the list of acquisitions, the two that don't get mentioned in the recent past would be I guess FELINE PINE and then REPHRESH and REPLENS from last year. So just, I guess one, a big picture question on M&A. When you set out to look at these brands be they tuck-in or big scale, do you have a vision for whether or not you think they're going to be a power brand one day, right. So like BATISTE \u2013 or BATISTE and FELINE PINE the same on day one and BATISTE just really worked and FELINE PINE less so. Like, are there roles that the different acquisitions are meant to play when you bring them in? And then where would TOPPIK kind of fit in that continuum?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, okay. So SIMPLY SALINE, so we acquired SIMPLY SALINE a couple of years ago. For those of you who don't know, that's a nasal hygiene product. And keep in mind that we have the number one nasal hygiene product in Europe, that's called STERIMAR.","So we thought, hey, you know we know a little bit about this category. It's not only successful in Europe, but it's successful in export markets. This is a pretty safe move for us to move into nasal hygiene. Now, has it caught on in the U.S. the way it is in other countries? No. But it's a high margin business, no plant came along with it, so we thought okay this makes some sense for us.","FELINE PINE, it was a number one or number two natural cat litter that was really in vogue at the time. When we looked at it, we said, hey this looks like one that might make some sense for us, again no plant, it's co-packed. So we had the criteria and we had \u2013 it was a solid brand that one hasn't taken off. But when you buy it, when we're looking at trends to see does it make sense, you mention REPHRESH and REPLENS. So a year ago, we buy REPHRESH and REPLENS. So this is the number one gel, vaginal moisturizer, people with that issue will look high and low for a product that's going to solve their problem. So, again problem solution brand. We put some money behind that as soon as we bought it and it's grown really nicely in 2015. So we're real happy about that acquisition.","And coming back to TOPPIK again from solution, we learned a lot about the hair category through BATISTE. We're not going to get into be a shampoo company, liquid shampoo, but we feel really good about hair thinning and that is an issue that you don't have a good solution there, because today the big brand in hair thinning is ROGAINE, it's a J&J product and it's putting chemicals, right. And if you look at the consumer research, people aren't happy with what offerings are out there to solve the problem. And we think TOPPIK, if you go online look at Amazon, some of the reviews for their product, people love it. And this business has people that have been customers for 20 years. So again, it's the kind of thing we say, hey this looks like a really solid brand. It's not going to go backwards. It's going to grow quite a bit and again asset-light, high margins, throws off a lot of cash.","Steven P. Cugine - Executive Vice President Global New Products Innovation","Matt, can I add something to that.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure.","Steven P. Cugine - Executive Vice President Global New Products Innovation","For each acquisition, we really do a deep dive and look at what the global opportunities are. So when you look at something like FELINE PINE, we know that's really a domestic U.S. play period, and does it work with the portfolio that we have. I'll take out BATISTE as an example or TOPPIK. TOPPIK, a third of their sales are in fact in international markets with good overlay over what we do today and it complements our capability to deliver in specialty Personal Care Products. I would say, REPHRESH, REPLENS internationally off to a very good start as well.","Again, we do a lot of a doctor detailing, for example in international markets. We feel that's a great product for us. We have a great way to access those markets and educate doctors on the benefits of these great products. So, we have a model per acquisition in terms of where we think we can play and how to win.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay, it's a good add. One more up here.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks for taking my question. So recently in the news has been more negative commentary following the PBS documentary on vitamins and supplements. Just wanted to get a sense of whether you guys have seen any impact on your business related to that?","Steven P. Cugine - Executive Vice President Global New Products Innovation","Well, you know what the results were for this past year. We went sideways. I think the only way to react at that is just to look at what happened to the category. It continued to grow in 2015 and it's growing in the first quarter. So I would say, no, then \u2013 by the way that has generally been the reason why the category has flattened out, because there was a lot of press in 2014 and you saw up on the screen today it flattened out that year with the category.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And the second question on the BATISTE. You highlighted in your slide an opportunity to expand with your top retailers this year. Just want to get a sense of what your penetration is currently with those retailers?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","With these top retailers?","Unknown Speaker","Yeah.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Next to zero for some of them. So when I said we had a 15.2% share, that's going to grow in 2016. So we have voids in other words.","Louis H. Tursi - Executive Vice President-North America Sales","So I'll add to that. So clearly when we bought BATISTE, it was more of an International opportunity, and so there is kind of a reversal what Steve said where we're all looking at it globally, but it started more in out of states and we bought it to United States about 18 months ago. We're very pleased to say within the United States that we became the number one dry shampoo brand in the United States in that short window of time. And that's been through a constant charge from our group and our team across all functions to deliver the best products out there which we think we have and there's a lot of distribution opportunities still in front of us.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Here's another fun fact for you is that, remember we said that the retail category for dry shampoo is $90 million in 2015. In 2014 it was $60 million. So it's grown significantly year-over-year.","Anybody else? Jason (54:53). Oh...","Unknown Speaker","Sorry. Jason (54:55), I'll come back.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","You're the next.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you, guys. Thank you for the question. Congratulations on a strong finish to the year. I want to come back to the gross margin questions we had earlier. Pricing appears to be a dramatic swing factor in your resumption of gross margin growth last year where the first time in many years you reported positive price growth. You kind of closed out the year with a little bit of price leakage. What drove the price leakage into the year? As we think about moving into 2016, what should we expect in the price line of the P&L?","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I wouldn't characterize it as \u2013 so here's the story on price. If you think back, Q4 year ago was when we started saying it was normalized pricing environment in laundry. So Q1, Q2, Q3 on paper looks like favorable pricing year-over-year in 2015 versus 2014, but that was just the normalized pricing environment. So in Q4, there wasn't \u2013 you're comping a time period that didn't have any pricing difference. So in general I'd say, 2015 versus 2014 was the absence of the competitiveness in the pricing laundry category. 2016 as I said earlier, I think, it's going to be very comparable to 2015.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Steve?","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Just \u2013 you touched upon to some degree on OXICLEAN. You talked about how you're behind where you want to be one share or just over. I think last year you'd said you want to be at two. So I'm just trying to figure out where you are in that arc and how much additional commitment in terms of trade or spending behind that brand we should expect as we track it in 2016?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Well as we've said, we're not going away when it comes to OXICLEAN. So as you know in the second half of 2015, we took some money out of marketing and put it up in the promotional spend area, do wanted to promote trial. We're going to need to continue to do that in the future. Does that help you?","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","It does. So, we should expect that to continue on?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're going to need to do that, definitely.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, are there other pockets of \u2013 should we expect, I'm assuming, those are going to get additional promotional support, maybe vitamins as it comes back. Are there pockets where we should be expecting and looking for year-over-year increases and integration?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Well, typically we're going to put the muscle behind the new products. So some of the new products you saw up today, generally, their first quarter is our lowest marketing spend quarter and it picks up in Q2. So we move marketing around depending on where our new products are landing.","Louis H. Tursi - Executive Vice President-North America Sales","Yeah. It would be incorrect to walk out of here to think that our promotional spend is up year-over-year and is essentially flat year-over-year. All the commodity benefits are now being piled back into price issues in the category.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Caroline?","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. You talk about this BioEnzyme product formulated to meet Safer Choice. Can you elaborate on what that is? And is there are any pressures from environmental group store, any sort of ingredients that look to be under pressure right now?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. We have somebody who's been waiting for that question for about 45 minutes now and that's Paul Siracusa, our Head of R&D.","Paul A. Siracusa - Executive VP-Global Research & Development","Thank you. The Safer Choice logo or label is an EPA designation. There's plenty of green or partner organizations out there that try to certify the safety and efficacy and environmental compatibility of products. The EPA has a program used to be called design for the environment. It never gained a lot of traction because the consumers didn't have a clue what it was for. So they repurpose their whole program. They went on and talked to consumers, and then came back with a Safer Choice approach, which means all the chemicals in there have to be certified by the EPA to be best-in-class from a consumer toxicity, from a environmental toxicity, and biodegradability perspective. So you have to formulate to those targets, and that's we've done with the BioEnzyme product. So we wanted to go after efficacy with the BioEnzymes. So it's an enzyme-based product that does great cleaning and strain removal. At the same time, we did it with materials that meet the EPA's Safer Choice program.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","And are there opportunities to do this in other brands that you have?","Paul A. Siracusa - Executive VP-Global Research & Development","You could do it across the line if you want to formulate to these targets. And what we're doing inside the company is we're looking for where those opportunities make the most sense because ARM & HAMMER is a safe brand to begin with. So differentiating safer and safest is a difficult challenge, as you can imagine, but we took this approach because we added enzymes into the ARM & HAMMER franchise, which were never there before.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","And I'm just jumping topic to last question. On vitamins, and gummy vitamins, private label is a big sector in that category, is there any other category where you compete with the private labels as big and how do you do things differently just in the face of private label?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean with respect to private label, the way to compete with private label frankly is your features and benefits. So if you keep your features and benefits different than private label, you're going to be able to command the premium and we do compete in private label and lots of categories. So for example in baking soda, 25% is private label, the cat litter is for high-teens in private label. So we're no strangers to private label. And by the way in vitamins it's pretty stable. It's been around 12% of the category.","Okay. Well coming up on \u2013 Bill (01:00:30), did you have one more important question? Your last question, so make it a good one.","Unknown Speaker","Well since you did that, I will turn it to Britta since you're new. Can you just talk, actually as you're looking since you're new to the role, what you're looking at in marketing and advertising and actually from a cost standpoint. Is there any changes in terms of TV versus print versus digital which you're doing differently. So as we look into marketing spend being kind of flat year-over-year really there's some savings that you're actually getting, can you may be talk about your approach and then costs?","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Britta before you answer, let me just introduce Britta. So, Britta Bomhard is our EVP of Marketing. She's Chief Marketing Officer for the company. She just joined us earlier this month. Bruce Fleming lead a stellar career with Church & Dwight, retired at the end of 2015. And Britta comes to us from our European business. So she ran our European operation, which is most 37% of the International business with fabulous results. And you can tell the folks a little bit more about your background and then help Bill (01:01:39) with his question.","Britta Bomhard - EVP Chief Marketing Officer","Hi, guys. Well, thank you. So I think coming back to that question, I am three weeks into the job. I'd say it's a little bit early or you can tell if you look at the results that we've seen, very successful with the approach we have. And I would like to compliment my predecessor, Bruce Fleming, on the kind of parameter he had set up, very clear longevity on brand assets and on communication. Yeah. So I would say, this isn't broke. This is a winning formula we currently have. Obviously, we all look at ways of optimizing. I will do that in due course, but currently I would say it's a winning formula. There's no reason to upset the apple cart, it's not a nice American expression.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Very nice. You got that our of our \u2013 your book this morning, right...","Britta Bomhard - EVP Chief Marketing Officer","Yep. American-isms.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. And just to build on that, I think one of the things was a kind of side question is what are we spending on digital and has that changed much over the years? And it has, but we were around 26% in 2015. We'll be a little higher, 27% is what we're targeting right now. So it's about a quarter of our spend. Going back a few years, five years ago, it was less than 10%, so we're moving in that direction.","Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","I want to thank everybody for coming today. We're going to wrap it up. We're about an hour now, and we'll talk to you again at the end of the first quarter, and we'll see you again next year at the exchange. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that, on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in the detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, today. I'll provide some color on the quarter, and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. When Rick is finished, we'll have a Q&A session.","So reported growth was 11.2%, which reflects strong organic growth and the Waterpik acquisition. We're very pleased with the organic sales growth of 3.2%. That was driven by 7.1% volume growth domestically. Our targeted investment spending has translated into share growth, as 7 out of our 11 power brands exceeded or met category growth. Both the International Consumer business and the Specialty Products business turned in really strong numbers. We're on track to achieve 8.5% full year earnings growth.","Our International Consumer business exceeded our expectations with 6.2% organic growth. As you know, we continue to invest in our international business to sustain our long-term algorithm of 6% organic growth. Last year, we opened new offices in Singapore and Panama to support our export business. In August of this year, we established a new subsidiary in Germany to expand our European business. And over the last 12 months, we have been taking a hard look at Asia and the best approach to that region. There will be a lot more to come on this topic in the future.","Our Specialty Products business had a strong quarter with 7.5% organic growth. U.S. dairy farm profitability remains at a higher level than a year ago. We are starting to get more traction outside of dairy in poultry and cattle. The acquisition of the Agro BioSciences business earlier this year is an important building block for animal productivity business. We've seen good growth for the probiotics products \u2013 that's a tongue twister. We have seen good growth for the probiotics products in the poultry industry and our new business development efforts in the dairy industry are translating into new sales.","Turning, now, to some of our domestic categories, the laundry category declined 30 bps in Q3, driven by higher promotional levels and slower unit dose category growth, yet our laundry business grew 380 basis points in consumption. Once again, we were able to grow share in the quarter. That momentum has carried into October \u2013 and by the way, October promotional levels have also come back in line. ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent grew share for the 31st consecutive quarter. OXICLEAN laundry detergent gained share sequentially with improved efficacy claims and packaging.","And now, finally, unit dose, behind our new Triple Chamber unit dose innovation, our consumption has outpaced the unit dose category rate for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Q3, ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew six times the category rate. Our total unit dose share, all in for all brands, is now 4.9%.","In litter, the clumping litter category grew 4.6%, and the ARM & HAMMER consumption grew 5.4% and gained share. Our new litter innovation, SLIDE, has already reached 4% share (3:47) of the clumping litter segment and we grew share 60 bps in the quarter. SLIDE has a greater six-month repeat customer purchase rate than the last 14 category launches that we've had, except for Clump & Seal, which is slightly better. So, we feel good about the future of the SLIDE product.","The dry shampoo category grew 33% in Q3. The dry shampoo category is now $140 million in the U.S. BATISTE grew 9.5 share points to a 33% share. BATISTE has the strongest brand loyalty of any dry shampoo in the category, including brands with significant hair care heritage.","Now turning to gummies, the adult gummy category grew 13% in the quarter, while our business grew consumption approximately 2%. vitafusion, which is our adult gummy business, is contending with significant competitive discounting. There's been a lot of BOGOs going on in gummy vitamins. We haven't been participating, so that's been slowing our growth.","The condom category declined in consumption by 2.7% in the quarter. TROJAN Condom share in measured channels was down, although some of that is offset by online consumption. As we discussed in our Q2 call, younger people are having less sex, plus we're seeing an increase in use of non-latex condoms. Innovation is always a catalyst to category growth. Our new XOXO condom, which is geared towards women, is going very well.","Finally, we closed the Waterpik acquisition in the quarter. We were attracted to Waterpik because it has a bright future as consumer awareness of the importance of gum health continues to grow.","Next up is Rick to give you some details on Q3 results and the outlook for the rest of the year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.49 per share compared to $0.47 in 2016, up 4% excluding a $0.03 tax benefit from reversal of a tax reserve related to a prior-year joint venture impairment charge. The $0.49 was better than our $0.46 outlook, largely due to some help from tax, better gross margin and lower SG&A. Reported revenues were up 11.2% to $968 million, organic sales were 3.2%. Weather-related hurricane disruptions negatively impacted organic growth by approximately 20 basis points for the quarter.","Now, let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic business organic sales increased 2.2% driven by higher volume; growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, cat litter and baking soda; BATISTE dry shampoo; and, OXICLEAN stain fighters. Volume growth was 7%, offset by negative price mix of 5%. In terms of negative price, this reflected higher promotional levels, NPD support, lower personal care versus household growth, all of which we expect to improve in Q4. And as Matt said, October is off to a good start.","International organic growth was up an impressive 6.2%, broad-based across the globe. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 7.5% due to higher volumes in the animal productivity business.","Turning to gross margin, our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 45.3%, a 10 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was a bit better than we originally expected, despite the impact of the hurricanes, largely due to continued productivity improvements and better margin on International and SPD.","The Q3 gross margin decline breaks out as follows. We had higher volumes and promotional levels in Q3; netted, that was a drag of 100 basis points, improvement of 100 basis points due to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, productivity programs helped by 30 basis points, and FX was a slight drag of 10 basis points. Finally, commodities were a 30 basis point drag on the quarter.","I know a lot has been said on resin and, while spot prices of ethylene-based derivatives like resin and surfactants increased between 10% and 20% in the quarter, our impact was, in part, mitigated by our hedging program.","Moving, now, to marketing, marketing as a percent of revenue was 11.6%. If we exclude Waterpik, we were up 60 basis points versus a year ago. Remember, in previous years, the big spend quarters were Q2 and Q4. This year we concentrated our spend in Q2 and Q3 to better support innovation. Our Q4 spending levels look a lot like Q3. SG&A as a percent of net sales was 13.2%, a 160 basis point increase, of which 100 basis points is attributed to acquisition transition and amortization costs. Base SG&A is up due to higher R&D and legal spending.","Now, to operating profit, the adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 20.5%, which reflects marketing shift and higher SG&A from recent acquisitions. Other expense was $11.7 million, primarily driven by $14.4 million of interest.","Next, the income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 28.7%, which includes a 400 basis point benefit due to the reversal of a joint venture tax reserve. Excluding that reserve reversal, the effective rate in the quarter approximates our full year adjusted rate of 33%.","Turning to cash, we generated approximately $424 million of net cash for the first nine months, $70 million decrease from the prior year, largely due to working capital. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of accounts receivable factoring, the higher deferred compensation payments and higher inventories. This was partially offset by higher cash earnings. Full year cash from Ops is expected to be approximately $650 million.","So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include strong share growth driven by growth in the Domestic business, continued expansion of our International Consumer business and strong growth in our SPD division.","Turning to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 2.5% as we ramp down MPD promotional support and our Personal Care business sequentially improves. The early read for October is category growth is stronger, promotional levels are down a bit and our Personal Care business is off to a good start.","We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.50 compared to $0.44 a year ago, or a 14% increase year-over-year. And turning to the full year, we're adjusting our expectations for organic sales growth to 2.5%. We continue to expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth, or $1.92 per share. And as a reminder, acquisitions are EPS neutral for the year. We expect approximately $605 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $45 million of CapEx for the full year. This represents in excess of 120% free cash flow conversion.","And finally, we all know that tax reform's a moving target. The company believes that the most meaningful aspect is a lower corporate tax rate. And as a reminder, over 80% of our business is based in the U.S. from a revenue perspective, but 90% of our profits come from the U.S.","So now, Matt and I will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Actually, this is Stephanie on for Bill. My question is actually just looking for a little bit more color on the international business; definitely, outperformed and exceeded our expectations despite the tough comp. So maybe if you could just give some color on kind of which brands are doing better, or is it \u2013 what you're seeing there? And then, obviously, your comment on expanding more in Asia, just color there would be helpful. Thanks so much.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. We said on prior calls that our \u2013 the three big brands that generally drive the international business are STERIMAR, BATISTE and \u2013 I forgot the third one. FEMFRESH, yeah. STERIMAR, BATISTE and FEMFRESH. In addition to that, in North America, ARM & HAMMER has been growing really well for us, ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, both in Canada and in Mexico.","You know, as far as the business goes, the business is extremely healthy and we've had broad-based growth across virtually all of our countries in the third quarter. As I said before, our long-term algorithm is for the international business to grow 6% annually, and we're confident that we can deliver that.","As far as my comments earlier about Asia, so Asia-Pacific is extremely attractive to us. It has a growing middle class. I mean, the countries we'd be most interested there would be Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand. And with a growing middle class using increasing consumption of personal care products, and our products are under-represented there, so we're looking at consolidating our resources in that area, making more investments in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","I'm sorry. I apologize if I missed it. Did you guys comment on the 50 basis points lower outlook on organic sales for the year? So, it was approximately 3% before; now, we're down to 2.5%. I know you had a little bit of hurt from the hurricane in the quarter, but fairly modest in the quarter, so even less \u2013 far less material for the year. Can you comment on that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. You're only the second question in, Kevin, so you didn't miss it. So, our categories in the first half of the year grew 1.5%. That's ticked down a bit in the third quarter; a little over 1% for our categories, so \u2013 and we expect the same for Q4, and I think that's reflected in our full year call, up 2.5%. The other piece of that is international.","International has had big growth for three quarters. They're going to be much lower in the fourth quarter, and that's \u2013 it can be somewhat lumpy in international, and one of the reasons for that is because of export. We have lots of different countries, so it doesn't always come in that evenly. It's no reflection of our long-term expectation of international, but international will be part of the story for the fourth quarter and why we'd be a little bit short.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","So, Matt, was there a little bit of timing just to clean that up? Was there a little bit of timing that helped international in the quarter, because you guys are running ahead, I guess, of where you had guided for the year in international?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, we came in at 6% \u2013 6% and change organic for the quarter for international. It's early \u2013 we had a big first quarter for international, so it's a little bit lumpy. So, it'll be our lowest quarter of the year, but it's just going to fall over into 2018.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And even on a stack basis in Q4, Kevin, we're still in the low-teens for the international business, so it's not like it's dropping off the face of the earth.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. No, no, no. Understood. Thanks, Rick. Two more quick ones for me. Waterpik, did you guys provide a growth rate in the quarter? I know you're guiding to 4%, but it's been growing 10%, historically, so I think a growth rate in the quarter would help. And then, related to that, what have you learned regarding the business post the close of the deal?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. We didn't get into that level of detail as far as the net sales growth in the quarter, but what I can say is \u2013 what we had said is it's going to grow above our evergreen target of 4%. The business did perform well in August and September. So, we think that this business is going to be a big part of our story going forward.","Some things we've learned, it's a very innovative culture; 20% of the business is online, which might be astonishing to you. It's sort of very sophisticated in how to sell online. I would think international is a big opportunity, because only $50 million of their business is international today. And of course, we have a $700 million business in international. So, we have a lot of leverage that we can help those guys grow their business.","So, it's \u2013 we're very happy with this acquisition. The integration is going very well. Integration is not dependent upon people as much as it is a focus on how we can leverage the Church & Dwight with the suppliers and, also, the networks that we have internationally to grow their business.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Matt. One more, if you guys could comment on the pricing environment; increasingly, discussion is coming up that input costs have sort of reemerged here, but the consumer environment's weak and you guys are even pointing to that with some slower category data. So, what's your expectation here with respect to pricing in Q4? And as we look out to next year, do you see inability to take pricing? Is that something that you would lead in some of your categories? So, any commentary there with respect to the ability to take pricing as input costs inflate here would be helpful. And that's it for me. Thanks guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, tapering pricing in this environment is very difficult. I mean, generally the only categories you're going to be taking price in is where you have a clear number one share, and even then, you need to have a story with respect to input costs. So, that would be, for example, in condoms for latex. So, I think price \u2013 pass-through of input costs is generally difficult. Typically, what you see is changing in quantity sizes, in ounces and units in a package, is how you're going to get price.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for letting me ask a question.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, there.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","You can always ask a question, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I can, but usually there's not always an audience to ask it to. So, I'm trying to understand gross margin a little bit better here, given the magnitude of pricing \u2013 negative price drag that rolled through the P&L, only 30 bps of cost inflationary pressure, I think I heard you say, Rick. Can you fill in the holes in terms of the rest of the gross margin bridge, while we wait for your 10-Q to come out and do it for us?","And high level, it's hard to get to where you're at without an assumption that there is maybe up to 200 basis points of mix benefit from acquisition that's kind of coming out at the SG&A line. So, A, is that true? If so, it sort of implies underlying base business gross margins are down pretty substantially. Are you still sort of on track? I guess, kind of where I'm getting to is are you still sort of on track to, on an underlying basis, getting the margin expansion you expected at both gross and EBIT? And sorry, long winded, multi-faceted question.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, lots of commas in there, Jason. But...","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, I know. Lots of pauses, commas.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","You know, I did go through the gross margin bridge in my prepared comments. I'll rehash it really quick for you, and then talk about the go forward. But we said net of higher volumes and leverage on that, plus promotional levels, was a drag of 100 basis points in the quarter; 100 basis points to the good was the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and productivity programs helped by 30 basis points. Currency was a drag of 10 basis points and commodities were a hurt of 30 basis points.","Now, on a go-forward basis, yeah, we are confident that gross margin is expanding. I think for the full year, the number's probably going to fall a little bit closer to the 20% than the 40% that our original outlook was. That's predominantly because of some of the resin costs, right. We do have a great hedging program, but some of that does impact us. We've had some mix headwinds from Personal Care versus Household.","But the good news is that in Q4, as you look at our trends of negative price mix over the past couple quarters, we talked about it last call, domestic business in Q2 was down 600 basis points in price mix; this quarter is down 490 basis points. We expect it to be closer to flat, maybe slightly negative, in the fourth quarter. Why? Because a lot of our lower couponing \u2013 we have lower couponing around our new products, like the new litter and unit dose are doing well, so the trial generating activities ramp down and some of our promotional levels are being lapped. So, we had negative price in the laundry category a year ago in Q4. And then, we have improved Personal Care performance, as well, expectations in Q4.","So, I would say the short answer is we expect the base business gross margin to continue to have momentum. We don't have any expectations for the base gross margin to be going backwards in any way. We continue to think that we have expansion there for next year, for sure.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And do you still expect 30 bps of EBIT margin expansion for the year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","It's kind of fuzzy, because we have three or four metrics that we talk about and go through, with and without Waterpik. I would tell you, including Waterpik, we do not because there is transition and implementation integration costs, but we're slightly positive ex Waterpik.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks guys. And I know you've kind of talked a little bit about what next year could look like. I know there's an EPS number out there when you did the Waterpik acquisition. I guess I really wanted to focus more on the organic sales. And I mean, good to hear that the promotional environment is coming down a little bit and Personal Care doing a little bit better, but can you \u2013 your commentary about category trends, 1%-ish fourth quarter. How are you starting to think about next year? Do you think that we could see outsized growth, again, from international? Do you think Consumer Domestic is \u2013 I guess, we're going to have a little bit more of the same promotional changes out there? I was just wondering if you could maybe tease a little bit in terms of how we should be thinking about next year's organic sales growth.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, as you know, Jason, we only give our outlook every February. So, we have no intention of giving a 2018 outlook today. What I can remind everybody of is that we have an evergreen target of 3% organic growth, annually, and that target is based on Domestic growth of 2%, International of 6%, and Specialty Products of 5%. And the Specialty Products of 5% is driven by the fact that, over the last couple years, we bought a couple of businesses, one was VI-COR, the other Agro BioSciences that got us into things other than dairy, so we're expecting a lot of growth from that business going forward.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Maybe if I could just extend it just into, maybe, the Personal Care, since I broached the topic. If you could talk about maybe some of the businesses where, I think, there's some new innovation coming out; just wondering how that's starting to play into consumption trends. If you think about oral or the condom category, obviously, BATISTE is doing well and I know you're saying Personal Care is sounding a little bit better in October, but maybe can you flesh that out a little bit more, which categories where the innovation is resonating, where maybe you're kind of matching promotions on maybe gummies; I'm not sure. Can you talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing, there, that gives you the confidence that Personal Care will be better in the fourth quarter and, hopefully, into next year?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, we're already seeing those trends in the fourth quarter. We're seeing that both vitamin consumption and condom consumption has improved from quarter-to-quarter. Now, we can \u2013 it's a little early with respect to answering your fourth quarter question when XOXO could be part of that story for condoms. And obviously, we had some new innovation on the vitamin side of the business.","BATISTE, of course, is in dry shampoo, has been a rocket ship for us. You might have probably heard on my comments that that category grew 33% year-over-year in the third quarter and, at the same time, we grew share tremendously and we are at 33% share. That's a category that's $140 million. And if it grows as fast as the UK and where the UK levels off, it will be a $300 million category. So it gives you a little bit of color on three categories in Personal Care.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I also wanted to ask about the FY 2018 outlook. And I know you're not looking to provide much detail for next year, but is that $209 million figure still the current thinking for next year or do we have to wait until next year to get an update on that number?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. You have to wait till next year to get an update. There is a \u2013 we tried to give some visibility when we had the Waterpik acquisition on how we were thinking about it. There's also lots of puts and takes that we'll talk about in February, and we're going to wait until then to do it, right. Resin keeps coming up, right. And lots of forecasts out there are calling a return to pre-hedge pricing, but you see a lot of our peers taking big call downs in their external outlook. We don't think that's going to happen, for example, but we're not going to go through that level of detail right now in November. We're going to wait until February to give you the full soup-to-nuts forecast that we typically do.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, just going back to the category growth rates, clearly, everyone's speculating on what's driving the slowdown out there. Do you guys have any additional perspectives on the slowdown that you saw in Q3? And then, if there's also \u2013 I was just curious if there's any way to quantify the type of uptick you're seeing in October from a category growth rate perspective? Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think the way to think about categories is you got to look at the volumes. So, the volumes are healthy in a lot of categories, so the real story is, when it comes to dollars, it's simply price; and, that's going to vary from category to category. And typically, it's much greater in household categories than it is in personal care, but as long as volumes stay healthy, I think that's a good barometer. So, I don't think that the price is something that is going to last permanently, but certainly it's something we're all dealing with now.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And to answer your other question, Rupesh, in Q3 Matt had said categories \u2013 our categories were around 1.1% growth in October, it was closer to 2%, as an example. Why? Because some of the promotional levels weren't as deep and they were lapping some higher promotional levels in Q4 year-ago.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Research (sic) [Consumer Edge Research]. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. First, I'd love you to comment on your club and e-commerce performance, given that Consumer Domestic tracked just a little bit better than our scan data would have indicated, and maybe what categories are driving that.","And a second question, related, on e-commerce, you had mentioned Waterpik's 20% online is a huge number. I think there's some obvious differences in that business that maybe make it more e-com friendly, but they \u2013 are there some learnings about Waterpik and some overlap where you can sell \u2013 you can learn from that and really advance e-com adoption at some of your other real high-value businesses that might overlap directly? Thanks very much.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Sure. This is Rick. I'll take the first one and Matt will talk about the Waterpik e-commerce. Your questions really shift into consumption. So, consumption was around 2.3% for the quarter. We have a 200 basis point drag from couponing, right. That doesn't get measured in Nielsen-type data and \u2013 similar to last quarter. And then, we have 200 basis points of positive from untracked channels, like online and club. We said in the release that our online business was up 70%, for example. That's really VMS, litter and TROJAN are the three \u2013 the big ones on online business. So, that's how we get to our shipment number or organic number of around 2.2% for Domestic.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. As far as your question on Waterpik, as I said before, it's a really impressive group of people that run that business. And when it comes to working online, it's early days, but what we've seen with respect to their development of web pages, the development of content for online, their social listening skills, the fact that they're already focused on Amazon, have sales on Amazon in Europe, they've been in it for \u2013 and more sophisticated than we've been for a number of years. So, we do think we can learn a lot from these guys. As far as is there any one specific category that would benefit, I mean, certainly it would be Personal Care more than Household because Personal Care lends itself more to online sales than Household. But it's a good question and we're very happy that these guys are now part of the family.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Just a few things...","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","...on the acquisition \u2013 Good morning. Thanks. On the acquisition contribution outlook, it just seems that the contribution was bigger than we had expected in the past quarter. So, if you could just give us a sense from a sales standpoint whether you see that Waterpik is coming in ahead of plan? And then, staying with Waterpik, what percent of the sales come from sort of electronic \u2013 the gadget part and what percent from the replacement part that's more the annuity business, and just what's the cycle there? Just a little deeper understanding would be really helpful.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Caroline. On the second one, in terms of the mix between units versus replacement, it's predominantly units, okay. It's a very small percentage that's replacements. That's not really as applicable at this time, right. Maybe that'll change one day in the future, but right now, it's largely just the replacement units and it's like a three-year replacement cycle, in general. So that's why innovation is so important, but that's also why category penetration is really the driver behind that business.","And then, your first question was on Waterpik and just the contribution. We're not going to give details of the businesses; we just don't. That's not our past practice. We haven't done that with any acquisition, whether it was Avid, Orajel, or OxiClean. I'm trying to be as clear as we can, but for EPS it's a neutral impact for the year and that's what we're going to stick with.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And then, just within the \u2013 you touched a little bit on the pricing environment and couponing, but are there any metrics you can put around what's going on in the vitamin business and just help us understand what the \u2013 how long this price war might continue?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, look, when it comes to vitamins, the category is healthy. There are a lot more competitors out there right now than when we first bought the business, so there's lots of options for consumers. The space has expanded, as far as when you go on shelf, and the space has expended largely for the existing pill brands that are now creating gummy products and expanding gummy products, like Nature Made, Nature's Bounty, Centrum. And there's a fair amount of brand loyalty when somebody switches from pills to capsules, and BOGOs are exacerbating that transition. So, we haven't been engaging in the BOGOs, which as I said, is affecting our ability to grow. We do have a new ad campaign right now to try to break through the noise in the gummy category and we do expect to be up in the fourth quarter. But yeah, it's concerning and something that we continue to watch, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Just lastly on that, is Amazon a major player there? Because one of our fears \u2013 and I think investors across the board are just wondering which categories is Amazon going to become a big private label player? And are you seeing them in any of your categories at this point?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. I mean, in gummy vitamins, we're the number one gummy on Amazon. In fact, our shares are super high in Amazon in comparison to what they are in bricks and mortar, so no worries there right now.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Reid - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. This is actually Sam Reid filling in for Bonnie. I actually had a bigger picture question. There's been a lot of talk about private label in many categories across the U.S., but a lot less talk in detergents, which I guess is a clear positive for you guys. Why do you think the detergent category is somewhat immune from private label penetration, at least here in the U.S.?","And then, separately, we know that private label detergent shares in places like Europe are significantly higher, at least in the tracked channels. Do you ever see this as a potential risk longer term to the U.S. market?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. The reason for that is private label today in laundry, and has been for a long, long time, is generally mid-tier. It's not a deep value. And if you look at the long-term trends, mid-tier has been the share donor to premium and to value detergent for a long, long time. And the reason you don't have a value in private label is because you already have deep value laundry detergent products on shelf, and so it's very difficult to make any money in deep value and come in as the opening price point below an extreme value laundry detergent. So, yeah, private label laundry detergent really is miniscule in the U.S. for that reason.","Sam Reid - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. No, that's really helpful. And then, I just had \u2013 I hate to belabor it, but another follow-up question on Waterpik; not about category growth here, though, but more on the showerhead business. What sorts of channel opportunities are you seeing here, specifically, now that you've owned this business for a little while? Just looking for some color there.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I wouldn't say it's a distribution game. It's really more innovation. So, the folks at Waterpik are experts in water jet technology. And just as they have the number one share and really own the water flosser category, they also have the number one share in replacement showerheads. So, there's \u2013 regulations typically affect the replacement showerhead business. In other words, the number of gallons per minute, today, generally around 2.0; that's going to go lower in the future. Question is, do you have the technology to deliver the same consumer experience that you did when you had a higher water flow? So, it's \u2013 to go back to your question, it's not a distribution game. It's really an innovation game.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I agree with Matt. It's not a distribution game. We are having some early success getting the Waterpik sales team in front of some other customers that we have a larger presence at. So, we're happy about that as part of integration as well.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'll give you an example of innovation. So, one of the new products is a Pet Wand. So, you know that more people have pets than children today, and that continues to grow. So, it's getting behind that particular trend. So, its translating their technology in the shower into a wand for washing your pets.","Sam Reid - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you, guys. That sounds awesome. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, and morning, everybody. Wanted to understand the rationale for the new share repurchase authorization. Anything you're trying to say regarding appetite for M&A just sort of broadly? And I guess, related to that, if larger assets and, like, large assets, sort of equal size assets became available, would you consider something sort of outside the box, like an RMT, to potentially merge with those?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'll take the buyback one and I'll let Matt comment on the RMT-type stuff. This is very in line with our history, right. We've got a $500 million repurchase authorization. We've done that pretty much every other year. It's just in line with our \u2013 really capital allocation model; doesn't mean we're going to go spend $500 million next year on share buyback. It just gives us the flexibility and authorization. So, yeah, historical levels that you would expect is what we probably would do in the future, in concert with paying down debt; and, number one priority, also, is going after the right acquisitions.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And to answer your second question, in my time with the company, we have looked at bigger transactions than the Waterpik transaction, which is our most recent one. And as far as other structures go, yeah, we're no strangers to visitors from the major banks coming in, proposing combinations with various companies in the past through other structures, which we'd always be open to to the extent that it is going to create shareholder value. But that's about all I could say.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And just lastly, wanted to go back to the commentary on the promo levels and the view that price volume would sort of normalize in a more traditional way going forward. I guess, how do you think about sort of the puts and takes to that? How quickly can you change the programs that you have in place, should some competitors decide to become more promotional, particularly as category volumes seem to be softening despite, obviously, what you said about the month of October?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. As far as how you react to a competitor move to take price down, typically it's IRCs, immediately redeemable coupons, those are things you can act on pretty quickly. As far as trade deals with the retailers, usually that's going to be six months out.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And we're not saying that we expect to see dramatic improvement in the level of promotion. We're saying that we're starting to lap some of the negative promotion from year ago, some of the couponing spends going down around new products because the trial period has passed, and our mix from Household and Personal Care is improving. So, while October's a good early read, it's also not our expectation that promotional levels go down significantly.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A portion for today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Matt Farrell for closing remarks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today and we'll see everybody in February with the 2018 outlook.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"4870":["Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  2, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","James R.

Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecast. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","James R. Craigie","Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start this call by providing you with my overview of our second quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and to discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you.","Let me start out by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the second quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures, the second quarter results reflect double-digit net sales growth of 13.1%, a triple-digit increase in gross margin versus year ago for the fourth consecutive quarter, a 17% increase in marketing spending versus year ago, with supported share growth on 7 of our 9 power brands, a 15% increase in operating income and a 20 basis point increase in operating margin versus year ago, a 9% increase in earnings per share versus year ago and a 17.8% increase in free cash flow versus year ago.","In addition, I'm pleased to report that the integration of our most recent acquisition, the Avid Health company, is off to a great start. Driven by double-digit sales growth and better-than-expected cost synergies. This strong start to 2013 makes us feel very confident at this point in time towards the achievement of our aggressive annual EPS growth target of a 14% increase versus year ago.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt to give you specific details on our second quarter results. Then, I'll return to provide some further insights on the key results of our key brands and provide additional details in my outlook for the year.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. Our second quarter EPS was $0.61 per share compared with $0.56 in 2012. That's an increase of 8.9% from a year ago. Reported revenues were up significantly, up 13.1% to $788 million. Organic sales for our global, domestic and international consumer businesses were up 3.2%. However, the Specialty Products organic sales was down 11.2% due to a large drop in demand from our dairy customers as a result of the colder-than-normal Q2 weather. Our all-in organic sales was up 1.8%, and of the 1.8%, approximately 2.7% is due to volume, with 90 basis points of unfavorable mix and price. Now, let's review the segments.","The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales increased 2.5%, primarily due to higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent, OxiClean laundry additives, TROJAN products and FIRST RESPONSE diagnostic kits. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent and Nair depilatories. Volume contributed approximately 4.6% of sales, partially offset by 2.1% unfavorable effect of product mix and price.","The International business increased organic growth by 6.3% in Q2 due to higher sales in Canada, the U.K. and Australia. We also had an easy comp year-over-year. This increase is driven by a higher volume of 2.8% and by 3.5% from product mix and price.","For our Specialty Products Division, the organic sales, as I said, decreased 11.2%. Volume represented 10.9% of the decrease.","Turning now to gross margin, our reported second quarter gross margin was 44.6%, a 110 basis points expansion from year ago. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the positive impact of our productivity programs. We have now had 4 consecutive quarters of 100 basis points or more of gross margin expansion, beginning with the third quarter of 2012 when we started up our Victorville, California plant. We've also brought laundry PODs in-house and we increased cat litter prices. Our 2013 improvement projects have also contributed to the 4-quarter gross margin streak.","Also Q2 was the third consecutive quarter of personal care growth. The gross margin expansion in Q2 was better than expected due to faster realization and larger-than-expected cost savings in the gummy vitamin business.","For the full year, we now expect gross margin to expand 50 to 75 basis points, which is up from our previously announced guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. And to the extent we expand our gross margin, we intend to spend a portion of the incremental gross profit back on the marketing line as we did in the second quarter.","Marketing spend for the second quarter was $103 million or 13.2% of revenues. That's a 50 basis points increase over the prior year spend rate,","[Audio Gap]","higher on a dollar spend rate. We continue to support new product launches and we grew our dollar share for 6 of our 8 power brands in the second quarter. And this is due to great execution by our sales and marketing teams. We expect full year marketing as a percentage of sales to be up about 30 basis points to approximately 12.5%.","SG&A year-over-year was higher by $14.6 million, primarily reflecting the inclusion of the Avid business. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.6% and that's up 40 basis points from year ago and that reflects higher stock option expense but it's partially offset by the leverage of the gummy vitamin business. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be approximately 12.9% of sales and that would be a 40 basis points improvement from the prior year, and this is a reflection of both our constant vigilance to control SG&A, as well as acquisition leverage.","Operating profit is next. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 17.8%, which was a 20 basis points increase over last year's 17.6%. Income from affiliates decreased year-over-year primarily due to a charge associated with one of our joint venture affiliates and other expense was higher year-over-year, primarily due to interest expense related to the Avid acquisition.","Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 34.5% compared to last year's 35.6%. We continue to expect the full year effect of tax rate to be approximately 35%.","With respect to cash, we generated $161 million of cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2013. That's a $28 million decrease over the prior year on a reported basis, but remember that we deferred a $36 million federal income tax payment from December 2012 to January 2013 as a result of Hurricane Sandy relief. So apples-to-apples, cash from operations is up $8 million year-to-date. We spent $20.1 million in CapEx, which is a $19.9 million decrease from a year ago, which, remember, included the 2012 construction of the company's Victorville, California plant. And we now expect full year CapEx to be approximately $80 million.","Regarding other destinations for cash, no shares were purchased in the second quarter. And we have approximately $220 million remaining in our authorization. We did pay down $50 million of debt in the second quarter and so far this year, we've paid down $100 million. I'm going to wrap it up now.","The second quarter highlights include 3.2% organic sales growth for the global Consumer business, 110 basis points of gross margin expansion, excellent progress from the gummy vitamin business and 8.9% EPS growth. And regarding the full year, we now expect full year organic sales to be approximately 2%. And if we take the midpoint of our previous 3% to 4% outlook, so let's call that 3.5%, there are 2 factors that bring it down to 2%.","First, 50 basis points is due to an expected full year sales decline for our Specialty Products Division as we do not expect to overcome weak Q2 results. And the remaining 100 basis points is from negative price mix, which reflects our decision to be price competitive and respond to increased discounting in a few of our categories. That 100 basis points also reflects weak category performance, including laundry, which is expected to partially offset our significant distribution gains.","With respect to gross margin full year, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we expect it to increase 50 to 75 basis points as we continue to gain the benefit of our productivity programs and capture synergies from our gummy vitamin business.","And on the operating margin line, we expect approximately 70 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2013, which is well balanced in that it includes gross margin expansion, a spend back into the marketing line, increased marketing, and SG&A leverage as well. For Q3 specifically, we expect 1% to 2% organic sales growth, which reflects many of the same factors I spoke about with respect to the full year.","Q3 gross margin will be comparable to the prior-year quarter. This is an improvement versus our previous thinking given the performance of our gummy vitamin business. And remember, we will be lapping some of the large benefits, which began in Q3 of 2012, and we will be absorbing the impact of more negative price mix. And Q3 will also be marked by an increase in marketing spend to support our key brands.","Finally, we expect 10.6% increase in third quarter earnings-per-share to $0.73 per share compared to $0.66 per share last year.","Back to you, Jim.","James R. Craigie","Thanks, Matt. I'll finish off our call today by adding a little color to the second quarter results Matt just took you through and my outlook at the year. As stated earlier, those of you who haven't heard me speak before know that I've been a long-term pessimist about business environment. The latest forecast of weak GDP growth, continuing high unemployment and weak same-store sales by major retailers provides little hope for significant near-term improvement in the U.S. economy. In fact, of the 14 categories that Church & Dwight operates in, 5 incurred lower category dollar sales in the second quarter versus the prior year and 5 more had category growth of less than 2% versus the prior year.","Now, all consumer packages companies are fighting these headwinds. As I told you many times before, I believe no other consumer packages company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. There are 7 key factors that support that statement. First, we have the most unique product portfolio within the CPG industry. It consists of both premium and value brands. This puts us in a position to thrive in any type of economy as exemplified by our ability to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the prior 12 consecutive years.","In particular, our value brands representing about 40% of our revenue base have experienced strong growth in the recessionary economy, as consumers are generally making smart choices by switching to and staying with our high-quality, but lower-priced brands. A great example of this is our value-based laundry detergent business, which consists of 2 brands, ARM & HAMMER and XTRA. These brands sell for 1\/2 to 2\/3 less than the premium-priced brands and deliver exceptional cleaning performance. Consumers love our value detergent brands as proven by the fact that more U.S. households buy a value brand than premium or mid-priced laundry detergent brands. The great value delivered by our 2 value brands has resulted in steady share growth.","In the second quarter, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a record quarterly share of 9.6%, which was its 14th consecutive quarter share growth versus year ago and enabled us to pass the all brand to become the #3 brand in America. ARM & HAMMER was 1 of only 2 major brands to deliver share growth in both the second quarter and the latest 52 weeks. And I just learned yesterday that ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent hit an all-time record monthly share of 10.1% in the month of July.","Our XTRA brand also achieved share growth in the second quarter. It is now the #2 liquid laundry detergent brand on a wash load basis, representing 1 out of 7 wash loads in America. The strong consistent share growth of both of these brands has enabled Church & Dwight to increase its liquid laundry detergent market share by 50% over the past 5 years and become the #2 laundry detergent company in America.","The second factor, which is a key driver of Church & Dwight's success is that we have a proven record of building share on our power brands. We have over 80 brands, but 8 of these brands are our historic power brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profits. We have now added a 9th power brand with the acquisition of the Avid gummy vitamin business. From 2008 through 2012, we grew market share on each of the 8 historic power brands in almost 75% of the","quarters. In the second quarter of this year, we grew market share on 6 of our 8 historic power brands and 7 of the 9 power brands including Avid.","Three key factors drove these excellent share results. First, we have effectively reinvested some of the increased profits from the strong growth of our value brands to increase marketing support on our power brands. The second quarter of 2013, we increased our marketing score by over $15 million versus year ago, which represented a 50-basis-point increase. The other factor driving the growth of our power brands is our robust pipeline of new products.","Over the past 4 years, new products delivered about 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We have launched innovative new products in almost every key category this year. A sample of these new products includes ARM & HAMMER's new Ultra Power laundry detergent, which provides consumers with a more concentrated liquid laundry detergent in a smaller bottle, which is easier to handle, more environmentally friendly and enables dosage control for lightly soiled to heavily soiled wash loads. This new product is driving incremental sales for the brand, and as stated earlier, enabling the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent business to achieve its 14th consecutive quarter of share growth.","Other new products that have been launched in 2013 or late 2012 include a new line of sexual lubricants under the TROJAN brand name; a new spa clay line of products under the Nair brand; a new toothbrush under the ARM & HAMMER TOOTH TUNES brand, which plays music by the One Direction boys band; a new single-dose cold sore treatment under the Orajel brand; and a new dishwashing booster product under the OxiClean brand. More detailed information on all of these innovative new products is on Church & Dwight's website.","Part of the increased marketing spending behind these innovative new products is increased sampling. We will drive awareness and trial on our new TROJAN lubricant line by providing samples in 4 million boxes of TROJAN condoms. And to drive awareness and trial of our great tasty line of gummy vitamins, we'll increase in-store sampling by over 60% versus last year. In addition to the increased marketing spend in innovative new products, the other key driver of share growth in our power brands is increased distribution.","As a result of the consistent strong share growth in our power brands over the past 5 years, the Church & Dwight sales force has worked closely with our retail partners to increase the shelf space of our brands, to meet both the increased consumer demand and minimize out of stocks. The distribution gains achieved in 2013 across all brands were the greatest in my 9-year tenure as CEO. The combined effect of these innovative new products, increased marketing spending and increased distribution, delivered organic growth on Church & Dwight's Global Consumer business of 3.2% in the second quarter, despite the weak economy and the increased competitive spending. These share gains in 7 of our 9 power brands puts us in a position to achieve stronger organic growth in 2014 behind a strong pipeline of innovative new products in our core business, continued strong growth of the new gummy vitamin business and an improvement in the sales of our cyclical Specialty Products business.","Let me just wrap up on this point about my company's ability to grow our power brands with the following Q2 share highlights on our other power brands. OxiClean powder laundry additive grew its category leading share by 1.5 points to 42.4% and is now over 2X larger than its nearest competitor. Spinbrush is the #1 battery-powered toothbrush across all classes of trade and is #1 for both kids and adults. In fact, the Spinbrush kids line has doubled its share since 2009 and now represents 5 of the top 10 selling SKUs, including 2 of the hot new TOOTH TUNES products.","TROJAN grew its share to 76.2% of the U.S. condom business, driven by having all 10 of the top 10 selling retail SKUs. The new TROJAN lubricant line, which was launched in the second quarter, has already achieved a 5.5% share for the quarter and a 7% share in the month of June as it continues to gain distribution. FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits achieved a record quarterly share 31.3%, up 2.5 points versus year ago and has been the #1 selling pregnancy test kit for 34 consecutive quarters.","Nair achieved share gains in the second quarter of 0.7 percentage points to 31.7% to maintain its leadership position for the 34th consecutive quarter.","And finally, our new Avid acquisition had a terrific second quarter of 2013. Li'l Critters, our kids vitamin brand, achieved its highest dollar share ever based on 15.8% consumption growth. And Vitafusion, our adult vitamin brand grew its share driven by a 55% consumption growth. Vitafusion is the #1 adult gummy vitamin for the past 8 quarters and is the fastest-growing adult vitamin brand for the past 52 weeks.","Now, that's a pretty impressive scorecard for Q2 share results. Let me run quickly to the 5 other key drivers of Church & Dwight's success. Number three is that we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands as evidenced by our ferocious defense of OxiClean when a large competitor entered the category several years ago. OxiClean not only fully deflected that attack, but now has strengthened its leadership position to the record share levels achieved in the second quarter, to be larger than the combined share of the #2, #3 and #4 competitors in the laundry additive category.","The number four factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our International business. While our International business represents only about 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high-single digit sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the last 5 years. As Matt mentioned earlier, this strong growth continued in the second quarter, with 6.3% organic growth, driven by excellent results in Canada, the U.K. and Australia. The International organic growth would have been even stronger except for lower sales of Nair, which was impacted by the cooler than expected weather in Q2.","Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margins through cost optimization programs, supply chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher-margin new products. Driving improved gross margin is deeply ingrained in Church & Dwight's organization. We not only talk-the-talk, but we walk-the-walk. 25% of every Church & Dwight employees' annual bonus is based on achieving our gross margin improvement target. I'm not aware of any other CPG company that explicitly has gross margin targets in their employee bonus programs. This deeply ingrained and incentivized focus on gross margin has enabled Church & Dwight to expand gross margins by 1,450 basis points over the past 11 years.","Headwinds from higher commodity costs stalled our gross margin improvement in 2010 and '11, but we were able to overcome these headwinds by the middle of 2012 to deliver 2 consecutive quarters of 100 plus basis point gain and gross margin versus year ago in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. This momentum continued in the first half of 2013 with 110 basis points increases in gross margin versus year ago in both the first and second quarters. And as Matt and I mentioned earlier, the cost synergies from the integration of the gummy vitamin acquisition are exceeding expectation, so we expect to deliver gross margin results for the rest of 2013 that exceeded our prior expectations.","The sixth factor behind our continued success is our ability to tightly manage overhead costs. As Matt mentioned earlier, we expect to reduce SG&A as a percent of our net sales to decline again this year. This will enable Church & Dwight to continue to have the highest revenue per employee of any major CPG company.","And finally, factor number seven is our strong record on free cash flow. Like gross margin, free cash flow is another one of the company's key components in our annual bonus program for all employees. As a result of having every employee focused on and incentivized to deliver higher free cash flow, we have quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. And over the past 5 years, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income was 120%, which was best-in-class in the CPG industry.","As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow in second quarter. This cash flow and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain, including construction of more efficient new plants and acquisition of leading brands. All of these factors give me great confidence of our ability to deliver our aggressive 2013 EPS targets of $2.79, which is an increase of 14% over 2012 adjusted EPS. We believe we can deliver this aggressive EPS target despite continued expected headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures. Our confidence to deliver this aggressive EPS target is based on 2 key factors.","First, we believe we can continue to deliver the market share gains on our power brands. These share gains are expected to result from our innovative new products, increased marketing spending and significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands. Second, we now believe we can deliver gross margin expansion of approximately 50 to 75 basis points on our total business in 2013, including the new gummy vitamin acquisition. The higher projected gross margin will enable us to be price-competitive and increase marketing spending versus year ago on our power brands in the back half of 2013 to deliver the share gains.","Unfortunately, these share gains did not fully offset the weaker-than-expected category trends and lower-than-expected sales of our Specialty Products business in the back half of this year. So we're now projecting organic sales growth of 2% for the full year. While this outlook on organic growth is a bit lower than our initial goal of 3% to 4%, the share gains will put us in position to return to higher organic growth levels in 2014, behind a great pipeline of innovative new products in our global Consumer business, continued strong growth of our gummy vitamin business and expected improvement in the sales of our cyclical Specialty Products business.","In conclusion, 2013 is shaping up to be another challenging year. But when things get tough, you should place your bets on the company with a product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and a management team that has a track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio and drive cost savings to deliver consistently strong EPS growth. 2013 will be our 13th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth, and we believe we can continue to deliver double-digit EPS growth going forward.","This ends our presentation. I now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I, will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just doing the math on Avid and it looks like if you kind of run rate it, it's up like 30% since your acquisition. So when you kind of put it into the base, can you just talk about -- and the Nielsen Data, by the way, sort of corresponds to that, because if you look at your vitamin sales growth, it's like 30% every month. Kind of what's driving that? And do you think those trends can continue?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Bill, what's driving that is we've gotten significant distribution gains out in the marketplace through a great sales force execution and as I told you, we're doing 60% more sampling than past years. So we're doing a great job in driving the distribution and sales of the brand.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","The other thing, Bill, is the -- what you're looking at, the Nielsen Data, is an all-outlet, right? So there are obviously unmeasured channels in there as well that affect what the number is for us year-over-year. We did say double-digit growth going into the year, but of course, we didn't go any -- define that any more clearly than that. And if you want some color on the Avid acquisition, we did want to let you know that it's performing better. We're not going to be calling line items out with respect to the brand P&L. We did say that it was going to be a double digit. We are growing share. The gross profit is higher than we expected but our R&D spend is significantly higher than when it was a private company. And as far as the synergies go, you may recall, we called synergies of about $15 million. We said $9 million of that was going to be this year and $6 million next year. It's going to be more than $9 million. We're not going to be updating the number quarterly. We're just -- we're in a really good shape with respect to Avid.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What are the unscanned channels that wouldn't be in Avid [indiscernible] except for Costco? That's sort of like the AO [ph], whatever they call it. Like, what's on the scan?","James R. Craigie","Largely the club stores, Bill.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you.","James R. Craigie","But remember, when we bought this business, the club store channel was about 40% of the total business.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, I didn't know that. And then, sorry to keep going on in the Avid thing, but I think -- is there Santa Cruz, I guess is the big competitor, the only other competitor in gummy, and I think it just got sold to another private equity party. Does that impact the competitive dynamic at all?","James R. Craigie","No, we don't think so.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of your organic growth gains [ph], I know the retailers kind of changed their planograms mid-way through the year. Were there any distribution losses that are going to drive some of the shortfall on the organic growth relative to the previous expectations?","James R. Craigie","No, there was nothing significant, Bill.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then what are the categories that are becoming much more price competitive? Because I know you didn't really drill down to that level in your prepared comments.","James R. Craigie","Yes, Bill, we've got to be careful what we say about price lift. Generally, there's only -- we said there's only a few categories and generally it's just in laundry and cat litter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you give us some clarity on how much worse the promotional environment has gotten in the laundry and cat litter category? And then also, are you expecting a volume payback from these pricing adjustments because based on the lower organic sales growth guidance, it doesn't sound like you're expecting much of a volume boost?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Dara, it's a good question, but it's hard to quantify. And really, again, I can't go into details on, in fact, pricing that much. There were issues out there, we decided to get price competitive. Again, because of our focus on gross margin. The great news was that we were able to get price competitive and increase our marketing spending. So we feel fully we have addressed the issues out there and things should get better, continue to drive good share gains for us, which we want going into 2014.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And are you expecting to get a volume payback from these actions or is it more just to reestablish price competitiveness versus their competitive set?","James R. Craigie","Well, that's built in to our forecast. Let me just tell you, we always want to be straight with you guys. We have these issues looking forward. We don't want to be a falling knife in the sense of making a little adjustment then another adjustment, another adjustment. We wanted to reset the year on organic side and, if anything, we're being conservative. But we'll see. But it's just a case of -- we felt it's appropriate and we gave it a specific call instead of a nebulous, lower end of this or that. So we gave it a 2%. But we think that's the bottom and hopefully, things could be better than that.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the category weakness you referenced, is that just tied to the promotional environment and is that pricing related or do you think it's also tied to underlying consumer demand in terms of the U.S. consumer being weak?","James R. Craigie","I don't think -- there's nothing worse in the consumer environment. It's still weak. You know, we had issues in the laundry category for some new products launched a year ago. The good news on that is that the laundry category is starting to head back up. It bottomed out at about a negative 4.3% in the first quarter of this year, second quarter is minus 2.6% and we expect it to get better than that over the rest of this year and hopefully break into the black in 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I know you haven't given guidance for 2014 other than saying that you hope to return to the 3% to 4% organic sales growth. Can you say something about whether you can again turn in another double-digit EPS growth rate as you've done for many years? We won't have accretion from the Avid acquisition and commodity costs look like they might be a little less benign. So what are things that could help you retain that double-digit EPS growth in 2014?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Alice, that's always our goal. We've done it for 13 years when this year finishes and I have every desire to keep that going forward a goal. The things that will help us do that is we have a great pipeline of new products for next year. We can't give any details right now but I just love what I see in the new products pipeline. We are going to be increasing marketing spending because we see gross margins being improved next year. And then we expect some bounce backs. The weather, we wouldn't expect to be as bad as this year, which will help both our Specialty Products Division and our Nair business. I told you just a moment earlier, you heard I expect improvement in the laundry category, which will also help. It's already coming back. That will all lead to stronger organic growth along with the gross margin improvement. And we always tighten our belts in SG&A and we believe that formula, we won't give you the details yet. We don't have them yet, exact numbers for every one of the P&L items. But we believe that combination will, once again, for the 14th year, lead to double-digit EPS growth.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And you just said that the detergent category is getting a little better and yet you are projecting the same 1% to 2% organic sales growth in the third quarter. It's the second quarter. Will we still see Domestic Consumer up 2.5% with strong volume and negative price? And why wouldn't Domestic Consumer be better in the third quarter than the second quarter given that detergents will be better as a category?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Alice, we don't call the organic growth by each of the 3 segments. We have a number out there of 1% to 2%, and that's an all-in number, including Domestic, International and Specialty Products.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I mean, will Specialty maybe get worse and Consumer better versus the third quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","No, no, the weather has gotten a little hotter. If you notice it was pretty hot July, so I don't expect the SPD to be the same drag in Q3 as it is in Q2.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","We're to say, we're taking a very conservative approach for the back half of the year, Alice. We feel it's appropriate and, like I said, that we hope it's a better than we're being called, but we're going to -- we decided to call kind of a floor on it and then see what happens.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And in just sticking with detergents, were your detergent sales overall, putting XTRA and ARM & HAMMER and powder and liquid altogether, were they up in line in the second quarter with that 2.5% for Domestic Consumer?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","I'm trying to look at numbers --","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Or faster or slower or -- I mean, really what matters is a detergents altogether, right?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. I don't have a number off the top of my head here, Alice. Our overall shares on laundry detergent, all channels, including non-measured channels, was up. What you don\u2019t see is we had some very good results in the club store channel. Brands like ARM & HAMMER Liquid was up over 10% in the second quarter if you count all channels. So I don't have it in front of me the total laundry detergent business. So we're -- I can tell you, overall, we're performing better than anyone else in the category. It's just the category is real tough. When the category is down several percent, it's a little bit of a drag. It's hard to overcome.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Is ARM & HAMMER Liquid overall was up over 10% in value terms in the second quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So it sounds like you have approximately 2% to 3% organic sales growth embedded in your guidance in the fourth quarter. And so I was kind of wondering what gives you confidence in seeing acceleration there. New products, I guess, probably less of a drag from Specialty Products. Maybe 2 months of Avid in your organic sales. Are those the things benefiting you? Or is there something I'm missing there?","James R. Craigie","No, Joe, the biggest factor is Avid goes organic in the fourth quarter.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough.","James R. Craigie","We're being conservative on the rest.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. Why was XTRA Liquid Laundry Detergent lower in the second quarter? I'm assuming maybe some competitive action on pricing there? But at the low price point, I would think you'd see a benefit from the consumer pullback. And then you've got the sell-on of some new fragrances and stuff like that, so just kind of curious on XTRA.","James R. Craigie","There was just a lot -- but not a lot. There was some very aggressive competitive activity in there that impacted XTRA.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on gross margin, it sounds like based upon your guidance, probably slightly lower year-over-year in the second half. What are kind of some of the puts and takes in gross margin there? I mean, is Victorville done? I mean -- or can we see some more incremental benefit from that? And has all laundry detergent production on the West Coast moved into Victorville? Or is there still some more to come there?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, let's do them in reverse order. So with respect to Victorville, Victorville does make a lion's share of not only the laundry, but also the cat litter that goes out to the West Coast, but not exclusively. With respect to the benefit of it, to the extent that, that business grows, we get a significant leverage on variable margin. We've been running the plant for a year. We continue to get better in reducing our product costs and improving our conversion rates. So I would say that is certainly going to help us not only this year, but going forward. But back to your question about the fourth quarter. In the second half, if you look at the first half, we've got 110 basis points in Q1 and Q2. So that's averaging about 55 basis points. For a full year basis, if we were flat in the second half. So we do think that in the second half, we are going to be up still a little bit more. I think Q2 -- or Q3, I mentioned earlier, would be flat, about the same as last year, which was 45.2% gross margin. But you're right about the fourth quarter. And as you move into the year, yes, you're selling more of your newer products. We try to launch new products at higher-than-average gross margins. And we continue to get more and more benefits from the gummy vitamin business, so that's higher than expected and that's -- and Q4 is a big quarter for vitamins. Historically, it's the biggest quarter of the year. So there are a number of things that are influencing the gross margin year-over-year growth. So I would say flattish in Q3 and then up a little bit in Q4.","James R. Craigie","Yes, Joe, don't forget, we had some major productivity programs kick in, in Q3 of year ago. Being the new Victorville plant, we brought the unit dose product in-house. We had a price freeze on cat litter. So we benefited for the 4 quarters that followed that quarter all the way through Q2 of this year. Now, we'll start lapping that. So that's why we still have productivity programs going on. Like Matt said, they'll still drive, in the back half, some improvement versus year ago back half, but we're now lapping beyond those major programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up a little bit actually on the guidance for the rest of the year and especially as you talked to the fourth quarter. I mean, if Avid is running plus 20%, 30%, it's going to add a couple of points to your organic growth in the fourth quarter by itself. So are you expecting the business to not -- the core business not to really improve from current levels through the whole back half of the year?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Bill, we're not going to comment on the breakout between Domestic, International and SPD. You're right that gummy business is a big driver in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we do expect growth from the Consumer business in both Q3 and Q4, but not as much as we had expected historically.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then on that same line, when I'm looking at the margins, with Avid growing faster than expected, are we getting close to having Avid at corporate gross margins or are we -- I mean, can we exceed that by the end of this year? Because you would seem to need to have some improvement by the fourth quarter, which is weighted towards vitamins.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, it would be really unusual for us to announce to retailers and competitors what our gross margin is for that or any other business, frankly. You remember, we bought a business at a 38% trailing gross margin and we've said that we're ahead of schedule, but we're not -- I don't expect today or in the future to call out gross margin by quarter. But I can say that we are very happy with where we are today.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the detergent side, you talked about price competition. But you look at the leader, they're way much higher than you on price. So are you seeing new competition from some of the flankers from -- that are priced more in and around all -- I mean, ARM & HAMMER and XTRA?","James R. Craigie","No, I really don't want to get into that. I don't want to name names. There's 4 key competitors in the category. It's always a very competitive category. And I'll just tell you, you know in the past, we're very good at it, that why our share has grown consistently, and we do what we have to do to continue to drive share growth in the category.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","All right. Last one for me, animal husbandry. Is this just people drinking less milk because of the weather or was something with the cows not getting enough pasture or anything I'm missing?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Animal husbandry? That's a new one.","James R. Craigie","Yes, actually, this will be the Discovery Channel portion of the earnings call. So the product that we make actually replaces electrolytes in cows. So sodium, potassium, et cetera. When the weather is really, really hot, what happens is cows start making milk. So by replacing that, they start producing milk. And when it's cold, there's no need for a number of our products. That's as simple as that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about restructuring. Given heightened competition domestically, I don't -- it doesn't sound like that's going to end anytime soon. So is there a need to do something a little bit more drastic in terms of cost cutting, more restructuring in order to fund the incremental promotion, incremental activity that needs to be done to defend your share within your categories?","James R. Craigie","Olivia, you said more restructuring. We don\u2019t need -- we've never had restructure, we're not going to restructure. We started small, we're going to stay small and we have highest revenue per employee in the industry. We always look for across the line how to keep our overheads tight and through cost-saving programs and leveraging acquisitions, we've been able to steadily take our SG&A and some of that revenue down over year. So we don't have the problem other guys do because we're already very low on overheads but amazingly find ways to keep taking it lower. But not through major restructuring programs.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then longer-term, where do you think that advertising goes over a longer term? I mean, if we're at sort of the 12.5-ish percent this year, does it go back up to where it has been in the past or is longer-term 12.5% still the right number?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, we've said in the past that 12% to 13% is the sweet spot for our marketing as a percentage of sales. And at that, a far more important measure is tracking your share of voice versus your share market. So what you're spending is always in relation to your competitors. So we follow that very closely and we're typically over indexed, meaning that our share of voice is significantly higher than our share of market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to start with Avid, I guess. In the past you've talked about cost savings. This year, I think of about $9 million, and then $15 million total. Obviously, it seems like things are going better than you expected there. So could you just update us on what your expectations are on the cost savings side for this year and then for next year as well?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. So really short answer, Joe. No. Well no, we -- you're right, we said $15 million, we said $9 million this year and $6 million next year. And of the $9 million this year was split, a 50-50 between COGS and SG&A. And next year was -- that $6 million next year was all SG&A. And what I said earlier is that we're ahead of schedule. This year is going to be more than $9 million and the total is going to be more than $15 million.","James R. Craigie","But it's very much like all the other acquisitions we've done in the past. Typically when we acquire a business, we identify cost synergies. We generally base the acquisition on the cost synergies. So we always hit them. And the goal is to exceed them.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And then secondly, Matt, you mentioned earlier that there was a charge at one of your affiliates. What is the size of that charge?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","That's $0.01.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, in terms of your laundry distribution, obviously, you talked about gaining a lot of distribution. Mostly this quarter, I thought, so I was a little bit surprised at the slowdown in household growth, but obviously, you talked about pricing there, et cetera. Have you guys maintained most of that shelf space gains? Are you expecting anything incremental in the back half?","James R. Craigie","Well, absolutely, no. We gained them, Joe, starting in Q2 and we certainly have maintained them since then. It's way too early to have any reversal of that. But we don't expect it. Everything we've gained has proven to be gold for us and the retailers. So everything is good so far.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Anything incremental on the back half?","James R. Craigie","Only if we were to launch a new product or 2, and sometimes we do that in the back half. But most of it is on the front half of the year, but there may be one at the back half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leigh Ferst of Wellington Shields.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","There were a lot of questions about vita already, but I just was wondering also about next year. It seems like it could be a significant portion of your organic outlook -- or organic growth with outlook with it and the base. And I realize it's early, but can you comment on that with respect to the vitamins versus the rest of the core business?","James R. Craigie","Leigh, it's because of the distribution gains that we've been picking up over the course of this year and we expect more in the back half of this year, I would just tell you, top line, to expect continued double-digit revenue growth on the vitamin business in 2014.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","But as a portion of your organic growth outlook for next year? It seems like it's a major portion still like it would be on the fourth quarter?","James R. Craigie","Well, no. Well, keep in mind that the vitamin business is only about less than 10% of our total revenues. So put that in perspective with that kind of growth.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess I should know this, but are you going to count it in your premium value mix, which piece is it in?","James R. Craigie","Vitamins will be premium.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And with respect to your cost-cutting, I mean you've done a great job for a long time and you sound confident that it can continue, but at what point do you feel like you're cutting too close to the bone? How do you look at that over a long-term perspective?","James R. Craigie","No, we were not anywhere near the bone. We're very lean and mean, but honestly, my team, as I told you before, it's 25% of their bonus every year and they're incented to keep finding ways to deliver gross margin improvement. And then when it's that much in the culture and in the pocketbook, trust me, they keep finding ways through efficiencies from efforts within the plants, the product lines. They're putting up new products with higher gross margins. We'll be doing things again next year in some of our plants to make them more efficient in that, product mix, trade spending, all that. We -- we're all over that every day. Again, my teams have the incentive through their bonuses in that to stay on top. It's just part of our culture. It's an incredible thing here at Church & Dwight and it's shown up this year. And I told you before, we fought off the headwinds and higher commodities in prior years better than anybody else and we came out of it strong now with 4 straight quarters of 100 basis points or more growth. And so I expect gross margin improvement to be no problem and continuing to improve in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy is CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","A couple of things, just looking at Avid, you talked about increased R&D. Can you elaborate on how this business might be different in an R&D -- from an R&D perspective? Was it simply there wasn't much done before and you're taking it to sort of normal levels? And a follow-on to that, do you see a lot of opportunity to expand beyond the existing products that you offer for Avid?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Caroline, this is Matt. So, yes, you're right in that this was a privately-owned business before and obviously, the capabilities that we have from an R&D perspective are far more expansive than what they had available to them. And we obviously have grand plans for this business, so we're immediately getting after ideas we have to expand the business. So it is significant -- we're spending significantly higher than what they would have spent in the past.","James R. Craigie","I would tell you too, sorry to pipe in. While we're the #1 gummy vitamin business, we're only 3% of the total vitamin category. So, to us, there's still tremendous upside in this business and part of that is growing the distribution base, part of that is putting more marketing spending behind the company. But part of that is also expanding the product line. It's wider than you may think right now. It's quite an expensive product line. But we see bigger opportunities in the future and for competitive reasons, I won't go into what. But we love the vitamin category. It's one of the fastest-growing categories in the world. It's been that way for a long time. And now we have what we think is a competitive advantage in that category with the gummy business and we're just, as Matt said, putting lots of R&D spending behind it to make sure we can capture all that growth.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. So we could probably expect a number of new products over the next 2 to 3 years?","James R. Craigie","The next 20 to 30 years.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, but short term, as well?","James R. Craigie","Absolutely.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you have a couple of your focus brands that aren't doing as well? I believe Nair was one of them. What do you see happening on those couple of underperformers and what do you imagine you can do to change that?","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes. Well Nair -- Nair as I said, Nair is the good news was it grew its share. The bad news was the weather really hurt that business this year. The category was down over 10% in the second quarter. So that was just totally driven by bad weather. And Nair is actually a bigger business for us outside the United States than it is in the U.S. and it's the foreign markets also had weather. So Nair isn't totally due to weather problems. The other categories are that there were some competitive things going on and we'll be addressing that with new products and marketing spending. But again, the overall story is 7 out of our 9 power brands grew share. So we feel pretty happy our new products are working and only a few had minor problems. On net -- like I said, Nair actually grew its share, but the category was really hurt by the weather. So next year, I expect a total rebound on Nair to help us.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And dare I ask, but you did venture into some interesting line extensions with electronics. And it's not a core business, sort of electronic expertise, and I'm just wondering how that's doing.","James R. Craigie","I'm sure you're talking about the Spinbrush business? No, just seriously --","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","No, I'm not. Yes.","James R. Craigie","That business is doing fine. It's a small business. We're getting generally about double-digit growth on that. But it's a very, very, very small base. And I'll be honest, the biggest issue we have there is getting more retail distribution on that product line. We're working on it over time, but it's a little harder given the sensitivity of that business than anything else we have. Everything else, retailers have no problem with, so we're having a little bit of some retailer resistance on that.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then on the big product, laundry category, you've been vocal that you think PODs have not -- are not a good thing for the category. Can you update us on your thinking? I'm also very clear in the P&G conference call yesterday and the way they've structured their management reporting, that the U.S. is an enormous focus for them. So any update on your thinking on laundry category?","James R. Craigie","Yes. I mean, the laundry category was a steadily growing category until PODs was introduced and it was introduced last Q2 and the category shrank 0.2%. In Q3, the category shrank 1.3%. In Q4, the category shrank 3.2%. And in Q4 it shrank 4.3%. Now, that's 4 quarters. We're coming out of it. The category only shrank 2.6% in Q2 of this year and we think in the back half of the year, it'll get better versus those numbers as we lap the PODs. So I think it definitely had an impact. It wasn't the only thing going on in the category but it definitely had an impact. But I think the brunt of that impact is behind us and I'm optimistic that by 2014, the laundry category will get back into a positive growth mode, which will be wonderful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, just, sorry, on laundry again, I just was curious how the ARM & HAMMER unit dose is doing and if, when you guys talk about powder laundry, if that includes unit dose or not? Because I think in Nielsen, it does as they categorize it in powder.","James R. Craigie","It's doing okay, Lauren. We've got a little bit less than our fair share but still a healthy mid-single digit share number on that and we're doing fine. We don't look at it within powder. We kind of look at it as a separate category in [indiscernible]. I mean, keep in mind too, for us good news; for maybe somebody else, not good news. The unit dose or you may call it POD category is still -- it level off at 8% of total laundry. It was 8% last Q4, it's 8% in Q1 of this year, it's 8% in Q2. So we're happy that, that's a leveling off and we're fine with our share in the category.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So the powder laundry decline is still a separate conversation from unit dose performance.","James R. Craigie","Right, right. And keep in mind, I mean, liquid is still 77%, 78% of laundry. That's where your focus should be. Powder is about 15% of laundry and PODs is only 8%. So that's our focus -- that's why we put our focus more this year on launching the Ultra Power, new ultra-concentrated form of liquid, because we want to help spur the 77%, 78% of the category rather than worrying about a new small category. We're players in the PODs category but our focus is more on liquid.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. Has there been any trade-off on distribution, so that new distribution for Ultra is replacing unit dose -- your unit dose products?","James R. Craigie","No. Oh, no, absolutely not. We only -- we told the retailers, we would only give them the Ultra Power if they put it in incrementally, and they all did. The product is doing fantastic. It represents over half of our share gains on ARM & HAMMER Liquid this year. So it's coming in very incremental and the results are very positive. I would just say on concentration, I want to talk about for a second -- the next round of concentration. I can't give you a timeframe, but it is an absolute winner for the category. It's been historically proven in this category, back several years. It grew the category mid- to high-single digits. It's being proven again right now in the bleach category as you probably heard in the Clorox call yesterday. There's mid- to high-single digits category growth. So when you talk about a product that's good for the category, good for the environment, good for retailers, good for everybody, and the consumers have embraced it, it's a winner. And I think some time in the near future here, you'll hopefully see the whole laundry -- liquid laundry category go through another round of compaction, which will be great for all players.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just on the International business, was the price mix [indiscernible] was a pretty big jump, was that more mix or more price?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Was more mix, actually. And remember, we had a goofy comparison year-over-year where we were down last year. So we had an easy comp.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So going forward, we should -- there isn't necessarily an incremental pricing element that we should be thinking about modeling for International?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","It's hard to say. The international markets are just as competitive as the domestic market. So whether or not that price sticks, remains to be seen, the price piece of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Did the sales decline in the Specialty business have a positive impact on the corporate gross margin? And if so, by how much?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","It's a good question, Connie. I don't have the number for you but the answer is, yes. And that's because the gross margins for the Specialty Products business are half of what the Consumer business is. But I don't have that math for you handy.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And also can you -- do you ever think of how the Specialty businesses fit into portfolio on a strategic basis over -- going forward?","James R. Craigie","Well, Connie, the Specialty Products business has been long part of this company. On a year-over-year basis, it matches [ph] about half the company average. But actually on a bottom line margin basis, it's very comparable to company because we don't spend much marketing money there. Cows haven't listened to our ads in a long time, so we gave up. So -- no, it's a very good business in the bottom line and I don't see reason why we would change that going forward.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just of course, a question on laundry. What is it that you have announced to the trade about your changes in either pricing or promotion? Will there be list price changes or is it increased trade promotion or more couponing or what's already been announced?","James R. Craigie","Connie, that's a no-no. I can't go into that kind of discussion.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session of today's call. Participants, you may now disconnect. Thank you for participating.","James R. Craigie","All right, thank you all very much for taking time to listen to us today. Just want to reiterate we stand behind the full year outlook in our earnings release, and again, hopefully gave you all the details. If you have any questions, give Matt a call after the conference today and we'll do our best to answer them. So thanks very much. Bye-bye."],"4601":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you on this call that the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filing.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Sir, please go ahead.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a few comments on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. When Rick is finished I will conclude with some final comments and we'll open up the call for questions.","Q2 was an outstanding quarter for our company. Organic sales growth was 4.4%, which exceeded our outlook of 3%, this performance was a clear standout in comparison to our peers. Earnings per share was $0.49 which exceeded our outlook by $0.03. Our reported sales growth was 14.5% which reflects strong organic growth and prior year acquisitions. Sales growth is clearly a powerful earnings lever in an environment with rising input costs. In the U.S. organic sales grew 5% with 6.2% volume growth.","Our categories are growing and our market shares are healthy; 11 of our 15 categories grew during the quarter, 9 categories have grown for at least three consecutive quarters. Beyond category growth our share results are solid with 7 out of 11 power brands growing or maintaining share. As we have said in the past, we have low exposure to private label, about 12% share on a weighted average basis. We're having success in the online class of trade. Global consumer online sales continue to grow and we expect it to exceed 6% of sales in 2018.","And finally, I'd like to give you perspective on the promotional environment, 8 of our 11 power brands had a lower percentage of products sold on promotion in Q2 compared to Q2 2017, and still we grew. And this is the second quarter that we've seen this and we don't expect that to change in the second half.","Our International Consumer business delivered 6.8% organic growth. As you know International has emerged as a growth driver for our company for the past four years. International markets are a bright spot for Church & Dwight, unlike many of our peers, the investments that we have made in new leadership, regional hubs and our brand focus continue to pay off. Our algorithm is 6% annual organic growth for the International business and we expect to meet or beat that number in 2018.","Turning to Specialty Products. Q2 was another challenging quarter for us with a 5% decline in organic sales. This reflects lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers, who are being hurt by low milk prices. There is a silver lining though, the acquisitions that we've made over the past couple of years, which got us into the poultry business have reduced our dependence on the dairy economy. So we continue to have confidence in our long-term algorithm of 5% organic sales growth for this business.","Now let's go back to the U.S. business for a minute to call out the drivers of our outstanding organic sales growth in the quarter. Our laundry brands reached an all-time high 18.8% share of liquid laundry in the quarter lead by OxiClean. Oxi Liquid Laundry had its highest ever share of 1.9%. ARM & HAMMER unit grew consumption 28%. Consistent with my earlier comment, the amount of detergent sold on promotion in the category was down 500 basis points sequentially from Q1 and down 70 basis points year-over-year.","vitafusion vitamins turned in a strong quarter with 6.2% consumption growth on the strength of increased distribution and velocity. Batiste continued to gain share with 36% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category and the category grew 33% in the quarter. Batiste is the number one dry shampoo for the tenth consecutive quarter and continues to be the number one dry shampoo in the world. Toppik and Viviscal turned in a strong quarter with 16% consumption growth. These outstanding hair care brands are growing because they deliver results to consumers with thinning hair.","Turning to innovation, innovation continues to be a big driver of our success. We have new products shipping in several categories, all of which have been performing well. In fact sales of our new products are ahead of our 2018 plan. We launched ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL lightweight unscented cat litter with guaranteed seven-day odor control which builds on the success of our CLUMP & SEAL franchise. We expanded our Odor Blasters laundry platform, leveraging technology that helps eliminate tough odors. We introduced new vitafusion and L'il Critters probiotics gummy vitamins which support digestive health. Trojan has launched NIRVANA which is an assortment of sensation condoms in an exclusive package design. Batiste continues to expand distribution with three unique fragrances leveraging our number one share position.","And finally Waterpik, Waterpik launched a really cool product this year. It's a water flosser to restore whiteness while flossing. Waterpik has been in the Church & Dwight family for a year now. The business is performing extremely well and we continue to expect high single-digit sales growth in 2018. We are looking at Waterpik as a global opportunity. The power of the combination of Waterpik and Church & Dwight is evident. We are laying the groundwork to sustain a strong growth rate in the future, particularly in international markets where household penetration is much lower than in the U.S.","So to conclude, we had a strong second quarter, we had a strong first half. We continue to outperform the market because we have brands consumers love, we have right strategies to grow and our company is a friend of the environment, which is important to us and our consumers, and our people make Church & Dwight a great place to work.","Next up is Rick, give you details on the second quarter, and the outlook for Q3 and the full year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Matt, and good morning everybody. I will start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.49 per share compared to an adjusted $0.41 in 2017, up 19.5%. The $0.49 was better than our $0.46 outlook. The $0.03 beat versus our outlook is made up of $0.03 from a stronger top line, a $0.02 drag on margin due to an oral care withdrawal and then $0.02 from a lower tax rate. Reported revenues were up 14.5% to over $1 billion.","Organic sales were up 4.4%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our domestic and international Consumer business. We're extremely pleased with our strong volume growth domestically of 6.2%. And as expected, our negative price mix continues to move in the right direction as I mentioned last quarter. We expect that improvement to continue as we move through the year and for the second half we expect that to be flat to positive.","Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic, the organic sales increased by 5%, primarily due to ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, Batiste dry shampoo, Viviscal and Toppik hair care brands, vitafusion and L'il Critters gummy vitamins, and XTRA Laundry Detergent.","International organic growth was up 6.8%, driven largely by OxiClean, Batiste, and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent in the export business. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and clumping cat litter, and Batiste in Canada, and OxiClean Ultra Gel and Nair in Mexico. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales declined 5% due to the lower volume offset a bit by pricing.","Turning now to gross margin, our second quarter gross margin was 44.3%, a 140 basis point decrease from a year ago. This includes a one-time 70 basis point impact from a voluntary recall and an FDA mandated withdrawal associated with certain oral care products. Other drivers were a 120 basis point drag for higher commodities, a 40 basis point drag from higher transportation costs, partially offset by our productivity program of 80 basis points and acquisitions of 10 basis points.","Moving now to marketing. Marketing was up $5.5 million year-over-year. The good news is we didn't cut any marketing, even excluding acquisitions our spending was up slightly. As a percentage of revenue marketing was 13.3%. Compared to Q1 marketing increased 340 basis points. For SG&A, Q2 SG&A increased 110 basis points year-over-year, higher SG&A primarily due to acquisitions, including intangible amortization and higher IT and R&D investment spending.","Now to operating profit. The operating margin for the quarter was 16.9%. Other expense all in was $18.4 million primarily driven by incremental interest expense and higher debt levels related to acquisitions. Next is income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 21.7% on an adjusted basis compared to 37.6% in 2017. We now expect the full year rate to be approximately 23%.","And now to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. For the first six months of 2018, net cash from operating activities was $322 million, an increase of $73 million from the prior year due to higher cash earnings and a smaller increase in working capital. Excluding prior year payments totaling $25 million for the UK pension plan settlement, and higher than normal deferred comp payments, cash from ops would have increased $48 million. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights were 4.4% organic sales growth and adjusted EPS growth of 19.5%.","Now turning to the third quarter outlook. We expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.53; a 2% reported increase year-over-year or an 8% increase on an adjusted basis. We expect marketing to be up in Q3 despite the acquisition mix impact I've spoken about.","And now turning to the full year, to summarize our thinking, we now expect organic sales to be 3.5%, reported sales growth to exceed 9%, which offsets the headwinds we discussed on gross margin. Full year gross margin will now be 120 basis points down, reflecting the full year impact of the oral care charges as well as higher logistics costs.","As a recap, our full year gross margin bridge is made up of a 130 basis points drag due to transportation and commodities, a 25 basis point drag for the oral care issues, a positive 35 basis points of price volume mix driven largely by volume and our full year marketing as a percent of sales will be 11.5%, reflecting the lower spend rates for recent acquisitions. In other words, absent acquisitions our marketing spend rate will be 12%, which again means our marketing dollars are up year-over-year.","We are raising our EPS outlook to be $2.26 to $2.28 per share or adjusted EPS growth of 17% to 18% despite the incremental headwinds from margin and currency. This continues to be top tier among the entire industry. And finally turning to cash, we're raising our expectations for cash from ops to $690 million. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Matt for a few more comments on pricing.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, before we open up the line for questions, I just want to take a minute to talk about pricing because I know it's on everybody's minds. So gross margin pressure has been felt across many industries over the past 12 months. We certainly have had our share of commodity and logistic cost increases and we have shared with you our actions to contain those costs, continuous improvement programs, hedging promotional efficiencies, just to name a few. Raising price is the other side of the equation, it's been top of mind this earnings season. So as you know, many CPG companies have already announced their intentions to take pricing to help offset their cost increases. We have reviewed our categories to determine if list price increases are cost justified and would deliver a positive financial result for both our company and for our retailers. And like our competitors, we have determined that in certain categories, pricing actions are necessary to help offset our cost increases. We are in the process of discussing those decisions with our retailers right now. We will not be going into specific details in this call in order to allow time for discussions with our retail partners to take place. But, we will report back with details in early November. We'll now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning guys.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Matt, I wanted to start on sort of state of union with the laundry category, your results were great, but specifically around Henkel and the strategy there where it seems like they're really leaning (14:17) and little else where you see (14:19) on some of their other key brands really under quite a bit of pressure and declining year-over-year.","And I'm not sure if you (14:26) specifically on sort of a key competitor strategy, but given your price point, you're positioning with ARM & HAMMER in the category. It would seem fair to say that the way their strategy is going really opens up quite a long runway for you to continue to source market share. So if you want to comment on that number one. And then number two, you know as you guys look at the data, is it fair to say that some of the strength in ARM & HAMMER, that you think it's coming from some of those brands that I just mentioned, then I have a follow up.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, well, it's difficult for me to comment on Henkel's strategy, but if you look at where the money is being spent, there's a significant amount of product sold on deal for Persil on the high-end, the same for Tide. So those guys are slugging it out at the high-end of the category and obviously you have to pay for that. So you could say that they're shifting some of the spend from their deep value brands which would be Purex and Sun and shifting it to Persil. I can't comment on whether or not that's going to continue. We have both XTRA and ARM & HAMMER both grew consumption in the second quarter, in fact, all three brands were up. So I would agree with you that ARM & HAMMER has a lot of runway for many years to come, it has been the banner brand for this company, it's a $1 billion brand if you add all the categories. It's the only advertised value brand. So we have so many things going for us that suggest that the train is going to keep on running in the future.","And, OxiClean we're encouraged by as well because it has its all-time high share, 1.9, in the quarter. As you know we've been trying to make inroads there into more of the premium end of the category. And XTRA \u2013 you remember XTRA last quarter stopped its slide, so it grew consumption last quarter and this quarter. So all three brands are clicking right now. So we feel real good about the laundry category.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","And, Matt, just, we'll stick with that and then I'll pass it on, but a couple of other questions in laundry. How do you feel about pricing \u2013 frontline pricing, the category is benefiting from some favorable mix for the reasons we just talked about with Henkel leaning in on Persil. What's your view on pricing? We've obviously had episodic price wars over the years in the category; that doesn't seem to be the case now. If you can just comment on that and maybe the outlook for the balance of the year. And then also early observations on Tide Simply and Proctor's introduction there in unit dose? And then I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well look, when it comes to activity in pricing, it's really a broader issue. So, it all goes back to pressure on gross margins. So, you know, cost increases have been seen for raw impacting inputs pretty broadly and you got a tightening labor market. So wages can also be a contributing factor. So, you got a lot of things going against you and everybody is dealing with this. And productivity gains have been outrun by cost increases and that's why you're seeing people reaching for \u2013 for pricing finally. And the commodity pressure has led to two quarters of year-over-year decline in the amount sold on deal. I don't think that's coincidental, that, I think that will likely continue. And I think the need for profits will likely result in greater reluctance to even deal back price increases once people implement them.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And, Kevin, it's Rick. I think one thing that we said last quarter and I want to repeat it again this quarter is our negative price mix trend in the Domestic business, right, in Q1 it was down 170 bps, in Q2 it is down 120 bps. We expect that to be flat to positive in the second half because as some of those promotions don't get repeated, or some of the couponings don't get repeated, not just in laundry but in general, in this environment we expect that to happen.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And back to your question on the launch of Tide Simply unit dosed. So the unit dose category grew 4.3% in the quarter. I think it's the fourth consecutive quarter that unit dose as a category has grown less than 5%. And if the short answer is to how are we doing is, ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 28% in the quarter. So I would say that the Simply Tide launch has not slowed down our growth.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. Good morning.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I had a question on your strong Consumer Domestic organic sales. I guess, I'm wondering why there is such a big disconnect between your very strong results in the quarter and then the weaker Nielsen scanner data. Was the difference mainly driven by non-tracked channels or were there timing impacts from your shipments?","And then going forward, how should we think about the contribution from non-tracked business? And then maybe finally, could you characterize the overall health of your inventory levels at retail? Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, I'll start with the last one first. It's Rick, Bonnie. But we track shipment to consumption data all the time. We feel like that's very healthy. It's right in line where it should be. So we don't think that's an issue. Your first question is really, help bridge the organic growth for the domestic division of around 5% back to what we would call the Nielsen tracked growth, which is around 2%.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","So that's about 300 basis points. About 200 basis points is untracked channels whether that's e-commerce, you know e-commerce for us is growing you know 30%, 40%, which is really strong. As Matt said in his prepared remarks that's, for a company, for the consumer business to be in excess of 6% of sales, and then other non-tracked partners as well. And then, so that's around 200 basis points of that 300 basis points gap and another 100 basis points is just lower couponing, right, as we talked about before. We're lapping, for example, we launched a major litter innovation last year for trial, some of the coupon has come down in laundry as well. So the disconnect is really just from a net sales perspective.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then just maybe a quick follow on to that because as I look over the last three quarters, it was more in line. So just thinking through the strength that you're seeing in online, was there a huge step up this quarter for your business? Because you didn't really see that kind of spread in the last few quarters relative to the tracked channel. So just trying to think through how your online business has been performing?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, I would just tell you that typically the untrack stuff is just lumpy; online in general is lumpy. So, I think anybody who gives you a forecast on trying to bridge for organic growth to what reported or Nielsen information shows you is just, is asking for trouble. It's just too lumpy to do that accurately. I would tell you there's always going to be a disconnect and in some quarters there's going to be larger than others.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just maybe one final question from me on your Q3 EPS growth guidance, it seems a little light versus what you just printed and then what's implied for Q4, you called out stepped up marketing spend. So, I'm curious you know how much is maybe being pulled forward from Q4 and if so, why? And then also, you know, you're expecting commodity and freight headwinds, you know, are you expecting that to moderate by the time we get to Q4? Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, a couple, two good questions. The first one on just the timing. Remember first half of the year, on average, we're about 20% EPS growth. In Q3, we're calling 8% EPS growth. Behind that is we have a step up investment in marketing, we've moved some marketing from Q4 as an example into Q3. So, we're up on a dollar basis about $8 million to $10 million of marketing year-over-year in Q3, which is about another $0.03 and if you just kind of add that back then you're really up around 14% adjusted in the third quarter.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And something else just to keep in mind, we've seen this phenomenon before. Sometimes, we have a front-end loaded year and the way we manage the business is to deliver on the EPS call that we gave in February. So to the extent that we're out running that, we're going to be able to spend it back.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And then in terms of your other question on distribution or commodities, in general, we gave you the full year outlook from gross margin and I did a bridge for you, about 130 basis points year-over-year for the full year. That's pretty consistent in the second half. You know as logistics costs have come through and I think you heard from Kimberly as an example, the pulp prices are up and diesel prices remain high.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, I guess first one maybe just a little more color on Waterpik a year later and just kind of where that growth is coming from? And then, I would assume this is the one business that could be affected by tariffs. So maybe kind of any commentary on what you see on margins, pricing there.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, yes, the business has been, was growing well in 2017 and it's growing high single digits this year. And the formula is that 60% of the purchases are based on a hygienist or a dentist recommendation. And that continues, and one thing we've done is we've expanded the number of hygienists that we have calling on dentists in the United States with great success. That would be one element. The second element is international, this is just a huge opportunity internationally, and we're beginning to establish in a small way the hygienist program in other countries. And that's going to bear fruit for us for years.","With respect to the tariff, this is kind of a global comment. It's, the tariff, with respect to China, the current thinking is the exposure's mainly batteries and electronics, but it's not anything that's material right now. The new layers of tariffs could impact a broad range of products, materials, but it's something that we'll just be monitoring closely in the coming months. But so far the stuff that is in place wouldn't have a material effect on us.","And just while we're on the topic of tariffs, I know some people have some interest in Canada, and Canada, with Canada's retaliatory tariffs were a larger issue for some of our competitors because it's a very broad list of categories, including things like shaving products, automatic dish washing, products for deodorizing rooms, skin care products. For us, it had a minimal impact essentially on deodorizing products, so like Fridge Fresh would be one that would be caught up on that, it's like a 10% tariff. But really Canadian retaliatory tariffs and Chinese retaliatory tariffs are immaterial right now.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And then, and just going back to Waterpik real quick.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","You say it's going to, two-thirds of the growth is coming domestic and one-third of that is coming in the international expansion, is that the right way to think about it?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I'd still say that it's more skewed towards the domestic business than international.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just the other question, back on laundry, I actually was kind of surprised by Oxi's market share and kind of resurgence. Anything more, I mean is that sustainable, is there something that you're replacing? It seemed to be, I wouldn't say left for dead but it had been very quiet on Oxi detergent for quite some time.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, look, Bill, we're still fighting an uphill battle there, because you know we have formidable competitors there in both Tide and Persil. So we're still trying to make sure we have a sustainable beachhead going forward. And it has been, use the word lumpy, it's been a bit of a seesaw. We're up 1.9% one quarter, you're down \u2013 your share is 1.5% the next quarter, so we're still trying to break through there and we do that through both coupons, digital coupons, et cetera. So I wouldn't say that we're declaring victory right now.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Okay. I'm not hearing anybody. Wonder if we lost the connection.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Operator, why don't we go to the next caller?","Operator","Your line is open, sir.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right. Somebody bailed. Go to the next one.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Hey. So, more on pricing if I could. So, I know you said that 8 of 11 categories this quarter showed a lower percentage of products sold on deal versus 2017. And Rick, I think you even called out lower couponing in the quarter which is great. But how do we reconcile that with your overall price mix still being negative in the consumer domestic segment, despite lapping some extremely intense promotions in the year-ago period. That just to me, it doesn't all tie together and it's very surprising. So what's the missing variable? Is it that the breadth of promotion may be down, but the depth is still up or is something else going on that I'm missing?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, no, it's a good question. I think I want you to ask that same question next quarter, Steve. And I think a lot of the heavier promotion that we had was actually in Q3, not as much in Q2. So that's why we're expecting as we go through the second half to have positive price mix and a flat to positive price mix in the second half.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But I mean, okay, your price mix was negative 6% last year, that's pretty intense. You got some big launches, no in Q2?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. No. You're right. We had plus 6% on volume, minus 6% on negative price mix, but it wasn't all promotional spending. That was also, I think I talked about it last year, our household business was growing very fast. Our personal care business was actually in decline, all right. So there are other attributes besides just spending promotional dollars.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I mean, that's fair. But I guess I just want to press a little bit more and just and test it in the context of what we heard from P&G a few days ago. Because on the one hand, and others, but on the one hand, their intention to raise pricing in a couple categories, tissues, diapers, got a lot of attention and I think has prompted a lot of optimism, and I appreciate your optimism with respect to kind of net pricing going forward. But at the same time if I look at what they actually did, they spent a whole lot more than expected in the quarter on couponing and trade investments and essentially signaled that pricing would remain negative for them through the duration of the calendar year. And I just \u2013 it doesn't \u2013 it just it seems like there is a disconnect between what we're seeing in the quarter and that optimism and I just want to test where your optimism is coming from in that context.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, I have one or two comments then maybe Matt has something to add too, but in general we just went through with Kevin Grundy's question about how a lot of the spending in laundry between Tide and Persil has happened in the premium end, right. In general it's encouraging to say sequentially from Q1 to Q2 amount sold on deal's down by almost 500 basis points. So, yeah they might be up, they might be up, but the category was down even sequentially Procter, as an example, was down 770 basis points sequentially, in amount sold on deal from Q1 to Q2. In a world where commodities are rising, labor is rising; I think that promotional spending will come in line.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I would add to that, Steve, is we've been jumping around here between Kimberly in paper products and back to Tide and detergent. I think, you know, when you are looking at a company, you have to look at what are the categories that we're in; we're in 15 categories. So, on a weighted average basis, our categories have been growing, you know, close to 3% for several quarters now. And, you know, that's what's, makes it so buoyant for us. And you know Rick's right in that, you can look at how, what the laundry war is going on in the premium end, but it's not going on in the value end.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. I will look forward to a positive number in Q3. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thanks, Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","So, I have two housekeeping, I guess questions, to start. So first, is it possible to get the blended category growth rates in the U.S. and then with your full year guidance for this year, do you at all incorporate any pricing benefits that you expect to take?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","What is the second one?","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","For your guidance this year, your full year guidance. Do you \u2013 have you built in any pricing benefits for some of the pricing actions you're hoping to take down the road?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. We would make no commentary on pricing just yet, what categories we're, what retailers or what impact it may have.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, more than happy to answer that, Rupesh, next quarter when you ask.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. You had another housekeeping question.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah. The blended, yeah I was hoping to get the blending category growth rates in the U.S. if you look at all your categories?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, well, I mentioned earlier that in general that the weighted average rate has been approximately 3% for the last four quarters, specifically it was 2.7% weighted growth in Q2.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, okay. Okay, great. Then in the Specialty Products business, so clearly the dairy side has been challenged lately. So what gives you confidence that you can get back up to that 5% type growth longer term?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, you know it has been a cyclical business historically. We do have some things right now that are exacerbating the situation with what our government is doing. So we have retaliatory tariffs being imposed on being imposed on cheese by Mexico. Mexico is the largest export market for U.S. cheese. So, our retaliatory tariffs by China on whey protein, that's another derivative of dairy industry. And China is the largest export market for U.S. whey protein. So, these duties are slowing the exports of U.S. products and the prices of all dairy products are expected to be soft as a result. We've got storm clouds right now. So, I do think that's going to clear at some point.","What gives us confidence long term is the fact that we've now made three acquisitions that have got us into other species, meaning cattle and pork. And we do think that over time that's going to even out. And because those three acquisitions were in prebiotics, probiotics and also food safety, we think there's a lot of runway there and that because we've put those three businesses together and we can now go to food producers and offer control of bacteria both pre-harvest and post-harvest, we think we got a big runway, but we do have to even it out. We've got to get more balance between dairy and the other species in the future, but we're confident we're going to get there, Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. First, just a point of clarification actually on price mix on international, because that moved \u2013 that was a pretty big change relative to Q1, the one \u2013 the down 1.4% versus a plus 5% in Q1. And the things you cited last quarter don't seem like things that would whip around that much. So, was there any rollback on the pricing in Mexico or a big step change in the mix of products or if you could just give a little bit more color on that dynamic between Q1 and Q2?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Sure. Hi Olivia, it's Rick. In general it was two things. Everything we said last quarter is still true right, going direct to the German subsidy helped in a positive way, price mix for example. But it was overshadowed by a couple things. Now we have heavier trade promotion in the UK and Australia, we have good volume growth there too, but just heavier trade promotion in those two countries and then in Mexico we also have our household business growing very quickly and so that also hurt the mix impact a little bit. And so in general for the balance of the year we expect it to look, actually, a lot like Q2, high volume growth and a little bit of price mix.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then just in terms of the second half organic sales growth obviously it implies, if you're going to get to 3.5% for the year, for growth to decelerate. Obviously, you don't want to get too far ahead of your skis, but what are some of the key factors driving a potential slowdown in second half growth versus first half, because you seem to downplay the benefits from Henkel's challenges, you're obviously feel quite bullish about laundry. Would assume that you expect price mix to improve based on the comments that you cited earlier. So, just trying to understand whether that's just healthy conservatism or something that you see coming down the road?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, I think you need to take a step up a little bit, Olivia. It's more, we think we have momentum going into the second half at or exceeding our first half. And the way we look at that is we just look at it on a two year stack basis and really if you remember domestic growth in the first half of the year, last year was really low, the second half it was stronger. So on a stacked basis, the first half the year is 6.2% for example and we expect to exceed that you know 6.3%, 6.4% in the back half of the year. So again it's, just look at it on a two year basis. So it's more of a comp story.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just want to go back to pricing, not surprisingly, in terms of the pricing that you're contemplating. I know that you know you don't want to get very specific here, but is that mostly U.S. or will that be an international component to it? Given the move in the dollar I would think that that might make that a little more challenging?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, look the \u2013 here's what I can say. I mean this is internationally we have raised price already in 2018 in emerging markets; that would be places like Mexico and Brazil as well as our Latin export markets, and that's both for household and for personal care products. So, that's one thing I can tell you that's been in place in 2018. I wouldn't make any comments about 2019 or even second half changes for international. But look, the U.S. is 80% of our business, right. So obviously it's going to be a pretty important lever to affect price increases in the U.S., but no comment on percentages or categories.","Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And in terms of whether you guys are leading or following, I imagine most of these categories will be situations where you're following somebody else or could you be leading in categories like condoms, for example?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, you know what, we're starting to play 20 questions. So, no \u2013 good try, Joe. But I think we really don't want to comment any further that. We really want to give ourselves a chance to have our conversations with retailers.","Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And just one last one, this is a little bit easier I think. Are you guys surprise you haven't seen more competition and in more new entrance in the dry shampoo category given how fast it's growing?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, actually there have been you know some new entrants. So for example you know J&J showed up with OGX, right, OGX dry shampoo. And I know in Germany, Nivea has got a dry shampoo that they launched. So, yeah, I mean it's attracting a lot attention. But you know the category grew, in the U.S. grew 33%. Our brand grew 36%, so this is even with new entrants, so...","Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Still taking share despite that obviously.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, yeah. Right, right, right. So it's a fabulous brand, it's just, it really delivers a great consumer experience and I think that's the reason why we continue to grow.","Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is open.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning. We've covered a lot already, but I was curious one point, Rick, you said earlier that the, that online sales were going to be and have been pretty lumpy. And I was just curious why. Like, I can certainly understand untracked channel sales being lumpy whether it's club or whatever else. But I just, I would think online would be sort of steady rate of demand. So if you could just explain a little bit why that would be the case just as for my understanding? Thanks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, so Lauren, this is Matt. You may remember at CAGNY we talked about this at one point where we woke up one Monday morning and none of our litter products were being offered. Amazon decided that they weren't making enough margin on that, so they were gonzo. So the online retailers do control the shelf and they can with a keystroke they could pretty much take you off.","We have been making some adjustments in some of our categories as far as what SKUs we offer online. In some cases, we say you know what, we're a little bit too broad and we pare back. So, if we say, let's say we had 40 SKUs in one particular category and we say, now we're going to go down to 10, you could have a loss of online sales for that particular category. And the inverse is true as well. So, it's a shift from the online, from the bricks-and-mortar to online, but it doesn't all, it's a little choppy at times.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That helps a lot. Thanks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. Question for Matthew, and a question for Rick. Matthew where, obviously with the price and value dynamics, where do you think in terms of household penetration, size of the category, unit dose in laundry peaks and maybe both for yourself and for the category? You referenced the slower growth in unit dose over the past few quarters. Just curious your thoughts on that. And for Rick, what dynamics are allowing for the better cash flow realization particularly seems like better payables performance so far this year? Thanks very much.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'd say this, when unit dose was first launched, I think a lot of people look to Europe and say okay, there's more prevalence of unit dose in Europe and that comes in different forms and if you're including tablets and said well, hey there's one country that 30% of the laundry detergent is a unit dose. The other analogy is, dish washing detergent in the U.S. that's 30 and higher percentage of product is unit dose. So that was sort of the going in expectation, but it has plateaued for the last four quarters. It's in 17% and then went up to 17.4%, 17.6%, maybe it's 17.8% right now. And what we have found over time is that when unit dose was first launched, there was a decline in the liquid laundry detergent category. And the reason for that was because overdosing really stopped with the use of unit dose. But then the growth restarted and liquid laundry has been growing alongside a unit dose for several years now. So, I don't have a crystal ball, but it's not obvious that there's a path to 30%.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And then to follow on your second question, just what's leading to our great cash flow generation. I think even the raise that we just talked about, the incremental $10 million, typically it's half cash earnings and half of that's working capital. Over the long term we've done a phenomenal job on working capital, talked many times about how we've gone from 52 days to in the 20s on our cash conversion cycle. And that has been lead \u2013 we're top tier in inventory. We're right in line with everybody else on DSO or receivables. And then, we still have some room to improve on payables and so that does continue. So hopefully that gives you a flavor for it.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. So my questions are like just two clarifications. First on the pricing as it relates to guidance. Should we assume reducing couponing the third quarter (45:15) and list pricing more into the fourth quarter and also are you expecting to increase prices on the private labels you manufacture as well or this is mostly on the branded products?","And second, on the taxes, your new guidance is around 23%, if I understood it correctly from your prepared remarks for the year. So that is to imply because your taxes were so low in the first half of the year, so that is to imply about 24% on the second half. So if that is the case, are you expecting really like this whole pricing situation and lapping a lot of the components you mentioned before and also with increased marketing spending into the third quarter and then that's going to ease off. So your operating results are really going to have to be very strong in the fourth quarter for you to meet the guidance. Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Part one, let me try to take those in order. First of all on pricing, we said we're not going to comment anymore on pricing, so we're not going to comment on private label, on branded, on list price. Come back next quarter and we'll go through any impact that may or may not have on the outlook. You asked about couponing. When I said positive, flat to positive price mix on the organic line for the Consumer Domestic business in the back half, yes it's promotions are lower and couponing is lower year-over-year. That's a fair comment to make.","On the tax outlook, yes, it implies a 23% for the year implies a 24% rate in the back half. We had a lower than 24% rate in the front half largely because of option exercises, and that number is volatile and that moves around, and it's difficult to forecast. But in general, we said approximately 23% now for the full year. And then, you did allude as well to marketing shifts, I talked about that in Q3, higher marketing spending Q3, coming out of Q4 operating results are going to be just as solid as they were in the first half, in the second half. So, we \u2013 you should see our confidence in our guidance, because we raised our outlook.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason, there's always room for you man.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I appreciate that. Congratulations on the great volume this quarter. It was impressive. I wanted to come back. I have two questions, one on price and one on gross margin. Imagine that, another price question. But I wanted to come back and just re-ask Steve Powers' question, because I thought it was a good one. You're lapping some promotions. You've got 100 basis point benefit from couponing in price this quarter. Personal Care is now mixing higher 8 of 11 brands, power brands promos down. Why is price negative? I still don't understand that.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we have incremental trade spending in a couple of our categories, right. We have \u2013 that's probably in essence the easiest way to say it. That's why price mix is still negative in the Consumer business. It's a competitive environment. Although, it is getting better, I think people forget context sometimes. Back in Q3 of 2017, also goes back to your question, Q2 of 2017, price mix was minus 630 bps; in Q3, it was minus 490 bps; in Q4, it's down to 130 bps; and in Q1, we're down 170 bps; in Q2, we're down 120 bps. And so, the curve is coming down in the right direction. We're seeing the macro stuff support that and that's why we have confidence in the back half to continue to improve.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Very good. I appreciate that. And then, quickly on gross margins. I guess there are a few moving pieces, I could throw a few questions at you, but I'm going to try to stay focused on one. Commodities and freight, you're calling for a 130 basis point headwind for the full year, I think it was 100 basis point last quarter, you were 85% hedged, suggesting you're seeing movement on that 15%, is that right? And given the hedge position and I know if you go through you 10-Q, you've got a lot of commodity derivatives that historically you haven't really had. Should we be \u2013 should we be concerned that as your hedges sort of roll off you've got another step higher of inflationary pressure as we roll into next year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, good question, both of them were good questions. On the first one, I would tell you, let me try to simplify it; our outlook was 80 basis points of decline in margin. We've moved to 120 basis point decline in margin for the year, that's two pieces, 25 basis points was really because of the oral care withdrawal and then about 15 basis points is logistics. And logistics, just to give you a sense of what that really is, now we're \u2013 we saw some more inflation on inbound freight as an example that gets rolled through on material pricing. And we also are seeing, you know that we have shipments that go from the U.S. to Canada, there is a higher spot pricing because truckers don't want to come down from Canada into the U.S. in a more regulatory environment with all the new labor laws and whatnot for truckers.","So there's a little more spot pricing there than we expected, nothing that material. So in general commodities are still and distribution is about 130 basis points year-over-year drag. I guess that's the big picture. Your second question Jason, can you remind me with that was?","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","85% hedged as of last quarter, lots of derivative contracts in the 10-Q that we haven't seen in the past, what's the risk of you sort of these rolling off into a higher cost environment into next year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, yeah. Really, the biggest hedges we have out there are really for and you'll see this in the 10-Q are for surfactants or ethylene for HTPE for resin and for diesel, and net-net as they're close to washing. I mean it's nice to have certainty and now we're 88% hedged and we're already hedging 2019 in some cases in order to again have predictable movements on our cost structure. But in general, I'd say those net differences aren't that material.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Helpful. I appreciate it, I'll pass it on.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to go back to Olivia's question, just as a clarification first. So I still don't necessarily understand the back half commentary, especially as you have Waterpik hitting the organic base, so that would suggest if you sort of backed that away, that the two-year gets somewhat worse. So I guess are you being conservative or are there things that you're baking in there from a geopolitical standpoint that you're expecting potentially to worsen, maybe just a little bit of color in that context?","And then just secondly, separately, the growth in the untracked channels online specifically. How should we think about the opportunity or white space to put more product into those channels going forward, meaning sustainability of that relative to not the overall category growth, but just incremental in terms of putting more product there on the virtual shelve. And then just what about the broad level of support or spending for brands in that channel versus track channels, meaning is it lower, is that rate increasing sort of normalizing versus traditional brick-and-mortar? Any sort of help there will be useful.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, I'll take a swing at the online class of trade and then Rick will comment on your second half sales question. So, the online class of trade sales grew 40% in the quarter year-over-year. So, that would include both our direct-to-consumer business as well as anything we sell in the online class of trade. Now, all of that as you know is not incremental. So, you essentially have consumers moving from one class of trade off from bricks-and-mortar to the online class of trade.","You had a question about the cost associated with that and it is more costly to serve the online class of trade, because you do have to create web pages, you have to maintain them to your; so the maintenance part of it is expensive. It can be less expensive for digital marketing, because I'm sure you've heard that over the past couple of years that the number of impression is less expensive online than actually going through television for example.","So, it's a bit of mix there. We had 1% of our sales were online in 2015, it was 5%, 2017. We expect to easily exceed 6% this year. So, it is going to continue to grow. The gross margins right now are somewhat comparable between the online class of trade and bricks-and-motors, so it's not really hurting us from a profitability standpoint on the gross profit line. But it is more expensive to serve that class of trade from an SG&A standpoint. I hope that helps you.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And then in terms of the second half dynamic you're asking about and Olivia did as well. Again, on a stacked basis, we have a strong first half and we have even higher second half. And yes, Waterpik is a tailwind, but let's drill into the volume for a second. First half, volume domestically on average was around 3.5%. And last year, volume on average was 5.5%. And so, we've told you a couple of times that we don't need to spend as much on coupon as an example in the back half of the year because we do have all these tailwinds that we've talked about. So, in general, we think the momentum was very strong and we feel good about it. Is that it?","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right. That concludes the call today. We'll be talking to you again in November after the end of the third quarter. Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"5093":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Matt Farrell - Chief Executive Officer","Rick Dierker - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Cody Ross - Goldman Sachs","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank","Steve Strycula - UBS","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead.","Matt Farrell","Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll provide a few comments on the quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is finished, we'll open up the call for questions.","Our Q2 was another outstanding quarter for our company. We have lots of good news including higher than expected organic sales growth and earnings per share growth. Q2 reported sales grew 5%. Organic sales growth was 4.9%, which exceeded our outlook of 3.5%. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.57, exceeding our outlook by $0.05. In the U.S., organic sales grew 5%. Our categories are growing. In fact, 13 of our 15 categories grew during the quarter and our market shares were healthy as evidenced by 9 of our 12 power brands growing or holding share.","We continue to have success in the online class of trade. Online sales continue to grow rapidly at a 28% clip this quarter. And we expect online sales to exceed 8% of our annual sales in 2019 compared to 7% of 2018. Our international consumer business delivered another terrific quarter with 9.1% organic growth. International is a growth driver and a perennial bright spot for Church & Dwight. This is unlike many of our peers. U.K., Mexico and our Global Markets Group, which we formally referred to as our export business, had particularly strong quarters. But one final note on international. We exited our Brazilian subscale consumer business in the quarter.","Now turning to Specialty Products, Q2 was another challenging quarter, as organic sales declined 5.4%. We are experiencing lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers, who continue to be hurt by low milk prices. Milk prices increased in April, May, and June, and recent industry forecasts are projecting milk prices to continue to rise throughout the second half.","We still feel good about our long-term 5% organic sales algorithm as a result of our acquisitions of businesses serving other species like poultry, cattle and swine. Non-dairy represents approximately 25% of our animal productivity business right now and we expect that non-dairy business to grow sales approximately 10% this year.","Let's go back to the U.S. Consumer business for a moment and call out a couple of bright lights in the quarter. In the laundry category, which grew 1.2%, ARM & HAMMER margin consumption was up 9.5% and we gained 0.8 share points. As anticipated, the promotional environment in laundry continued to be muted in Q2. For our part, we reduced ARM & HAMMER laundry percentage promotion by 220 basis points, while maintaining growth. We expect to continue reducing our year-over-year promotional spend in the second half.","Our new product ARM & HAMMER FADE DEFENSE is doing well and meeting our expectations. Over in personal care, the new line of BATISTE Hair Benefits has given consumers the ability to shop for dry shampoo, the same way they shop the broader hair care category. By that, I mean by benefit. In particular, our new BATISTE volumizing was the number one skew in dollar sales growth in the dry shampoo category in Q2. Our new BATISTE hydrating product for women with fine hair is also doing well.","BATISTE continues to gain share with a 33% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category, more than doubling the category growth of 16%. BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo for the 14th consecutive quarter. Next new product to talk about is NAIR LEG MASK. NAIR LEG MASKS have been a hit with consumers driving our brand to a record high 70.2% dollar share of depilatories in Q2. I want to point out that Rick and I right now are in Fort Collins, Colorado. We're spending time with WATERPIK team and we're seeing firsthand the great momentum that this business is generating. A great example is that WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION launch is exceeding expectations for 2019. We have high levels of interest from both dental professionals and consumers.","And with SONIC-FUSION you may recall consumers can floss and brush at the same time. And in the month of June SONIC-FUSION was our best-selling ordepic model at key retail accounts. Let's talk about price increases now. As you know, price increases were executed in late 2018 and in April 2019 and contributed to our gross margin expansion. We said last quarter the volume impacts on the brands in which we took price were better than we expected and that continues to be the case.","In terms of category health for the five categories where we took pricing late last year, all five categories are showing positive category growth despite volume impacts. We closed the FLAWLESS acquisition in May and the integration plan is on track. We are excited to own the market leader in women's electric hair removal products. FLAWLESS is a fast-growing brand which complements our specialty hair care business and we expect FLAWLESS to grow sales 15% annually or higher and contribute to our long-term growth both domestically and international. In conclusion, we had a terrific quarter. We feel really good about the rest of the year. We're on track to exceed our evergreen business model in 2019.","Next up is Rick to give you details on the second quarter and the outlook for Q3 and the improved full year.","Rick Dierker","Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57 per share compared to $0.49 in 2018, up 16.3%. The $0.57 exceeded our outlook of $0.52 largely due to better topline, improved gross margin, a shift in marketing and lower tax. Q2 reported EPS was $0.55. We have three adjustments to get to adjusted EPS. First is related to the sale of our consumer business in Brazil. This is a $7 million or $0.03 charge that was largely non-cash.","Second, we had favorability of approximately $7 million or $0.02 in relation to reducing the earnout for our Passport acquisition within our SPD business. We're still happy with our entry to the food safety business and the diversification that it offers our SPD division. Lastly, as we mentioned last quarter, we booked an earnout adjustment for the FLAWLESS business, largely based and attached to time. These FLAWLESS earnout adjustments will continue quarterly. Reported revenue was up 5%. Organic sales were up 4.9%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 3.5%. Q2 was the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 4% organic growth and the fourth consecutive quarter of positive price and product mix.","Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 5% as positive price and mix drove a 5.9% increase. This was slightly offset by negative volume of 0.9% due to lower OXICLEAN laundry promotional spending and the expected volume decline associated with announced price increases. Growth was led by ARM & HAMMER liquid, ARM & HAMMER pumping cat litter, WATERPIK oral care products, OXICLEAN stain fighters, VITAFUSION Gummy Vitamins, XTRA liquid laundry detergent and ARM & HAMMER scent boosters.","International organic growth was up 9.1%, driven primarily by our ARM & HAMMER, BATISTE and VMS power brands. For SPD division, organic sales declined 5.4%. And although demand for our products continue to grow in the poultry industry, demand in the dairy industry continues to be a challenge.","Turning now to gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin was 44.6%, a 30 basis point increase from a year ago due to price increases, the impact of acquisitions and productivity programs, partially offset by higher commodity and manufacturing costs. This performance once again exceeded our expectation and we now expect full year gross margin to be up 80 basis points. This represents a 30 basis point increase to our previous gross margin outlook and is attributable to a more favorable forecast on commodities as well as the impact of acquisitions.","On the commodity side, one example of the recent gross margin forecast change is upwind. Three months ago, we would've expected the back half of 2019 to be up over 20% compared to 2018. The latest information that we have indicates that prices will now be flat to down year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are largely hedged on most of our key commodities.","Moving now to -- down $7.3 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percent of sales decreased 130 basis points to 12%. And we have shifted some spend to the second half. This is largely as expected as some retail resets have been pushed later in the year. For example additives and litter. We are raising our full year expectations for marketing as a percent of sales to be flat with 2018, an increase of 20 basis points since our last outlook.","For SG&A, Q2 reported SG&A increased 120 basis points year-over-year. SG&A as percent of sales would have been flat excluding impact from the FLAWLESS acquisition as well as the previously discussed onetime items such as Brazil and the earnout adjustments.","Adjusted net operating profit. Operating margin for the quarter was 17.8%, representing 90 basis point increase over Q2 2018. Other expense all-in was $17.1 million. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 18.7% compared to 21.7% in 2018, a decrease of 300 basis points primarily driven by higher number of stock options exercised.","And now to cash. For the first half of 2019, net cash from operating activities was $351 million, a $28.5 million increase from the prior year driven by higher cash earnings. Now one metric to note is our cash earnings are up 15% year-to-date versus a year ago.","And now for the full year. We now expect organic sales growth to be approximately 4%, up from our previous outlook of 3.5%. The organic outlook for the divisions are 3.5% for domestic, 7.5% for international and down slightly for SPD. We now expect reported sales growth of approximately 6%. We now expect full year gross margin to be up 80 basis points. And we continue to expect full year operating margin to increase 50 basis points. We now expect 2019 adjusted EPS of $2.47 per share or adjusted EPS growth of 9%. This is at the upper end of the range of our previous 79% outlook. Similar to prior years to the extent that the business outperforms this guidance, we will look to reinvest the earnings to continue our momentum.","And with that, Matt and I will be happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. You may begin.","Kevin Grundy","Hey good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Matt Farrell","Hey Kevin.","Rick Dierker","Hi Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Let's start on pricing. So, obviously, it's very good right now in HPC. And commodity outlook Rick as you mentioned is more favorable. Matt, curious how you assess risk on a couple of fronts. Number one, the competitors start to become more promotional on price. And then two, also potential that retailers see this -- excuse me moderation in commodity cost and conversations begin to open up around the potential for more trade investments from manufacturers. And then I have a follow-up.","Matt Farrell","Okay. Here's the way I would think about it, Kevin. We've had only four left quarters of higher prices being in effect and the price increases were justified by cost increases that had accumulated over many years from many CPG companies including us. And it is true that some of the input cost appeared to be flattening or decreasing. But big commodities always get headlines but there are other input costs that don't necessarily follow the same trends.","So it depends on product category that you're in. So I'd caution again I'd say pulp and paper may be down, may be resin abating and that's a barometer to put respect for all the costs that justified the price increases. You've got to also keep in mind retailers are making more money now too. So making more penny profit as a result of the price increases. So to the extent there's a gross profit help because it would appear some input cost might be abating, I wouldn't expect everybody to be jumped to reinvesting in price maybe much more reasonable innovation as healthy categories compete on innovation. Of course, the changes we'll respond to it.","Kevin Grundy","Okay, all right. Thanks, Matt. One follow-up and I'll pass it on. Laundry so a two-part question one on liquid and one on unit there. So promo levels are down and you guys have talked about the opportunity to take down promo levels. It looks like you're following that course, but at the same time market share has started to slow here a little bit. Maybe speak to a little bit how you're trying to strike that right balance between taking promo levels down essentially getting the factor price increase with market share objectives?","And then the second part is unit dose where you're also pulling back on promotion. And Matt I guess for you as you talk about the opportunity to potentially get \u201cyour fair share\u201d in the category given the company's slow start going back six or seven years ago, but that hasn't really played out at least perhaps at the pace maybe that the company would have hoped. So why don't you think we've seen more rapid market share gains in unit dose from ARM & HAMMER with P&G still sitting there at 80% market share. And I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Matt Farrell","Well, the unit dose categories continues to grow. It's around 17%, 18% right now. I would say that the unit dose growth has been exceptional for ARM & HAMMER. We were growing double-digits virtually every quarter since it launched. The unit dose category had slowed it only grew 6.8% this quarter. But ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 16%. So look we're still climbing the ladder here. We only had the OXICLEAN as well as that component of unit dose, but of course that's abated quite a bit. OXICLEAN was down significantly year-over-year because we did cut back on promotion. So remember that's at the premium end.","If you look at the what's going on for value laundry detergent year-over-year see if you look at Tide simply Purex and so on -- ARM & HAMMER everybody's pulled back in the second quarter. So that's a trend we've seen now for pretty much four consecutive quarters. So we'd expect that continue in the second half and that is our plan right now. Of course if that changes, we can react quickly.","Rick Dierker","And I would just add Kevin even with that pull back ARM & HAMMER continues to gain share, right? Really the pull back in Oxi laundry is where maybe there's some share to find.","Matt Farrell","Yeah, I mean, ARM & HAMMER share is 11% of the laundry category and now we're up 80 bps in the second quarter, so it's pretty significant.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. You may begin.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on the next quarter. So as we look at pricing, so if we look at the volume price trade off that you saw during the quarter, will that in line with your expectations?","Matt Farrell","Yeah, it was. I mean, for the company we talked about 4.8% price\/mix and volume is relatively flat, for domestic business it was 5.9% positive price\/mix and volume was down 0.9%. And if you strip out the record pull back on Oxi laundry volume would have been positive. So Q2 probably looks a lot like the full year the next few quarters in my mind.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. And then from a category perspective, it sounds like you actually had more categories that grew this quarter. So as you look at your data, what was the blended category growth in the areas you can see versus maybe the prior quarters?","Matt Farrell","Yeah. It's pretty consistent. It's about 3%.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. And then my final question on the FLAWLESS acquisition now that you've owned it a few months any surprises as far in what you're seeing in the business?","Rick Dierker","Yeah. Only good surprises. Really it's a terrific business. We expected 15-plus percent sales growth and we should easily exceed that target in 2019.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Rick Dierker","All right, Rupesh.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Cody Ross","Hi. Good morning everyone. This is actually Cody on for Jason this morning. Thank you for taking our questions. Just want to stick on FLAWLESS for a little bit. On our math FLAWLESS boosted net sales by $7.4 million in the quarter, but was only there for about two months suggesting its full quarter sales were approximately $10 million. This came in below our expectations. How does this compare with the performance a year ago and relative to your expectations? And also what's the normal seasonality for this business?","Matt Farrell","Remember we didn't own it a year ago, number one. Number two, we generally do not comment on specific brand sales or factor sales within a quarter. I can tell you that they hit on number that we expected in Q2. We're very optimistic about full year as they continue to gain more traditional retail distribution.","Rick Dierker","The only thing I would add is there's a little bit of seasonality in the business, it's probably a little bit stronger in the back half of the year, but like Matt said it hit the numbers that we are expecting right on. And we think there's a lot of the momentum behind that business.","Cody Ross","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. And then also just as far as the stock buybacks, you didn't buy any stock this quarter. Last year you only repurchased stock in the first quarter of 2018, as you dealt with integrating acquisitions. You still have roughly $400 million in authorization and your leverage stands at just two times. How should we think about capital allocation priorities for the balance of the year? Thank you.","Matt Farrell","Yeah. Well back when we announced the acquisition for FLAWLESS, we've said, number one, capital allocation priority is M&A far and away, right? And that's what we've been doing, that's what we're going to continue to do. And at that time we said we would not do all the buyback that we previously thought we might do. So we are effectively done with the buyback for this year, as we continue to manage our debt EBITDA ratios just have dry powder for future acquisitions.","Cody Ross","Thank you very much. Congrats on the great quarter. I'll pass it.","Matt Farrell","Thank you, Cody.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Steve Powers","Thanks. Good morning. Look, I guess the question for me, just to start is, if you step back and with across the peer set, this is a bit a good quarter and a good year more or less across the board. Not to take any from your results, I mean your results have been great and your outlook seems upbeat and that's fantastic.","But I guess, as you step back the question for me is, why do you think this is the year that things are finally falling to place across the industry after years of big brands struggling to get price protect margin and fend off competition? Are there specific drivers that you would call out? And do you see it as sustainable, or is this just a sweet spot we're going through here?","Matt Farrell","Well, you got to keep in mind that there has been a lot of price increases across many, many categories in CPG. And I think, there was probably a lot of fear for many years as to whether or not the prices actually could be raised and that they would stick. And so, consequently they have.","And I think that's been maybe a surprise to maybe a lot of investor\u2019s, maybe it's a surprise to some CPG companies. We certainly haven't raised prices in years. But the fact that the companies have raised prices, what it does suggest is that maybe we won't wait as long next time before the next round of price increases happen, as long as their costs are justified.","But I don't have any magical answers as to why it kind of worked this year. I think one thing that helps is that the economy is strong. When you got a strong consumer that's the time to do it. We\u2019d have a far different result, I expect if we were in a much weaker economy.","Steve Powers","Yes. Okay. And so I guess to follow on to that is, as you look out over the next couple of quarters maybe two questions on the makeup of organic growth. I guess, in the quarter, do you have a sense for how much of the price mix that you're seeing right now is, pure price versus more trade-up and mix?","And as you look out over the next couple of quarters, how do you expect those drivers to put the balance of price versus volume and mix to shake out and maybe rebalance a bit?","Matt Farrell","Yes. Thanks for the questions Steve. Price mix like we said for the company it was 4.8%, that's largely price, right? I mean that's -- with only parse of that between price and mix, but largely price.","And like I said previously, maybe to Rupesh, we believe that trend to continue for the balance of the year. And for Q2 for domestic, it looks very positive 5.9% for price\/mix and volume was down almost a point. And so we think that trend's going to continue as well. And we'll lap that early next year.","Steve Powers","Okay. If I could squeeze in one more specific to litter, the trends there seemed -- sorry? Okay. So just on litter, the trends there seemed still broadly positive. I guess just in the syndicated data, you\u2019re starting to see some deceleration and some share trend degradation there with Nestl\u00e9 and private label or the beneficiaries. Is there anything that you would call in that category that is shifting that you're on watch for?","Matt Farrell","Yes. I got a comment maybe Rick want to chime in too. But if you look at the category in the second quarter it grew 8.9%. And ARM & HAMMER cat litter grew 10.4%. So our share was up 30 bps in the second quarter to 23.4%. So we're the number two cat litter right now.","And within -- the category isn't that promotional. I mean the category actually reduced shelf sold on deal by 50 basis points year-over-year. It is true the private label picked up 90 bps in the quarter to 10.8%. So there's definitely some strength in private label. But historically private label has been around 9% to 11% of the category. So I wouldn't say that that would necessarily be alarming private label at 10.8%.","Rick Dierker","Yes. And I would just add Steve. You should expect our litter business to slow a little bit in the second half. Remember the competition raised price earlier than we did, so we've got a little bit of volume benefit early in the second half. So, on a stack basis we're still strong, but it's just, we're comping higher volume growth number.","Steve Powers","Yes. Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from -- will come from the line of Steve Strycula from UBS. You may begin.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning. So really solid quarter on organic sales throughout the consumer business, how do we think about 3Q in the back half? Why does it step down a little bit lower the two-year stacks aren't materially different? That would be the first part of my question. Is there anything sequentially decelerating?","Rick Dierker","No, not really. We talked about it. The two-year stack is a little different, right? The first half of this year is about 4.7% at the average that implies a 3.2% in the back half which is down 150 basis points. So 50 bps was just because the second half of 2018 was so strong 4.5% versus 4% in the first half of 2018. So 50 bps of 150 is really just comps. And then the other 100 bps is what we've been talking about Matt went through it in detail just lower promotional spending in general both trade and couponing.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And then Rick in the past quarters you've given us a nice like put and take for the various gross margin components. Would you mind kind of just rattling that off really quickly for us?","Rick Dierker","Yeah. No problem. So for the quarter right we're up 30 basis points. Price volume mix was really strong plus 230 basis points, productivity again strong plus 130 basis points, acquisition impact plus 40 basis points, and then inflation minus 370 basis points. That inflation number includes commodities, it includes other manufacturing, and it includes tariffs, it includes the fact that we have a prior year one-time benefit with the change in accounting and other stuff. So a lot in that number but that's the detail.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And to close out, Matt a strategic question for you. On Specialty Products, I know it's has performed maybe the way you'd like year \u2013to-date. But taking the long-term view why is this a synergistic business with your consumer arm which is really doing quite well right now? How integrated is it into your core operations? And why is it core for the long term? Thanks.","Matt Farrell","Yeah. It's integrated into our core operations, because we have centralized our supply chain meaning that baking soda that's produced by our plants it has a destination of going to the consumer side of the business or to the specialty chemical side of the business where you have that bulk sodium bicarbonate. So it is fully integrated. We're doing separate plants for each of the businesses. The reason why we like this business long term is number one is these products are labeled ARM & HAMMER. And ARM & HAMMER has a fabulous name within the animal productivity industry particularly in dairy.","And one of the things I mentioned in my remarks, upfront is that, if you look at the animal productivity, business which represents two-thirds of Specialty Product, the non-dairy business is growing double digits this year. And those are the businesses that we acquired over the past few years. We bought VI-COR Agro BioSciences and then Passport. So we think long-term the dairy side of the business is going to be less significant to us. Non-dairy is going to grow and it's got a nice challenge because of population growth. And the short story is demand for proteins going to grow over the next 20 30 years because population is going to grow from seven billion to nine billion and you got to feed people. So I think being cattle swine and poultry is a good move for the company. So, long-term we feel good about it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. You may begin.","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning.","Matt Farrell","Hey, Joe.","Joe Altobello","So first question on personal care. Sales do continue be sluggish. I think it's more of the same really some of which seems to structural in some of your categories, but it was below what we were expecting despite having FLAWLESS for a portion of the quarter. So what do you think it turnaround some of these personal care categories that has been slow to really respond?","Matt Farrell","Yeah. You got to look at what's in the numbers. WATERPIK and BATISTE obviously are good growers for us. And then FLAWLESS is going to be another one. So that's going to help our overall numbers going forward, definitely as you point out, have some structural issues for example in condoms, the condom category, kids category declining birth rates alternatives for contraception beyond condoms being IUDs diaphragms Plan B. Then, we have a couple of other categories that are struggling for L'IL CRITTERS for example, which is a children's gummy vitamins struggle because of just intense competition lot of competition in there. And then in SPINBRUSH, again the SPINBRUSH had some struggles as well. We have a new entrant in that called quip, which is someone we're going to have to be dealing with. So yeah, you have a lot of the brands and maybe only growing small single digits or declining low-single digits, because we have a lot of brands in there. But they all add up so this quarter personal care was up 1%.","Rick Dierker","And I would just add on to that Joe, its Rick. I would say that 1% was maybe depressed a little bit, right? We had some price increases that got announced early in the year. And so whether it's TROJAN or ORAJEL, some retailers did buy in a couple of weeks into Q1. So, Q2 looks a little bit lower. But by and large I think we've met sort of our expectation.","Joe Altobello","Got it. Okay. And just secondly you guys have mentioned this earlier, but we do seem to be in unchartered territory in some of these categories, particularly, on the wholesale side or on the household side on pricing at promo levels, this has now been an industry that has always been disciplined on promotion to say the least. I understand it's early, but it seems like you guys are thinking about 2020 promo level to look a lot like what they're looking like in 2019 at this point.","Matt Farrell","No, we're really looking at a couple of quarters ahead Joe. So, we haven't made any commentary on what we expect to happen in the future. But considering only how hard people are fighting to increase their profits year-over-year. I don't expect that that's going to turn around at least in the next six months.","Joe Altobello","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning. I actually have a question on your marketing expense in the quarter. I'd like to hear more about why the lower spend happened in Q2 and actually Q1 was below as well. You guys did touch on this, but did this in any way suggests your pipeline of innovation was delayed?","Also based on your full year guidance, which I think is for flat marketing spend as a percentage of sales, it suggests your second half spend will really need to ramp by maybe be as much as 16% to about 12.5% as a percentage of sales and that would be up from about I guess under 11% in the first half. So, I just really wanted to understand if that is realistic. Thanks.","Rick Dierker","Yes, thanks Bonnie. Just to give you some color on Q2, right? We said Q2 marketing spend was down 130 basis points. Part of that was just the FLAWLESS accounting impact. If you strip out the FLAWLESS impact, right, it is just going to net sales and their dollar spend in marketing happening in the marketing line. That was worth 30 bps. So, really down 100. I'd say we expected to be down 100, right? We knew that the retail reset shifted for litter and for additives as an example in the back half of the year.","So, we didn't go into the detail in our outlook by quarter and we don't really intend to do that. I would just tell you to give you some confidence that yes marketing's supposed to be up pretty big in the back half probably up 30 or 40 bps in the third quarter and the balance will be in the fourth quarter.","Matt Farrell","Yes. And just something to add to that. We got a couple of our new products the resets are happening for some major retailers in the second half. They would be OxiClean Dark Protect and also Cloud Control which is a cat litter. So, right now we have a low ACV, so we're not going to turn on the advertising towards second half.","Bonnie Herzog","And then maybe on the same topic, looking forward, do you expect your spend or marketing spend level to stay kind of where they've been trending? They've been inching up over the years. Is that how we should think about this over the medium and long-term?","Rick Dierker","We've said right where we're at this range whether it's 11.7, 11.5, 11.9 this range has been really good for us, right? And you could see that in the share results, you can see that in the category growth results. So, we think we're in a sweet spot.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. And then if I may just wanted to circle back to something you mentioned which is M&A. You briefly touched on it. So, I was hoping you guys could give us a sense as to how strong your appetite is right now for acquisition, especially after you just completed the FLAWLESS acquisition.","And then you mentioned you're kind of building the dry powder. So, do you have enough? And how do you view the current competitive environment for M&A?","Matt Farrell","Yes. Well, look we are in acquisition platform over serial acquirer and we continue to be active despite the FLAWLESS acquisition. Rick can take you through what our leverage ratio is right now. And acquisition is the number one destination for our cash flow. And as many of you know we have a very disciplined process. We have acquisition criteria and we will step up for opportunities that meet our criteria. Just to kind of illustrate how important this is for our business model, we've done 18 acquisitions since the year 2000. So, we actually have no restraints right now with respect to doing our next acquisition. But Rick can chime in on that.","Rick Dierker","Yes, I mean our leverage ratio is going to be sub two times by the end of 2019. So, plenty of room. I think the way we struck the FLAWLESS deal, did nothing but help that. And as Matt said we are busy looking for the next deal.","Bonnie Herzog","What's the environment like right now you guys? Has it changed dramatically since last year for instance?","Matt Farrell","I think the best way to respond to that is that generally anything that's for sale, particularly in the U.S. where we are aware of. And that's simply because we're regarded as a buyer. So a lot of people like to get us in the process. But I would say, it's no different than it was a year ago.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust. You may begin.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning.","Matt Farrell","Hey, Bill.","Bill Chappell","Just to follow up on a couple of your comments. On innovation pipeline being delayed, maybe give some ideas of where that was? And where you would expect to kind of a lift in terms of products and as we move to the second half from those innovations?","Rick Dierker","Yes. No I've mentioned there was OXICLEAN dark protect, so that's the - our new additive for dark clothing. And the other one is CLUMP & SEAL CLOUD CONTROL, which is a cat litter. So those are the two where we have low ACV right now, low distribution. And we expect with some of the major resets in the second half, that's going to pick up quite a bit.","Bill Chappell","And is it safe to say that the cat litter would be the bigger of the innovations where you see more marketing dollars? I mean, OXI seems a little bit smaller?","Matt Thomas","Yes, I think, that's fair, to be more -- litter has been bigger for us, right?","Bill Chappell","And then, what are you seeing in terms of the outlook? It seems that you and your competitors are all benefiting from pricing and not a lot of it being dealt back. Is the expectation -- can there be another round of the pricing, as we move into 2020? Are you starting to see some deal backs as we move into the fall, or is it -- it seems much more rational than it's been in years past.","Rick Dierker","Yes. I think you got to remind -- everybody's got to remind, so it's only been four or less quarters of higher prices. So it's something like we've been living under this now new price umbrella. And remember all those price increases were cost justified. So, I do think, at some time in the future I think that the muscle that was really maybe atrophied or dormant for many years for CPG companies maybe now, who has just sprung to life. So people may be more likely to go forward with cost justified price increases. But I think the requirement is still there for cost justification. Without that, you won't have price increases.","Matt Thomas","And remember you can't go to retailers and say, this is what the forecast says, first is the commodity, because is what happened. Right? So even if that same prices are expect to go up 20% in 2020, you got to wait till that actually happens to have that conversation.","Bill Chappell","Got it. And just any further thoughts. I know that, on laundry, there's certainly a lot of conversation about P&G. But in terms of the other competitor trying to get the Henkel's comments of trying to be more aggressive. If you're seeing that more at the high-end on Brazil, or if that's -- if you feel like that might be more on the low-end Sun and mid-tier type priced products?","Matt Thomas","Well, if you just look at Q2 as an indication, I guess, I said earlier that value section both Tide Simply, Purex and Sun rolled down, sold on deals year-over-year. The same is true for Persil. So we pulled back on sold on deal coupon or might have transferred over there. But that's would suggest that there's been pull-back on price. The other side of the coin is that, at least Purex came back into the market with unit dose this year, having been absent for many years. So much rather see people compete on innovation and that would be a good example of it.","Bill Chappell","Got it Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America. You may begin.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thank you. I was wondering since you're with the team at WATERPIK, if you could provide a bit more color on that business. Just sort of opportunity ahead, beyond just higher penetration of consumer, your potential to expand into other adjacent categories as well with that brand. Thanks.","Matt Thomas","Yes. WATERPIK is a wonderful business. This business has been around since the 1960s. And the people out here, there's 190 people up in Fort Collins Colorado, are experts in water-jet technology. So they invented the WATERPIK. In fact, back in the '60s, it's kind of a fun fact, Lyndon Johnson [ph] gave WATERPIK as a -- to the foreign dignitaries as a sign of American ingenuity and innovation. So a fun fact for you, Olivia.","But this is a business that really started to take off three years ago; maybe four years ago, as a result of instituting a bunch of learn program and really communicating to dentists and hygienists in the United States about the benefits of WATERPIK it then turnaround and recommended it to consumers. So there's a lot of runway ahead for this business.","If you look at battery-operated toothbrush say what's the household penetration in the 40s, 40% would have powered toothbrushes. And water flosses are more in the low-20s. So we see there's a lot of opportunity if that were what we're going to be shooting for. A lot of opportunity to grow in the U.S. And then outside the U.S. is really the big opportunity. International is only 20% of the business today. There's no reason why the international business should far exceed the size of the U.S. business.","So we just think focusing on water flosses and that opportunity had with all the science that's behind these water flosses and the greater interest now in gum health. And you even see that in the toothpaste category, both Crest and Colgate have products that are directed towards gum health and toothpaste. So I don't think there's no need really right now to say we're going to be branching into other categories. We want to nail the opportunity that we have in front of us.","Olivia Tong","Got it. That's helpful. Maybe if you could talk a bit about the whole portfolio. The spread and growth between household and personal care in consumer house line pretty dramatically this year. Obviously, the pricing is proportionately better in household. But what's your view on the go forward? And while we talk a lot about M&A with you guys, what about the other side? How often do you do a portfolio review and assess the brand and their contribution to the total company?","Rick Dierker","Olivia, this is Rick. I would just say that as we pull back more on our household business, you're going to see the gap narrow between household and personal care growth it should be more balanced in the back half of the year.","Matt Farrell","Yes. And longer term Olivia it is true that household has been around a lot longer and bigger than our personal care business. We've -- a lot of our acquisitions have been on the personal care side over time. But we're optimistic about our ability to grow on long term. We -- our algorithm is that we grow top line 3%; bottom line 8%. And we think we have the portfolio that can do that. So we don't have a lot of flash, but we're steady as a company. So people invest in the company can't bet that we're going to hit those numbers year after year after year with the portfolio that we have. And we are going to continue to add to it. And we have 12 brands today to make up 80% of our revenues and profits. And 12 today, 20 tomorrow. We have such cash, which is a flywheel, so we can continue to add good brands to the portfolio.","Olivia Tong","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. You may begin.","Andrea Teixeira","Thanks, good morning. So my question is on the organic sales growth bridge. Given that you had the 5% growth in the second quarter, why are you expecting a deceleration has occurred? And related to that, we have heard from some of your competitors calling about 50 bps of pull forward of inventory because of the one-day delivery. And just to match the service levels online. So in particular, if you continue to grow faster in e-commerce as we saw we heard you say 27, 28, did you call in a similar impact that you had in the quarter for your 5%, 4.9% to be precise and you're banking into that as a slow down?","And you can also -- can you also please update on the international also kind of showing a sequential deceleration, but obviously it's still above your long-term algorithm? And if I can squeeze a little bit on Rick's commentary just a follow-up on gross margin. You said about 350 basis points inflation on the COGS. But if you're saying like obviously the commodity outlook is better, but you have the hedges so are you seeing that starting to benefit you in the fourth quarter, or just next year? Thank you.","Rick Dierker","Okay, Andrea. I'm going to do my best. It's a long list. So we're getting sales growth deceleration from the first half, second half I already touched on that. It was 4.7% in the first half. 3.2% is the implied number for the back half, 4% for the full year. It's down 150 basis points. 50 bps because of kind of the stack of the comp first half of 2018 was 4% growth and it was 4.5% in the second half of 2018. Another 100 basis points as well as promotional spending both trade and couponing. We did not call out anything on retail inventory relative to e-commerce. We never call out anything about retail or inventory. I would tell you if anything we could have gone the other way and said there's a little bit of pre-buy in Q1 for condoms. And so that impacted us negatively in Q2. But by and large that's you're right e-commerce is going to one-day shipping, there's a small impact maybe, but we would never call that out or call it material.","Number three is international. Again, you're saying there is a deceleration. I would tell you maybe a slight deceleration, but again we just raised our outlook for the full year to 7.5%, right? So I think it's on the margin, I think those guys have proven time and time again that they're delivering in excess of the evergreen model, or outlook that we have for that business.","And then the fourth one was commodities. The fourth one I think you're right. I said in Q2 that, there was about 370 basis points of inflation\/manufacturing cost increases. We that's a big bucket in there, there's a big bucket of commodities, but there's also a big bucket of tariffs and really not having some prior year one-time benefit. There's also incentive comp in that number and labor increases. But as we move through the year, if we were up 20 basis points in Q1, up 30 basis points in gross margin in Q2, it implies that we're going to be up 135 basis points in the second half. That means, we're going to accelerate from where we're at 500 basis points and it's largely, because commodities are coming down, but other manufacturing costs are coming down as well. So I hope that gives you a little bit more clarity.","Andrea Teixeira","No. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel. You maybe begin.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask your expectations for the material increase in marketing spend in the back half of the year. I don't want to get into guidance or thought on next year, but directionally when you've done this historically how do you think about kind of the flow through impact to the business? It certainly seems like given innovation cadence given spend that there's going to be some kind of benefits maybe just directionally without looking at any specific number for guidance. Is there any way to kind of think about things as we head into the first half of next year?","Matt Farrell","Yeah. We have an evergreen business model as you know, and so I've mentioned that earlier in response to Olivia. I mean organic growth of 3% and earnings per share growth of 8%. And that said we're going to get 25 basis points of gross margin expansion annually. But generally, the marketing is not a contributor to the operating margin expansion on long term. We generally, as Rick said earlier, we are around 11.7, 11.5, 11.9. We're in kind of a sweet spot.","So if someone were to ask us, what do you think your marketing spend as a percentage it's always going to be next year, the year after, the year after that? We'd say, it probably between 11.5% and 12%. That's been working for us.","As far as where we put the money? We got a lot of choices. We got -- we're in lots of categories and we have 12 power brands. So we are always focused on brand health. And one of the things I don't know Rick or I mentioned it, but we said that we do have more flexibility in the second half. We do intend to reinvest not just in marketing brand health, but also in R&D, for innovation. So lots of areas to go, marketing, R&D, analytics, automation, sustainability even cybersecurity.","So we've got lots of places we'd like to put more money in the second half of the year, should that materialize. But -- we have -- I made reference to the fact, we're going to exceed our evergreen business model this year and that's important too. That's how, we drive the company long-term, how we drive total shareholder return?","Mark Astrachan","Yes, I guess, I was more thinking about the impact on revenue growth, just in terms of how the flow through the market -- incremental marketing spend would look. So, maybe if you have any sort of color on that?","Then I just wanted to ask an unrelated question on international, just trying to figure out how the new market and distribution especially in Southeast Asia, China have gone so far. Maybe if you could talk a bit about brand acceptance kind of what you've seen so far in brands that are gaining most traction or have the distribution sign the product? That would be helpful.","Rick Dierker","Yes just a one liner on the marketing spend. When we spend incremental marketing, it just bulletproofs our evergreen model. So we hit or hopefully beat our evegreen model for organic revenue because of the incremental investments on marketing, yes that's what we hope for and potentially that's what we expect.","Matt Farrell","Yes. As far as the China and Southeast Asia, we're off to a really good start with Shanghai, Jahwa. That's a CPG company public company that we signed on with a year ago. And the categories that we entered China with are baking soda, toothpaste dry shampoo and -- some hygiene. By and large the acceptance is good.","Two call outs in particular in Southeast Asia and also in China that would be water flossers and gummy vitamins. So they seem to be really a hit with the Chinese and the Southeast Asian consumer. So I think the strategy is working. We got -- I think China and Southeast Asia can be a big part of our story going forward.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Matt for closing remarks.","Matt Farrell","Okay. All right folks. So we had a terrific quarter and looking forward to talking to everybody at the end of the third quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"4599":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) Q4 2017 Earnings Call February  5, 2018 12:30 PM ET","Executives","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Steven P.

LLC","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, everybody. It is game time. And I want to thank everybody for coming today. Have lots of familiar faces in the crowd. We had a terrific fourth quarter and concluded another solid year at Church & Dwight. And our call for next year is 16% to 18% EPS growth. This is tops among CPG and it reflects the efforts of our employees as well as the team that's here today, we're going to have the whole management team up here at the end of the show.","There have been mixed results of late in CPG, as you all know. And before we get into the formal program, I'd like to spend a few minutes recapping why we are a standout among CPG. So, we have a portfolio of brands that consumers love, and we have employees who are committed to making those brands successful. We have an evergreen model, which leads to consistency and a financially literate company. We are lean, we like to keep it simple, and this enables two things, it's speed and our ability to adapt the change.","I'm sure many of you heard us say in the past that we think change is our friend. And if you look at our portfolio, you get a little more granular. You'll see that we have a lower exposure to private label than most of the CPG companies. And we also have a lower exposure to promotional categories.","And finally, we make really good choices when it comes to acquisitions, and that results in us riding waves. And those waves include dry shampoo for example, gummy vitamins, hair thinning, gum health and you'll hear a little bit more today about alternatives to antibiotics. And these are the reasons why we expect to continue as a standout in CPG. And if you were investing in the consumer space, there's no better place to invest than Church & Dwight.","So, now I want to get into the formal part of the program. First is the Safe Harbor Act or Statement, I encourage everybody to read it. There is the agenda. So, I've a one page short story. I'm going to run through who we are, state of the business, and what innovation we have coming in 2018. Then we have three members at the management team come up, talk about our digital capabilities, our continuing great story in International, and also, educational part of the program today is our animal productivity story, which is a fabulous story. And then we'd come back up, talk about how we run the company, and Rick's going to wrap it up with the financials.","Okay, short story. So, I hit a few of these upfront, solid year. We have a lot of confidence in 2018 and beyond. Terrific results, all three segments are healthy. And you see on the far right side, we're going to cover those three points later on today.","All right. Who we are? So, we are a company with 11 power brands. Those 11 power brands drive 80% of our revenues and profits. All of our efforts are concentrated around those brands. And we have a balanced portfolio between household and personal care brands and we have a thriving specialty products business.","We also have a nice balance between premium and value products 60%-40%. And now, we're a small company, so we operate in the land of the giants, but that helps us. We are a very nimble organization. So, the three things that enables us to do. We make quick decisions and not a lot of bureaucracy in our company, easy communication, and our ability to adapt.","And we have a long history of growth through acquisitions. You can see $1.5 billion in 2004, $4 billion we will cross in 2018, and 10 of those 11 brands that I talked about, they were all acquired since the year 2000.","So, we are regarded as an acquisition platform. So, we're a company that can buy a brand, help that brand to grow, bring some ideas and some operational efficiencies to the business, and we have a terrific track record with acquiring businesses, large and small. And we have access to capital, so we continue to do that. And we're very fussy about what we buy. So, this criteria, many of you, and particularly our long-term holders know this very well; so we buy number one or number two brands, high-growth, high-margin, they need to be asset-light.","If you go all the way over to the right, this is the way you can ride a wave. You got to make sure you have a sustainable competitive advantage from the business that you're buying. And in 2017, we bought our 11th power brand, Waterpik. So, number one power flosser and number one shower-head replacement. So, if there's one thing to remember, we're a company with 11 power brands today, we're looking for 20 tomorrow.","So now, state of the business, which is terrific. So, you all saw this in the release this morning, Q4 up 3.4% organically, double-digit EPS growth, and a great quarter for cash. All three businesses are healthy, that's Domestic, International and Specialty Products, all growing. And here is our report card. So we're pretty transparent about how we're doing with shares, show this to you every year. Seven out of our 11 power brands grew share in 2017, so terrific result.","And if you look at measured channels and non-measured channels, look at category growth, so the Nielsen, the measured channels, we would say account for 1.7% of our all-in category growth. But because non-measured channels are growing double-digit, that adds another point to what we would say is our all-in category growth. So, we would say the categories that we're in on a weighted average basis are growing. And that's a nice tailwind for us.","I mentioned earlier that we have low exposure to private label. You can see five out of our 14 categories have private label exposure, but generally they're very stable, not growing.","Now, innovation, always a good story for us. So, SLIDE was a fabulous new product launch for us in 2017. So, we're going to build on that in 2018. Also in 2018, for Clump & Seal lightweight, we're coming out with an unscented variant, this unscented is growing.","In detergent, Odor is the new stain. So, we're taking our Odor Blasters concept and we're moving it across all of our variants in fabric care.","Next up is gummy probiotics. You know us as a gummy vitamin company, we're moving into gummy probiotics in 2018.","First Response pregnancy kits, so if you're a hopeful positive, you're going to check once, you're going to double check, you're going to triple check. So, this product is doing extremely well, we just launched it. And Batiste is a juggernaut for the company, continues to grow. Not only has our share grown, but the category has been a rocket ship for several years now. And why? Because, 80% of women do not wash their hair every day.","Waterpik's got a couple of new products coming out. This is a really good one, convenience of whitening while flossing. And then if you have a dog, you know what's like to wrestle a dog in a tub. So, we have a Waterpik Pet Wand Pro. I encourage everybody to get this if you have an animal, because it makes shampooing your pets a lot easier.","All right now, I'm going to bring up Britta, Britta Bomhard has been with our company for 4.5 years. She ran our European business for 2.5 years. In January of 2016, she came over and became our Chief Marketing Officer. So, she's going to have some fun with you now, and update you on our digital capabilities.","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Happy Monday, everyone and particularly Eagles' fans. So, I'm going to talk a little bit about the digital capabilities we're building. And I thought I'd start by grounding ourselves. So, first of all, in 2015, 1% of our sales was online. In 2016, we doubled that to 2%. And as you can see, in 2017, we really accelerated and now 5% of Church & Dwight sales are online, which from all the information I have, puts us in the top scale of our peer group. So, you might wonder what have we done, how did we get there? So, how did we accelerate?","First is, we are and invest where the consumer is. Secondly, we have a growing expertise in digital attribution models. And thirdly, we are developing our DTC skills. I'm going to take you through each of these topics one by one so you understand more what we're working on.","So, first of all, how long do you think U.S. consumers spend online? Five and a half hours. So, a lot of you might think that's not me. But, if you total up your phone usage, your computer usage, watching Netflix or being on the game console, that makes five and a half hours on average every day.","So, what's important for us? We have to be where the consumer is. And what do the consumers do when they're online? So, first of all, they want to be entertained. Secondly, they're looking for products, they're searching for product information, and then they shop. So, what we've done very deliberately is resource allocation. So, now more than 35% of our advertising spend is digital. We make sure that every single one of our products has a great review and we're aiming, and the majority already has a 4.5 or above rating. And we've spend a lot of effort to bring more than 1,000 product pages to life, so that when consumers are online, they get great information about our products.","So, we are number one, for example, on Amazon, for baking soda, Trojan, First Response, Batiste. That shouldn't be surprising, because we're number one for those products also in bricks and mortar. But we're actually also number one on cat litter, which is much better than our bricks and mortar performance. And then we have brands where actually the consumer online matches so well with our target group and where we work hand in hand and partner. We've great campaigns like the New Year, New Me campaign and we get extraordinary results. So, in Vitafusion, our market share in the gummy category is more than 50% in Amazon; sets us apart from all our competitors.","So, online presents a great opportunity for us. 24\/7 the consumer can get our products. And let me illustrate that with a little example. If you have a health and hygiene problem, you probably don't want to be seen going into store and some hygiene products are not readily available, not all retailers have it, whereas if you go online, that category is fully there. So, great opportunity for us to get full distribution on all our products.","Secondly, we learn a lot about the consumer in their online journey. You get great consumer insights, and also with that insights, you can develop better targeting, better messaging, and with that, better results.","Why should you believe me? We're actually at the point where we do predictive modeling, that's the lovely black box, and we've seen in the first couple of brands that we get sales improvement of up 12% versus last year. So, I'm sure you would love to know what's in our black box; obviously, I can't tell you. But I will take you through the part that's visible.","So, coming back to the Super Bowl and our competitors, and you might have seen ads about clean clothes or about one type of stain, which was I think avocado. Let me talk you through how we as the leader in stain management are actually targeting. Stains are much more complicated than you think. So, now during Super Bowl time, you might have pizza stains, so you might have wet stains or whatever was on your Super Bowl menu. But when it comes to maybe March, April, better weather, you're going to actually have grass stains or dirt stains. During the course of the year, different stains become more prevalent, and then actually there are different type of person. So, some people here in that room know how annoying these makeup stains are and some people in this room don't care about makeup stains at all. And if you've been a new parent you know that for once spinach stains and carrot stains start to dominate your life, things you've never dealt with before. So, stains vary by the season, by the type of person you are and by your life stage.","So, let me see what I can show you on one stain, what we do with that, which hopefully applies to lots of people here, red wine \u2013 and it went dark, sorry. So, we have with Dear OxiClean, a great campaign which can target every single type of stain and because the product has such a great performance, consumers actually write to us and share their successes and we turn that around into campaigns for our consumers. So, let's have one of our campaigns.","[Video Presentation] (00:13:38-00:14:31).","So, you're seeing a real consumer story, we've shared back. We equally have most people who discovered that OxiClean is fantastically cleaning your boat or baseball stains and so on, so on. And in the digital world, you can even do hyper-targeting. So, we are able to target people who used to buy bleach and no longer buying bleach because they're dissatisfied; so, lapsed bleach users.","And here I have another campaign for you. So, this is actually digital online, and as you know, lots of people watch it while they're supposed to be working. So, this is silence, so your boss doesn't discover that you're online instead of working on that presentation.","So, another great example of how we really target the pain points of consumers, and what has that produced? It has produced two great results for us. First of all, the category which has been down in the past is back to growth. So, stain fighting for long time now is invigorating and growing again. And secondly, we now have over 50% market share in that category, which is our all-time high. So, Dear OxiClean, thank you.","Now that I've talked a little bit about this, I wanted to move on to the next topic which was our direct-to-consumer. Direct-to-consumer is a marketeer's dream, because what I just talked about and we have the acquisition of Toppik and Viviscal, which helped us build that capability. Why is it marketeer's dream? Because here there is no broken link in the data. So, if you sell in bricks-and-mortar or even to Amazon, you cannot follow one person from start to finish, whereas in direct-to-consumer you can. That means we're not only able to see which campaign got how many people to buy, but we can also see how often did they repurchase and how many years did they keep repurchasing. And that gives you such a wealth of data, it's just so exciting. We can try campaign A versus campaign B. We can actually try medium A versus medium B, and we can see all the way what it does to lifetime value of a consumer. So, lot of fun, great stuff, great learnings.","And then, we have also I think learned a lot about digital advertising and how it works. As I said earlier, it's all about entertainment. And one of the things in part was all about features and benefits. So that's no longer the case. So, we are now much more about emotion and humor, and I know I probably have found a great targeting category for all of you, because you all every day think about bathroom cleaning. I know you can't wait to learn features and benefits. So let's see our latest campaign for Kaboom.","[Video Presentation] (17:32-18:43)","So, if you want to have an oddly satisfying moments, there are Kaboom cans on your tables, we can fight over them. So, I can only say we think the future is bright for Church & Dwight in online; we are number one on online market shares. We're getting a growing expertise in attribution modeling. We are having great and growing DTC skills and I think we're becoming more skilled in connecting to consumers. And with all of that, we're having a lot of fun. So, I think we are only at the beginning of a great journey of using digital to its fullest.","And with that, I would like to introduce Steve Cugine, who is our Head of International. He is actually the composer of our international strategy, the conduct of a fantastic international team, and I'm sure his presentation will be music to your ears. Steve?","Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Britta, thank you very much. So, I'm excited to be here today to share the international story. I am very excited about the Eagles winning. It's been a long, long time, and so two things to celebrate today. But I wanted to first ground us in where our subsidiaries are located outside of the United States. So we have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada and Mexico, Brazil, the UK, France, Australia, and effective January 1 of this year, Germany, capitalizing on our strong growth in that country.","The international business has been a historic grower for the company, very consistent, performing at the high-end of our Evergreen range. But in 2013, Adrian Huns, the former President of the division, was retiring. And I had a passionate belief that the international business represented a growth engine for the company that was yet untapped, and the management team also felt the same way. So they asked me to come in and develop a new strategic plan for the international business. We began to implement that new strategic plan in 2014.","Q1 of 2014, we had 0% organic growth. By Q4 of 2014, we hit 7.4% and frankly never looked back. What I'd like to do is now establish a new Evergreen target for the international at 6%. And we're confident that we're going to be able to deliver that organic growth moving into the future, and I'll tell you why. But first let me unpack the box of our international strategy a bit for you today.","First, we differentiated developed markets versus emerging markets. We said that these markets are unique, the consumers in those markets need certain brands that are highly differentiated, and our go-to-market strategies are much different. So, we identified and focused on these six brands across North America, Europe and Asia. So, differentiated strategy based on markets, focusing on a select few brands that will get our attention and disproportionate investment.","We did the same thing in emerging markets, to really capitalize on the expanding middle class in China and Southeast Asia, South America, Middle East and Africa. And you will see a slightly different set, smaller set for these markets. But we've seen the success of this strategy in that, our markets where we have subsidiaries, we've seen increased growth across our subsidiary markets and certainly exploding growth in our export markets.","This pie chart frames the difference between our subsidiary markets and our export markets. Our subsidiary markets represent 74% of our total and export represents 26%. Export has been growing double digits in the past and will continue to grow double digits in the future. This is also a key part of our strategic plan shift that we implemented, export used to be incorporated in \u2013 as part of the subsidiaries.","We separated this out to find it as a strategic business unit for the international business, and we run it as a separate business. So combined, we found that with that focus and these new strategies, our subsidiary markets improve their growth rates and we're able to really capitalize on a very fast growing business called export markets. And we wanted to invest behind this growth. So in 2016, we created sales and marketing headquarters in Panama, Singapore, and the UK designed to support our distributor partners in region.","I want to shift a little bit to the Asia-Pacific region. We have experienced very significant growth, so our Asia-Pac business grew 30% last year. And so we're excited about this growth and we by focusing more time and attention to this market, we expect it to deliver continued strong growth into the future. As we all know, this market is exploding. The middle class consumers are growing quite dramatically and that will continue. So we want to position ourselves for success in this market.","So, I talked about adding regional sales and marketing headquarters in many parts of the world, but Singapore is one we established in 2016. We've been increasing head count and investment in our Singapore office and in this region. As I mentioned, this region is growing 30% or has grown 30% in the past year.","In the announcement, we also talked about our new relationship with the DKSH, which is a leader, one of the leading distributors in the Southeast Asia region and Hong Kong. And we just completed training 200 of their sales reps. So we are investing this year 2018 behind increased distribution and additional marketing, so we expect very significant growth from these emerging markets.","But you can't talk about Asia Pacific without talking about China. We have a relatively small business today in China. That business doubled last year off a small base and we're really evaluating our strategic plan to really capitalize on this for the future. But, I would say, maybe the biggest news today for International and Church & Dwight is, we believe that we really have achieved critical mass.","In 2017, we finished the year with over $600 million in sales and we have \u2013 we believe between our subsidiary markets and our export markets a real global platform. And so, we're going to leverage this global platform to drive growth of our acquired businesses. These four businesses will all see very significant growth in 2018 and we believe beyond. Let me give you an example.","So, Waterpik, when we acquired this business had three people in Canada, but we have 100. They had seven people in Europe and we have 280. So, we have scale that we can really bring to these businesses, and we're excited about growing them dramatically.","So, I believe the international business is well-positioned for 6% growth moving into the future. Why, we have brands that have significant runway. For example, our ARM & HAMMER brand is our largest brand in the portfolio, and it continues to deliver strong organic growth, and we believe that is well-positioned in emerging markets to continue to grow.","Exports, as I mentioned has been growing double digits, and we expect that to continue. We're investing significantly in Southeast Asia and China ,and that will be a growth engine for us moving forward. Our acquired brands, all represent significant opportunity for growth. Last, but not least, we have some members of our international team present today, and so I'm proud to say that we've built a cadre of very strong leaders and managers that really understand their markets and are driving growth whether they'd be in our subsidiary markets or anywhere where we export our wonderful products. So, I am very confident in our ability to deliver 6% or more per year moving forward.","Well, I'd like to introduce Scott Druker. Scott is 9 years with Church & Dwight, and he is the architect of our animal nutrition business. So with that Scott, welcome.","Scott Druker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","So, when you present, you're supposed to know what your audience knows, so by show of hands, how many people know what the animal productivity business is about? Hey, more than I would have thought. So, if I accomplish nothing else, at least this video I'm about to show you, should give you a good concept of what our business is about. So, with that, if we would kick the video in.","[Video Presentation] (28:50-30:19)","So by confession, I am not a farm kid. I was born and raised \u2013 well, born in Princeton, raised in Philadelphia. So, I stand here today. I'm very proud Eagles fan. Hopefully, I won't get emotional over that.","But in addition to that actually what I am is the guy that has the best job at Church & Dwight, all arguments aside. I get to come to work every day and lead an awesome team of people that are really passionate and dedicated to help and provide safe affordable food to the world. It's a team of trained salespeople, most of which are an animal science degrees. We lead a team of vets, microbiologists, immunologists. So, it's a really just awesome, awesome group of people that are very dedicated to what they do.","So before I get into the details of the business, I thought I'd share with you three key trends that are really going on in the marketplace that are creating opportunities for our business. The first is literally the amount of resources we as a species are consuming. We are consuming our resources on this planet one-and-a-half times faster than we're replacing them. Our current population today is roughly 7.5 billion, projections have grown to close to 10 billion by 2050. So, we have some really significant challenges and opportunities when it comes to feeding a world population.","So, improving productivity is a key, and you can think of a certain ways we can deal with these challenges. One, we could control population and fortunately Church & Dwight has some products that can help on that end. We could change what we eat. You've probably seen in some popular press, some more promotion of the benefits of eating insects. I'm all for choice. I like my protein really from the traditional animals, but hey, go for it. But the real opportunity and this is the one where our business is, is really about leveraging technology to help drive productivity gains.","So, just to give you an example, I'm going to just walk you through an opportunity in the dairy market, but this story could be told whether it's swine, chicken, aquaculture. In order to feed 10 billion people consuming \u2013 in the future, consuming the same amount of dairy products that we do today, we would need to add 66 million new cows worldwide to produce enough dairy products. If we can just get the current population of dairy cows to produce a half a glass of more milk a day, we don't need to add those 66 million dairy cows around the world. So, what does that mean to us?","That means, we would be able to save the equivalent of 6,000 Empire State Buildings worth of food that's fed the cows each and every year. It would save the amount of land that needs to be used for farming to raise feed for animals, that's the size of Alaska, every single year. And we would save the amount of water each year that could supply Germany, France and Great Britain. Productivity matters, and it can really, really help improve the lives of people around the world. But it's not just about resources that's really driving and creating opportunities for our business, it's really consumer trends that's probably having the greatest short-term impact on our business.","We in this room and particularly the younger generation that's coming up has made it very loud and clear to retailers, they want their food product to be free of antibiotics, added hormones, any chemicals. And the retailers have responded. I'm sure you all have seen in the news, virtually every significant restaurant chain or supermarket chain come forward with a long-term sustainability plan and a commitment to get antibiotics out of the food.","Now, of course, that puts a lot of pressures on farmers today, who have to look at alternate ways of raising livestock. So, it's challenge to find technologies that are going to enable them still to grow healthy productive animals when some of these tools are being taken away from them.","So, what we've been as a business as the video show, we got into this business in the early 1970s, and it was anchored around feeding baking soda to dairy cows. And we really put the science behind the benefit of feeding baking soda. And for those that may wondering, it's basically Alka-Seltzer for dairy cows that helps as they eat more and become more productive, they need baking soda to help. And that's really where we anchored our business.","And then really over the decades, we really led and pioneered new innovations in feeding, mainly in dairy. We offer a product, Omega 3, Omega 6 fatty acids to help with reproduction in animals. In the early 1980s, we introduced MEGALAC, which just celebrated its 30-year anniversary, and it's still the number one bypass fat fed to cows, and the fat is fed to help them \u2013 give energy to produce more milk.","So, you could see we really, over the years, built a lot of natural solutions, fats, natural amino acids, baking soda, all anchored around that ARM & HAMMER brand that we go to market as. Then, in 2015, we had an opportunity to add prebiotics to our portfolio through the acquisition of VI-COR. It's really exciting. These products, A-MAX and CELMANAX, are yeast-based products or cell wall based products, and they're really targeted to help improve gut health in animals, to help improve health, welfare and productivity in animals.","And then, most recently, in May of last year, we acquired Agro BioSciences, which is a really exciting business, brings probiotics into our portfolio of all-natural solutions to help livestock producers grow their animals. So, I'll talk a little bit about that Agro business, because it's a really exciting business about us and really is a unique approach that we have to going about a business. So, your typical probiotic company, whether they're selling to humans or animals, has a strain or two that they've done some testing to show its benefits of killing bad bugs or helping good bugs grow, and they go to market with those one or two strains.","What we do in our business that makes us unique is we have the ability to develop a customized or bespoken \u2013 heard that one, right, bespoke, bespoke product, just learned that word last week, which is embarrassing, since I like doing crossword puzzles. But we have the ability to come in with a customized solution. So, here's where I'd give you an example. I want you to think CSI meets agriculture. So, think if you're a poultry operation and you have challenges. We have the ability to go in, sample the feed that the chickens eat, the litter that they're raised in, actually swab the chicken itself and get a full picture of the microbial diversity that's present, the good bugs, the bad bugs that are present.","We're then able to screen through our thousands and thousands of proprietary probiotic strains to find the right mixture for that operation to kill the bad bugs and help the good bugs grow. And this really now is a tool that a lot of the livestock producers, whether in dairy, aquaculture, swine, poultry, are looking for since these are really the alternatives to helping improving the animal's health as the antibiotics are being removed. So, it really ties us all together with some really natural solutions that help drive productivity gains.","So, the couple of recent acquisitions certainly brought new products into our portfolio. But one of the things that it really helped us do is become a more balanced business. If you look prior to 2015, we generated less than 1% of our revenue outside of non-dairy. We finished 2017 with more than 10% of our sales from non-dairy, and our outlook for 2018 is to continue that growth trend and see more than 15% of our sales coming from non-dairy.","The diversification isn't just across species, however. Like we've heard on the Consumer side, we've had an opportunity to grow internationally. 95% of the world population eats food outside the U.S., and we have been woefully under-represented there historically. But we've changed that over the past few years. In 2015, less than 5% of our sales were outside the U.S. and Canada. In 2017, it was greater than 10%, and our outlook for 2018 is continue growth there greater than 15%.","And as Steve pointed out, we're very confident for our outlook of continuing at 5% organic growth within our business as we look at 2018. One of the key reasons, our brand is really trusted in the marketplace. It's trusted obviously for just the recognition on the Consumer side, but we're recognized as a science leader in our industry. Probably the most important thing that gives us a lot of optimism and excitement is our product portfolio, as Matt alluded to, about riding a wave. We are riding a wave. We have the right product portfolio to capture a lot of the opportunities there with our natural solutions, whether they're the probiotics or the yeast-based products, to meet the needs of consumers.","Clearly, our new products as well as some of our traditional portfolio has opportunities across species, and as I showed earlier, we started that and we're going to continue that pace getting into global markets and global species. And that actually wraps it up as well. On the International side, we sell product now in over 70-plus countries. We have an excellent team of people internationally to help drive sales for our business. So, the future is very bright and we're very excited. So, hopefully, I accomplished one thing and you know a little bit more about our business today.","So, with that, Rick, I believe \u2013 oh, Matt, you're up. I probably should have known that.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right. Okay. That was Animal Productivity 101 for everybody today. It felt like the Discovery Channel a little bit. All right, I'm going to spend a few minutes on how we run the company, before we get Rick up here and talk about the financials. So, just a few words. So, we have four operating principles. One is we have number one brands and we've leveraged those brands. Those are the 11 power brands that are 80% of our revenues and profits. Number two, we're an asset-light company. We're very focused on the relationship of cash earnings to our tangible assets.","Third thing is people. We have fabulous people in our company. You've seen some of them present here today. We have a lot of passion for the company, for the brands, and you can't manufacture that, you can only feel it. So, if you take those three things, leverage brands, assets and people, you get good results. But then, on top of that, the company has a competency to target and acquire businesses. We've been doing it since 2001. We're 16 years in. We know how to do it. And that's why we say, if we have 11 brands today, it's going to be 20 tomorrow. It's just a matter of time.","And we focus on gross margin. This is a big part of anybody's financial model. Four ways to get it. First is your continuous improvement program, which is we call Good to Great. The second thing is supply chain optimization. Occasionally, we expand a plan to invest in new capital equipment. Third thing is new products. You want to launch new products that have a higher gross margin than the product that it's replacing. And finally, acquisitions. Virtually every business we buy, we find ways to improve them and expand their gross margins.","Our compensation structure is very simple. So, there's four things, net revenue, gross margin, EPS and cash flow. It's been like this for quite a while. It's 25% each. Everybody understands it and we keep it simple. And we also have an all employee bonus, and 25% of that is tied to gross margin. So, when you have a simple incentive compensation plan, it does promote financial literacy. People in our company know what cash flow is, they know what gross margin is, and it helps get it.","All right. Now, I'm going to bring Rick up here to wrap it up, and then after that, we'll have some Q&A.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you, Matt. I'm going to go through the outlook, talk about 2017 and how we finished that with a lot of momentum, and then we'll spend a couple of seconds \u2013 or minutes on the Evergreen Model as well. So, just as a backdrop, right, the Evergreen Model, 3% organic net sales growth. We've been doing that for quite a while, and that's kind of the bedrock of the model. Gross margin, typically 25 basis points of expansion, and Matt just walked you through some of those details.","Marketing, in terms of percentage is flat, but in dollars is up typically year-over-year, and Britta walked you through how we're better targeting consumers in the digital space. SG&A, we leverage as the top line grows, and we get about 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, which leads to 8% EPS growth before those acquisitions. We talked about this within the last year a couple of times. You heard it again today. When we're talking about 3% organic sales growth, we're saying 2% for the Domestic business, 6% for International and 5% for SPD. And of course, if any one of those over-deliver, that falls to the bottom line.","Okay. Q4 2017, you've read it in the press release this morning. We had a great finish to the year. Organic sales growth was almost 3.5%. Our outlook was 2.5%. So, just far and away, just great broad-based strength from across all of our brands. One to note is our personal care growth was up 4% organically, right, so just a lot of momentum there. Reported growth was 15% versus our outlook at 12%. About 1% came from organic, 1% came from the Waterpik acquisition, and then 1% came from currency and some of the other smaller acquisitions.","Consumer organic was up 3.2%, and gross margin, in a world of higher commodity costs, we were up 50 basis points for the quarter. Operating margin was up 90 basis points and EPS was up 18% to $0.52. So, as you can see through the bar chart, Q4, we exited with a lot of momentum. That's kind of the theme. 3.4% was the high watermark for the year. If you look at it from any angle on a two-year stacked basis, again, Q4 was a really strong quarter, 6.7% for the Consumer \u2013 Global Consumer business.","Turning to the full-year really quick, 2017 organic sales growth was 2.7%, almost 3%. Gross margin was up 10 basis points. Marketing was down slightly at 12%, which is a key number for us. SG&A was up largely because of some of these acquisition costs, right. We have non-cash amortization. We bought \u2013 some of these acquisitions have higher SG&A rates. We have some transition costs. So, SG&A is up slightly. So, that leaves the operating margin being down slightly.","EPS is up 10% to $1.94. And then, a hallmark of this company is cash flow and cash flow generation, so $637 million or 123% free cash flow conversion. So, the theme there is just a lot of momentum, and so not only did personal care grow, but a couple of quarters ago \u2013 and we talked about this last quarter on the call, the promotional environment, right. In Q2, price\/mix was negative 600 basis points for us in the Domestic business. It was minus 490 basis points in Q3. It was minus 100 basis points in Q4. So, that environment is improving as well in those key categories.","Okay. Turning to the outlook, 16% to 18% adjusted EPS growth in 2018. That's just head and shoulders above our peer group. Reported sales growth is around 8% with the acquisitions. Organic sales is 3%, very consistent to what you just saw on the previous page. Gross margin is flat. We can attack that a little bit. But in a world where you're hearing from all of our peers about negative gross margin, we're actually proud that this is a flat number. Commodity headwinds and transportation headwinds at around 50 basis points to 70 basis points, offset by productivity and some help from volume and mix, but again gross margin being flat for the year.","Marketing flat. SG&A is up year-over-year. That's really what you saw in Q4, the acquisition, full-year impact of those dollars. Operating margin slightly down. And as a result, other expense is minus $70 million. That's largely the interest expense from the $1.4 billion that we took out earlier in the year. And then, the effective tax rate 24% to 25%, that's a range with the new tax act. And there's a range there, because as we go through the year and regulation becomes clearer, we will tighten that range. And then, EPS is 16% to 18%. And I just want to be clear on this slide, because I know there are some questions. But absent tax reform, we would have been 9% EPS growth, right. I just want to be clear on that.","Okay. Looking at the track record from 2013 to 2018, 3% or higher typically organic sales growth, and 2018 is no different. Focus on gross margin, we've had a steady run-up over the past few years. We have a great productivity program. We think that's going to continue to pay dividends in the future. I talked about commodities a little bit. But resin and surfactants, we said maybe a quarter ago that we thought that we're going to have recovery in the back half. Resins and surfactants are up around mid-single-digits, whereas diesel is up in the teens.","Polypro as an example or a type of resin is up 20% on a spot basis, so just some headwinds there. Transportation, you've heard in a lot of different calls as well. Just the industry in general is tightening, right, capacity is tight. So, these costs are our headwinds. But as I said before, we think that with all the great work we're doing internally that we're going to make sure the gross margin is flat year-over-year. Marketing spend is key, that drives consumer behavior at the end of the day, and we make sure we invest a lot of money there. Remember, we were one of the top 20 largest advertisers in the U.S.","SG&A management, we haven't lost our way. This is the hallmark of the company. This is in our DNA. SG&A management is really important to us. This is really mostly due to acquisitions and non-cash charges, and this is what the next slide shows. We're largely flat as you go through history, if you strip out some of those non-cash charges. So, then the end message is a great one, strong adjusted EPS growth, double-digits, 16% to 18% in 2018.","One thing that many of our long-term investors get is how much cash flow we do generate. If you look at revenue, we're always maybe one of the smaller companies, around $4 billion in 2018 in the peer set. But if you turn and look at cash, free cash flow conversion, we're typically near the top of the chart. And so, we've had a great ability in the past, and we think we have a great one in the future too to generate cash.","We do this a few different ways. Cash conversion cycle, our working capital management has gone from 52 days to 18 days over time, right. So, we continue to believe that we have goals of zero working capital. We have a strong balance sheet. Despite doing the acquisitions this year, we're still around 2.5 times. We have a belief that by the end of 2018 that we'll be at or below 2 times levered. And so, when you hear that, number one, prioritized uses of cash flow is TSR-accretive M&A. And as Matt said, today, we have 11 or 12 power brands and we're looking for 20 in the future.","So, number one is accretive M&A. Number two is debt reduction, right. We've moved that up the list as we bring that net leverage ratio down. New product development, CapEx, and then return cash to shareholders. We're not a capital-intensive company either. We're about 1.7%. It bumped up a little bit in 2018 in the outlook as we bought Waterpik. And then, in addition, we have good news on the dividend, a 14% increase in the dividend in 2018, 117 consecutive years, so just a bedrock.","And with that, I'd like to invite the rest of management team to come up, and we'll answer any of your questions.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right, don't be bashful, come on up. Okay. Let me tell you who is with us here today, so if you want to direct your questions, we got, you know Rick; you know Lou Tursi, who runs our Sales Organization. We have Carlos Linares, who runs R&D; and we have Rick Spann, who runs Supply Chain. And here, we have Patrick, who's our General Counsel. Britta, you know is our Chief Marketing Officer; Judy Zagorski, Head of HR. We have Scott, who presented on Animal Productivity; and you know Steve runs International. So, floor is open for questions. Okay, Kevin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. I wanted to start, Matt, with your take on the pricing environment. There's been a lot of discussion on it in the marketplace. We've had a lot of disappointing results from some of your peers. Your quarter was actually quite good in that respect. So, a couple of questions related to that. How are the pricing discussions going? I understand that you guys often don't lead in terms of when pricing is taken in the industry.","But I guess what investors are wrestling with, has something changed here within the construct of private label, within what's going on with Walmart and Amazon. Is there less ability to take pricing? Do brands seem to matter less? Is that what's causing some of the perhaps reluctance to take pricing at this point? And then, maybe you could just sort of wrap into that, how much pricing, if any, is baked into your 3% guidance for fiscal 2018. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I'll try to remember your six questions, so I can get them in order. Well, for starters, you've heard Rick comment about the trend in price, if you look at our organic number, so there was a big price in Q2, less in Q3, less in Q4. So, the trend is favorable. Second thing is commodities. When you have that kind of commodity pressure, that should tamper everyone's appetite to drop price and to compete on price. A third thing I would say is that generally when it comes to price, you really need to have a pretty significant position in a category.","So, for baking soda, we have a 75% share, condoms 70% share, those you might expect, you might be able to take some price. But generally, you need the story behind it. For condoms, it would have to be latex cost. You get the idea. So, if you look at us, I said earlier on that we don't have as much exposure to private label. On a weighted average basis, we're around 10% to 11%. So, we don't have the same story as others. And I'll ask Lou if he wants to comment about any conversations we're getting from our retail partners.","Louis H. Tursi, Jr. - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, what I would say is the environment really hasn't changed all that much. It's never easy to take price in any year. I would start by saying that. I would agree with everything that Matt said that sequentially between Q2, Q3 and Q4, the promotional environment has gotten better. For all the reasons Matt said, we're expecting, in 2018, nothing much to change. As far as the promotional environment goes, I would say it's still high, right. It's not low. It's still high. But sequentially, it's gotten a little bit better. And with the commodity cost going up, it should temper the situation and kind of calm it down a little bit.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I'd add is from the outlook perspective, it's largely volume driven in terms of organic growth.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Jason?","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Maybe talking on the gross margin a little bit, the confidence you have in the flat gross margin outlook. So, I know we've talked about \u2013 maybe you talk about where you're locked into some of your commodity costs, the Good to Great program. And then, is pricing \u2013 kind of dovetailing off of Kevin's question, is that still an option if commodity costs still run a little bit higher? So, just looking at the HPC landscape and the confidence you have that flat is the right number.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, I'm going to let Rick \u2013 the two Ricks comment on that. But I'll begin by saying that we have a very robust Good to Great program. So, our continuous improvement program, we're already working on 2019, and we could tell you what programs we have in 2019. Sometimes when you're debottlenecking things, you have to do one thing before you do the next. So, we know going into the year that we have things to offset commodity increases. The second thing is, yeah, we do have a hedging program, and I can ask Rick to comment on that.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. From a gross margin perspective, we're about 50% hedged on our key commodities. We have seven of them that we track all the time. I walked you through some of the movements in key commodities. But the other tailwind we have is some of the mix is, I think, going our way with \u2013 as the personal care business has continued to improve over time. So, that's going to help. I'll let Rick opine on the G2G program, but we've had some great incremental steps in our productivity program.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Rick, maybe you can comment on opportunities in the supply chain.","Rick Spann - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, we are certainly renewing our focus on the Good to Great program. We are exploring areas that \u2013 where we felt as though the pipeline had gone dry. But now with some changes in our focus, we're able to dig into new areas to increase our delivery on Good to Great. So, as Matt said, the pipeline, we're looking at a pipeline through 2019, and of course, focusing this year on bringing home a good delivery of savings in 2018.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Bill?","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Bill Chappell, SunTrust. I had two questions. One on the International, just maybe a little more color \u2013 I don't know what the old Evergreen Model was for International, but maybe you didn't change your overall model. So, maybe help me understand where you come up with 6% from developing versus developed and then how does that affect. Is that assuming that the U.S. Consumer \u2013 maybe is it slower than it used to be over the long-term?","And then, the second question just on new products. I guess in the past, the presentations have been much more focused on a pretty robust big new products, everything from the CLUMP & SEAL to Oxi detergent to what have you. This seems to be a year of maybe more smaller innovation. Is that the right way to look at it, where you're putting more of the marketing behind just kind of the brands and categories versus big new innovation?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. I'll comment on the Evergreen Model. I'll have Steve and Britta comment on both International and the new products. The Evergreen Model once upon a time was 3% to 4%, if you went back 10 years. And that, a couple of years ago, became 3%. So, that was Evergreen Model 1.0. So, we're a lot more granular now with respect to how we're going to grow in the future. And we have the luxury of having an International business growing 6% and a more balanced animal productivity business that can grow 5%. That takes a lot of the pressure off the U.S. business. So, that's why the way to think about it is U.S. is 2%, International 6% and Specialty Products is 5%. I'll let Steve comment further on his confidence in the 6%.","Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, I'm certainly very confident in the 6%. I made several mention of that. But I think back to Matt's point, they were banging around that 4%, 4%-plus over time, and I think that simply because the U.S. represented such an opportunity and was growing much faster. And so, all the time and attention largely went to the Domestic business. Not until we really changed the strategy, did we say, jeez, we really think we can really fundamentally change our participation in the International marketplace and really get behind very strong growth. And we wanted to prove that, one, to ourselves first that we had strategies that we could rely on, depend on, and then build enough scale that really is material for the company. So, I think we've done that.","To your question in terms of \u2013 certainly emerging markets are going to play a much bigger role in driving growth. Our Asia-Pac business will be growing very strong, we expect that, for next year and beyond. Certainly, the developed markets, the traditional markets, Europe for example is not going to grow nearly as strong as \u2013 whether it be any of our LatAm businesses or Asia-Pacific businesses. So, it is going to be weighted that way.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Now, back to your question about new products, the one thing you got to keep in mind is go back to what we said. So, SLIDE was a fabulous product for us in 2017 and took share. So, we're going to ride that even harder next year. And you were talking about laundry detergent. We are rocking in Pods. So, what happened in Pods the last two quarters, there were 3% growth. We're growing double-digit in Pods, and we have a lot of runway to go there. So, we had some new products in 2017 in both the litter and the detergent, and we see a lot of good things ahead for us in both those categories. Britta, do you have anything to add on the new products?","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, I definitely want to add something. So, mea culpa, normally at this point, we're showing you the TV commercials of the new product, and that's maybe why you have the impression that we are not giving it the same full support, mea culpa, because we haven't got them ready yet. So, what you will see soon is exciting news and TV commercials for the new product, which I hope will reinforce your confidence that we give it full support, we're very excited.","Scott Druker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah...","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","ODOR BLASTERS will be a blast.","Scott Druker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I'd like to build too. So, I wouldn't look at it the kind of the way you worded it. I would look at it more this way. Every once in a while, you get surprised with an innovation. SLIDE would be one. So, now we're expanding the distribution of SLIDE year two. We launched ODOR BLASTERS in the laundry detergent last year and didn't really fully capitalize on how big of an idea that was. Batiste is a growing monster, and we have a lot of distribution to continue to gain. So, those are examples that I would say there's a lot of opportunity through the innovation that we've launched on how we can expand that moving forward.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Joe (01:02:07)?","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Matt. So, both you and Rick mentioned earlier today that ex tax, you guys would be growing the top line 3% organic and EPS 9%. I guess the delta in terms of the investments that you're investing back in the business is about $0.10. So, A, why aren't we seeing faster growth this year? I know there's a lag time between those investments and faster growth. Or B, is it that you have to reinvest that $0.10 every year going forward to still get that 3% top line? Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","The way you should look at that is \u2013 and if you're listening today, we have a lot of opportunities here to reinvest. So, you heard about International and you heard about digital. We're maintaining our marketing spend at 12%. It would naturally be lower because Waterpik has a much lower spend. You heard about animal productivity and our expansion there. So, that spend is a permanent spend. So that's going to help fuel us in the future. And in a way you answered your question, Jo, and that it takes a little bit of time, but healthy companies can approach the tax cut very differently than others. So it gives you degrees of freedom and start looking ahead not to 2018, but 2019 and 2020, and that is how we're looking at it. And if you listen to the things I just described where we can put the money, we will make the right choices to sustain our model going forward.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","The analogy I use sometimes is M&A. And sometimes people who have a base business is going backwards has to do a bad deal, that's a reach for something. And so, that's never been the case here. Our business is performing very well, we just had a great quarter, great end of the year. And those are the investments from the same concept as we want to make sure the algorithm is bulletproof 10 years later.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Steve?","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean to build on that though, should we be thinking about this as an \u2013 this extra investment in 2018, is that insurance policy against 2019\/2020 and beyond or should we expect a return on this investments such that we get an acceleration of the algorithm in 2019\/2020, question one. Question two is, free cash flow conversion expectation for next year, that'd be helpful. And question three for Lou is if the categories are growing, I think it was 2.7%, 3%, you're growing with those categories presumably maybe even a little bit faster than at the shelf, but you're also getting distribution gains, why is the call 3% and not better. Those are my three. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. If you look at our history, this is not a company you want to bet against. So we deliver on our commitments. And our commitments to our shareholders have been that we're going to drive that Evergreen model year after-year-after-year. So, we're going to make investments this year we're going accelerate investments that we might have done over maybe the next two years to three years. We're not prepared today to say suddenly we're changing our model and now we're going to have much higher top line and bottom line. The people who invest in this company are taking a five-year view and they have confidence that we can nail that for the next five years, and that's why they invest in us.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. The other comment I'd add to that is, we always measure ourselves versus our peer group as well. So ex-tax reform, if we're around 9% EPS growth, then the peer group's 4.5%. If post-tax reform we're 16% to 18%, the peer group is 6.5%, 7%. So, we feel very happy and very satisfied with where we're at on that sliding scale.","Your free cash flow conversion question, on average, we've averaged around 120% free cash flow conversion. That will dip down because of the new tax law, right. Cash tax rate and book rate converge over time. So, if I was doing a model, I'd probably model it around 110%.","Louis H. Tursi, Jr. - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","On the shelf, I really go and doing this for 14 years. I think hopefully you will agree that we live by the commitment almost like the Eagles, where we're the underdogs and we like to deliver. Building on what Matt said, there is \u2013 you'd never hear me talk about destocking, you never hear me talk about hurricanes, you never hear me bring up anything like that. We are consistent. We put a number out there that we believe we can hit under all conditions and we deliver it.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Hey, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Just thinking through your margin, what is the impact of international and the animal feed growing faster than your base business? Number one.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, the good news is over time those gross margins are converging on actually the company gross margin. So it's not that different for international to the corporate gross margin. The productivity business \u2013 animal productivity business does have a little bit lower gross margin, but some of those recent deals we've done have margins in the 60s and 70s, right. And so those are really the fast growing business as well. So, I'd say, minimal impact overall of those two divisions growing faster.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. And if I just could ask on Waterpik, how much of the business is the sort of one-time purchase of the equipment? And how much is recurring service sort of replacement blade idea? And how do you see that changing over time?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","You're talking about CapEx?","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","No, I'm talking about the consumer purchase, the blade and razor idea? Are you with Waterpik selling...","Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Today, 100% of that business is just the equipment. The example that I showed on the screen, the whitening one, and maybe Britta wants to talk a little bit about that, that is the first entrance into like a refillable type of scenario.","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So we're learning lots about Waterpik. And I think we would struggle with exactly the questions you have. So, actually different households act differently. We have a few people, maybe some of them in the room. They buy it once, and that's it. But we obviously also have a lot of dedicated families where we can see the first family member has one and then they actually extend it over the family. So if you look at households, there is repeat purchase. And then of those people who actually get into the habit of using it, we also see that people renew the models. There is a constant upgraded improvement, and also we are branching out into areas, which you might have seen the latest models are extremely Silicon Allegan. There's something like bathroom aesthetics. So people buy those, or we are now launching a model, which is a travel model for those people who cannot be without that fresh and clean feeling. So, there's lots of opportunities to either extend into more households. Household penetration currently is only around 16%, electric toothbrushes is around 40%, so huge household penetration opportunity.","Secondly, more devices per household; thirdly upgrades per household; and then as I said fourthly, this is early days. My expectation, I have some background in razors and blades is that the first product we launch will not be the success on the replenishing model, but over time, we will get it right, and then life gets really exciting.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","My last question is most important, can you scrape our bodies the way you do the chickens and figure out how to give us the right probiotic.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I'm sure somebody is working on that, okay. Yeah. Over here.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks. I have a question on your probiotic or vitamin business. You guys put a slide up there where you show that you've lost share and it's the first time in the last few years. So could you drill down a little bit more on what are the key drivers of that share loss, the competitive environment? And then what's your outlook for that business this year? And is your goal to stabilize share and how do you expect to accomplish that? Is it through innovation, stepped up spending, promos for instance behind that business.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. You're talking about the gummy vitamin business.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, let me just start, I'm going to hand it over to Britta. The way to think about that is that the category continues to grow double digit. So although we may not be growing at double digit, our consumption continues to grow. So, the business continues to grow. And when we bought that business, it had six competitors, today it has 30. So, there are a lot of people that are piling in there. So it's a growing category, grows double digit, we continue to grow. I think what will happen over time frankly is that there will be a shakeout, and it's not going to happen this year or the next year, but generally retailers can sustain that many brands on the shelf. Britta, you can add that?","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, building on that what you saw was AOC share Nielsen. Nielsen in this category only covers 70% of the market. I just talked about how much and that we have market dominance on Amazon. So actually if you put those together, our share picture would be much more positive, first of all. Second, we do have innovations, and third, we are absolutely confident we will grow that.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Over here, Peg (01:11:23).","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer. So, maybe just going back to the international segment, I was curious, clearly, you guys are doing well with Amazon in the domestic segment. Are you able to leverage your Amazon relationship and maybe some of the other retail partners as you grow internationally?","Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, I would say that we're doing just that, Actually both in Canada and Europe, where Amazon is making significant investments. And we're taking the learnings that the domestic team has and applying them in our international markets. I would put Costco in that category as well \u2013 strong, global, retailer, and we're very successful with them in many parts of the world.","Unknown Speaker","And then if I could just go into the slide before in your online sales growth. I think your online sales are now 5% of your sales. Is your online penetration continues to increase, are you seeing any impact on your gross margins?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. The good news is across the portfolio largely gross margins online and in bricks-and-mortars are very similar. So, no, we're not.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. This way, Peg (01:12:30). Olivia, right there.","Unknown Speaker","Olivia.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thanks. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the latest and greatest in the laundry category. And then also in terms of 2018, can we talk about the component of volume versus price mix? And then just lastly in terms of M&A, you talked about gross margin and the importance of that, but both Waterpik and vitamins were gross margin dilutive. So, can you marry some of the comments around M&A and the importance of gross margin? Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. You started off with the laundry category. So, the laundry category in the fourth quarter was flattish. It was less promotional frankly sequentially. So, that's all good news. If you look at the brands in the categories that are doing really well, one would be ARM & HAMMER. So, we've grown \u2013 no surprise, ARM & HAMMER grew in the fourth quarter and also on a full-year basis. So, that is our flagship brand in detergent.","Within the category deep value was (01:13:33) struggling. So, that would be brands like our brand Xtra, Sun and Purex. So, all three of those brands lost share last year. So, that's \u2013 so Xtra is a leaky bucket for us, but the combination of our three brands ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN and Xtra, we grew share in \u2013 I think we're up 50 basis points or 60 basis points of share all in, in the laundry category. And Pods, I mentioned earlier, I said Pods has slowed down quite a bit in last two quarters. We continue to grow double digit.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And in terms of price mix and volume for the organic call (74:12), I kind of touched on that before, it's largely volume-based. I'm not going to go into too much more detail, but it's largely volume-based. We probably have some positive mix offsetting any price as personal care continues to do well.","And then, I think your third question was, was it gross margin with acquisitions, with M&A?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","(01:14:30-01:14:39)","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Just, you know, our aspiration to gross margin accretion from every M&A deal we do, right. That's definitely the goal. Waterpik is, I'd say largely neutral to gross margin. We think over time, right, we said when we made that announcement in August that we're going to spend around $10 million in 2018 to get $10 million of synergies in 2019. So, I'd expect in 2019 for some of the gross margin to be a little bit more accretive for Waterpik. So, remember just like the Avid deal, when we did, vitamins, when we bought the business, it was a 38% gross margin, and we got up to 45% over two years, and that was part of Matt's slide on how we expand gross margin and just the run way for productivity, so.","Scott Druker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And the only thing I would add too from a retailer shelf standpoint, as powder continues to decline, the powder shelf space will continue to decline. And liquid and unit dose is doing well. So you'll see the powder space will move to unit dose and liquid.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Couple more, over here, Peg (01:15:43).","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks. Jonathan Feeney, Consumer Edge. Walmart's made a lot of noise about a lot of categories about on-time and in-full, how they're managing their logistics. Could you comment maybe about logistics broadly for 2018, those cost, and any particular categories you've had to think differently about deliveries maybe extra expense, and maybe why you don't seem to be as impacted as some others? I know Clorox, it was pretty big impact. They weren't able to get a lot of product to market. Why are you able to succeed so much better and presumably as you're talking about 2018 continue to do that? Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, well, I'll say a few words and if there's anything Rick wants to add, he can. Yeah, as far as trucking and the shortage of truckers, that's pretty much common knowledge. So, we got out ahead of that in November, and we worked with our carrier partners to ensure that we were going to have trucks available and be able to keep up our fabulous record on on-time performance. And we would expect to do that again in 2018 with our transportation partners. (01:16:58) to add to that?","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. The only thing I would add, Matt, is that, we have over 100 carriers that we work with, but 10 of those deliver 80% of our product, of our volume. And so, we were able to partner very closely with those 10 and we've been able to ensure that we had adequate supply of containers and drivers, so we've been ahead of the curve there, as Matt said.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Jason?","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Jason English, Goldman Sachs. Congratulations on a good quarter. I had a couple of questions, maybe the first for Britta or Lou, I'm not sure which. Personal care had a bit of a tough year, but finished on a really strong note, can you give us some of the underlying drivers of what drove the acceleration of fourth quarter and lay out maybe where your expectations are as we head into the new year?","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, if you ask me, of course, it's great advertising.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","That's right.","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. I think that we did do \u2013 so, yeah, absolutely. I think one of the things we're finding is, when we talked about category growth early as well, there's, a, some of our categories like condoms where we talked for long time, young people are, with absolute number declining, are having less sex, we heard all about that I think several times, and they're moving online, right. So, these are things which are difficult to scale. I think we have great campaigns in place now. Same for vitamins, I think we've seen a clear up-tick on our vitamin campaign, Vitamin Better. So, I would say we are driving those sales, particularly in the later quarter and we've also put some investments behind it.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Just to echo what Britta said, it was really broad-based in the personal care business, it was across many different brands. So, just a good combination of innovation over the long-term and great advertising.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","You had a second one?","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I do. I want to come back and try to beat the gross margin horse again. First, can you help us maybe unpack the fourth quarter a bit? It was pretty strong, your 60 basis point full-year commodity drag I think suggests maybe around 140 basis point drag in the fourth quarter, is that kind of right and do you expect something similar to next year?","And then the last couple of quarters, not the fourth quarter, because you know the detail, I know M&A was a positive 100 bps contribution third quarter, plus 70 bps in the second quarter, what if anything did it add in the fourth, and are we looking for a similar sort of contribution to help us sort of bridge our way to flat in the face of, what looks like it's going to be a fairly onerous commodity environment next year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, lot of details in there. I'd say in general in Q4, I think we had around 70 basis points help from acquisitions offset by maybe price mix of minus 30 basis points, minus commodities of, not 140 basis points, but maybe 40 basis points or 50 basis points, and then positives from price mix, I mean mix really.","You're right, we've had some benefit in 2017 from M&A on the gross margin line, and conversely, we've had some negative help from the SG&A line for these same acquisitions. So, I think it's kind of neutral on an operating margin basis. In 2018, we expect 0 to 10 basis points from M&A. So, it is not a tailwind in 2018. What I talked about earlier was personal care, the fact that we've hedged, the fact that we have a great productivity program, so those are kind of what's going on.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Peg (01:20:34)","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. So I wanted to just go back to Jason's question, as you look into outlook for 2018, you mentioned like M&A would not be a tailwind, but I wanted to basically if you can put it in as a ranking, let's say, you mentioned that the mix International wouldn't affect you that much. So maybe like you're going to be investing more in innovation this coming year or you're seeing more of the raw materials had rolling over into 2018. So, we're going to feel more of the impact of the raw materials into 2018. So if you can kind of help us elaborate or on an EBITDA basis you actually would see margins expand, so excluding the non-cash charges?","And the second question will be on sexual health, I think she alluded to improving trends, but if you can comment on the 3%, if you're assuming market share gains, market share will actually improve on a total channel basis when you include in also Internet. Thank you.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And maybe I'll take the gross margin, and you could take the revenue.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Maybe I'll do the sexual health one. And you can think about that extended gross margin multifaceted question. So, as far as sexual health goes, so you probably heard us talk about in previous calls that people are having less sex. And also there is also prevalence of other alternatives. So for example the IUDs, Plan B et cetera. So, all of that is contributing to the category.","Another thing I would point out is demographics. So, if you look at the 18 to 24 year old population today versus where it was, say, four, five years ago, it's smaller and that's not going to turn around till 2021. So, there is lots of things that are influencing the sales of condoms in the United States, but we have 70% share, so we certainly like our chances in the future and we're in it for the long term. And Britta, do you have anything to add to them?","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I just want to add, I think actually our toy business is going very well. So, those people who are having sex are having more fun.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And then...","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, did I give you enough time, Rick?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. A lot of focus on gross margin, I guess, right. In the industry, there is a lot of pressure on gross margins, so I get the question, right. I would have said back in August, if I gave you a gross margin outlook, it would have been positive 30 basis points to 40 basis points. And so, we're well positioned and a lot of those things are structural, right. A lot of the G2G productivity programs we've had in place for years now, that are coming to fruition now. We were hedged last year about 50%, we're hedged this year about 50%. There is no turnover that's happening on resin per se that's causing us any flux.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","(01:23:32)","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, it's a fair point that if it was that material, then yes, that would happen. But resins, I think it sometimes is overblown for Church & Dwight, how material it is. It's not like a Clorox in the Glad trash bag business. We have resin in laundry bottles, yeah we do, but it's not as exposed that I think we could ask about it. So, it's one of the seven, it's probably one of the top four, but it's not the number one.","So, I don't know if there is any other questions besides that, but really, and we have a lot of confidence in 2018 margin because of the productivity programs that we've done about for a year or two, because of the personal care mix coming. We still launch accretive new products, we haven't changed that. We still aim to launch accretive new products with innovation, right, SLIDE is a great example, Clump & Seal is a great example. We're moving up the litter category, units aren't really going up, but the price premium for the consumer is.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. So, we've been at this for a good while now. Of course, we only have the room for so long. I just want to thank everybody for coming today. The team that you see up here is representative of the kind of talent that we have at the Church & Dwight, and we are very confident in our future. And I think you would all have to agree that what we're calling for 2016 is head and shoulders over our peer group. Thanks for coming."],"4875":["Church & Dwight Co. Inc.

Before we begin, I\u2019ve been asked to remind you that on this call, the company\u2019s management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company\u2019s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in the detail in the company\u2019s SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Jim Craigie","Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have great results to report. I\u2019ll start off this call by providing you with my overview of our third quarter business results, which you\u2019ve read about in our press release this morning. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, who will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I\u2019ll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We\u2019ll then open the call to field questions from you.","Let me start off by saying that I\u2019m very proud of my team for delivering excellent third quarter business results in such a difficult business environment. Despite continuing headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures, Church & Dwight achieved 4.7% organic sales growth in Q3, driven by record share results on all four of our mega brands. In combination with continued tight control of overhead cost, the company delivered a 30 basis-point increase in operating margin and a 12% increase in earnings per share.","On a year-to-date basis, our organic sales growth is right in line with our annual target of 3%. So the excellent results from the first three quarters of 2014 makes us feel confident in achieving our aggressive annual EPS growth target of 8%, which would place us in the top quartile of EPS growth for the entire CPG industry. I am also pleased to report that we\u2019ve completed the acquisition of several leading women\u2019s healthcare brands from the Lil\u2019 Drug Store Products Company. This acquisition meets the company\u2019s acquisition criteria which have been a key driver of our consistently strong EPS growth. We expect the acquisition to be earnings neutral in 2014 and accretive to earnings per share in 2015. Let me assure that we are continuing to aggressively pursue acquisitions.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt to give you some specific details on our third quarter results and then I\u2019ll return to give you some further insights of results of our key brands and provide additional details and my outlook for the year.","Matt Farrell","Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everybody. I\u2019m going to start with EPS. Third quarter EPS was $0.85 per share that compares with $0.76 in 2013, that\u2019s up 12% from a year ago. And the $0.85 was better than our $0.80 to $0.82 outlook and netted in our $0.85. There is a penny drag from FX year-over-year. We also got a penny of help versus our 34% targeted tax rate.","As far as revenues go, reported revenues were up 4.6% to $842 million. Organic sales were 4.7% exceeding our Q3 outlook of 3% organic sales. And the organic sales [beat] was largely driven by the success of new products and continued strength in our animal nutrition business. Of the 4.7% organic growth, approximately 5.2% is due to volume with 50 basis points of negative product mix and pricing.","Now let\u2019s review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business\u2019 organic sales increased by 3.5%, volume growth contributed 4.3% to organic sales that was partially offset by 80 basis points of negative effect of product mix and price. Our personal care brands had a really good quarter, up 4.9% in total. TROJAN, NAIR, SPINBRUSH and VITAFUSION vitamins all had quarters.","Household was up 2.8%, driven by ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL Cat Litter and OXICLEAN Liquid Laundry Detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of XTRA laundry detergent, L\u2019IL CRITTERS vitamins and ARM & HAMMER unit dose laundry detergent.","Going on to international. International organic growth was up 1.7%, volume increased approximately 3.1% and unfavorable product mix and pricing was a drag of 1.4%. We had strong growth in the UK and Mexico, but that was largely offset by a weakness in Canada.","Turning now to our Specialty Products division; organic sales increased by 22.1%. The animal nutrition business drove 18.2% volume increase with favorable mix and pricing contributing 3.9%. With respect to that favorable pricing, remember that the favorable pricing is attributable to passing through raw material price increases to our customers. Currently, the U.S. dairy industry is very healthy, experiencing near high, no crisis and low input costs, which are driving demand for our products. We expect total company organic sales to be approximately 3% now for the year.","Turning now to gross margin, our reported third quarter gross margin was 43.7% that\u2019s 170 basis points contraction from year ago, which is slightly more than 150 basis points contraction that we expected. This was driven primarily by higher trade spending and higher commodity costs. For the full year, we still expect gross margin to contract approximately 75 basis points. And with respect to commodities year-over-year input costs trended up in Q3 year-over-year in particular due to resin.","Now let\u2019s talk about marketing. Our marketing spend was front-end loaded this year to support all the great new products during the launch. As we said in August, the second half spend is as expected, lower versus a year ago. We continue to monitor our marketing spending on the basis of our share of voice versus our share of market, so we watch that very closely. And we are comfortable with those ratios.","With respect to quarterly marketing spend for the third quarter was at $96.6 million or 11.5% of revenues and that\u2019s a 90 basis point decline from the prior year spend rate and $3.1 million lower on the dollar spend rate. We funded some of the Q3 promotional actions that we talked about in August with lower marketing in Q3.","SG&A: SG&A was low year-over-year by $4 million; as a percentage of net sales, it was 11.1% which is 110 basis-point decrease from the prior year third quarter. And as a result, our reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.1% which was 30 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter.","Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% that compares to last year\u2019s 33.9%; and we continue to expect the full year 2014 effective tax rate to be approximately 34%. Cash flow is next. We generated $408.7 million of net cash from operations for the first nine months of 2014, and we invested $36 million year-to-date in CapEx. And we expect to spend approximately $70 million on CapEx for full year 2014. Cash from operations is expected to exceed $525 million and free cash flow is expected to exceed $450 million.","Regarding buybacks, we have approximately 149 remaining on our authorization, and we may decide to get ahead of 2015 share creep in December of this year.","Now, I want to talk about the acquisition that Jim mentioned in his opening remarks. The company completed the acquisition of REPHRESH, REPLENS and other brands from Lil\u2019 Drug Store on September 19th. We met all of our previously stated acquisition criteria. The brands are number one in their niche categories; they\u2019re asset-light and what that means is the products are co-packed. And we believe it has growth potential and the gross margin is accretive to the company\u2019s gross margin. Annual trailing sales of these brands are $46 million and the $260 million acquisition was initially financed with commercial paper.","A little more color on this. So, REPHRESH is a number one gel for pH balance and vaginal health, and REPLENS is the number one gel to address vaginal dryness which is a common issue for menopausal age women. We expect them to grow at or above our 3% to 4% growth target and these brands fit nicely into our global women\u2019s health portfolio. And many of you may not know that in our international division, we have a vaginal care brand called Femfresh which is about $20 million brand.","Now into some numbers, trailing EBITDA was approximately $17 million. If you do the math on that this is an EBITDA margin of 37% and that would also equate to an EBITDA multiple that we paid of 12 times. So, since this is an asset deal, as many of you know, there is tax shield. So, after taking into account $55 million tax shield and the minor amount of cost synergies, the multiple is actually less the 9%, 8.9% which coincidently is the same fully synergized multiple that we paid for the Avon business in 2012. So, once these brands are fully integrated, the company expects to leverage distribution network and the support functions to generate some additional cost savings.","The acquisition is expected to be earnings neutral to 2014 EPS and approximately $0.02 accretive to earnings per share in 2015 that\u2019s inclusive of two things, financing costs and amortization of intangibles. If we add back the amortization of intangibles that\u2019s about $8 million bucks, the acquisition is expected to be approximately $0.06 accretive to cash earnings per share. And with respect to the financing that\u2019s noted in there, although there are no guarantees, we expect to refinance the commercial paper borrowings with the longer-term instrument at market rates sometime in the future.","I\u2019m going to wrap it up now. The third quarter highlights include 4.7% organic sales and 12% EPS growth. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.78, compared to $0.65 per share last year which is a 20% increase. As Jim has said and will say, we had an impairment charge and litigation costs in Q4, 2013 that aren\u2019t expected to repeat; and this year, we have lower shares, and combined that makes up 10% of the 20% increase in the fourth quarter.","We expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 3% and marketing as a percentage of sales goes to approximately 12.2% for Q4; 12.2% is also our full year marketing target right now.","As we mentioned in the release, we\u2019re tightening our full year EPS range from 7% to 9%, to 8%. Then just one last thing for those of you who are working on your models, on a full year basis, we expect 3% organic sales growth; gross margin contraction of 75 basis points, obviously influenced by slotting and couponing behind new products; as we work our way down to P&L, we now expect marketing at 12.2% of sales for the full year that\u2019s given our Q3 actions and expect SG&A to be down a 100 basis points to 12%, will get you to a 50 basis points of operating margin expansion for full year 2014.","And now back to you Jim.","Jim Craigie","Okay. Thanks, Matt. I\u2019ll finish off our call today by adding a little color to the third quarter results which Matt just took you through, and my outlook for the year.","At the beginning of this year, I told you that Church & Dwight plan for 2014 was based on the belief that innovation was the key to driving our organic sales growth and reviving category growth in this challenging global economy. To back up this belief, we launched a record number of new products in every one of our major categories and three new categories. These new product launches were focused on our 4 megabrands and 5 other power brands. These 9 brands in total represent over 80% of our sales and profits.","In the first quarter of 2014, our sales force did an incredible job in gaining incremental distribution from retailers in every category. Gaining incremental distribution is the key first step for driving future sales and profit growth, so we got off to a great start.","In the second quarter, our goal was to initiate strong consumer demand for the new products via increased marketing support. We also met this goal, as we achieved record quarterly share results on 3 of our 4 megabrands and share gains on 3 of our 5 other power brands.","In the current third quarter, our innovation driven strategy continue to gain momentum driven by record share results on all 4 of our megabrands and 3 of our 5 other power brands. And as we had hoped, our innovations have had a positive effect on category growth as well.","The weighted average of all of our categories has gone from minus 0.8% versus year ago in the first quarter to flat versus year ago in the second quarter and to plus 0.8% in the third quarter. While this weighted average is still below, pre-recessional levels of 2% to 4%, it is headed in the right direction.","I would now like to share some of the specific third quarter results on our key brands. Among our 9 key brands, our biggest focus in 2014 was on turning the OXICLEAN brand into a megabrand by extending it into 3 new categories: premium laundry detergent, bleach alternatives and automatic dishwashing detergents.","Overall, this strategy is off to a great start as consumption of the total OXICLEAN brand in the third quarter was up 35% versus year ago. This included strong results on every form of the brand. The OXICLEAN laundry additive product achieved a record third quarter share of 43.8%, which is more than the next 3 competitors combined. This represents the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year share growth for our core OXICLEAN laundry additive brand.","The new OXICLEAN premium liquid laundry detergent achieved a 1.2% dollar share in the third quarter in the $5 billion liquid laundry category after just seven months in distribution. This represents a 20% increase in sales versus the prior quarter. Most importantly, our consumer research reveals that the sales of our new OXICLEAN premium liquid laundry detergent brand are over 80% incremental to our other liquid laundry detergents.","Our new OXICLEAN auto dish detergent achieved a 2.4% dollar share in the third quarter and has surpassed Colgate-Palmolive brand to become the number three player in the auto dish category. And our OXICLEAN bleach alternative, called White Revive achieved a 2.4% dollar share in the third quarter. Distribution of White Revive was almost entirely incremental as we were able to get it placed in the bleach section rather than laundry detergent section where the core OXICLEAN laundry additive product is located. As a result, sales of White Revive are over 70% incremental to the core OXICLEAN laundry additive franchise.","The strong sales incrementality of our new product is critical to achieving sales growth. Our other megabrands also achieved strong results in the third quarter. Our newest megabrand, the VITAFUSION and L\u2019IL CRITTERS gummy vitamin business, delivered high single-digit consumption growth in the third quarter, behind expanded distribution, new products and increased marketing support.","We achieved this high single-digit consumption growth despite only 1% overall category growth as a result of unfavorable publicity late last year about the benefit from taking multivitamins. The 1% overall category growth for vitamins is actually encouraging news as it represents steady improvement from a negative 2.2% category decline in the first quarter and a flat category in the second quarter. We are optimistic that the vitamin category will soon return to its historic mid single-digit growth levels driven by new products and solid marketing spending by all competitors that reinforce the proven benefits from taking vitamins.","Notably, Church & Dwight\u2019s vitamin business plays in the fast growing gummy form of vitamins, which now represents 7% of the total vitamin category that is more than double what it was when we bought the business in 2012 and that still leads 93% of the $7 billion vitamin category to be conquered by encouraging consumers to switch from swallowing tasteless hard pills to enjoying delicious tasty gummy vitamins.","We have the number one gummy brand for both kids and adults, and Church & Dwight was one of only two vitamin brands to show share growth in the third quarter. These strong results to-date in our gummy vitamin business had built us to put us on track to deliver our strong sales growth outlook of the year despite lower than expected category growth and increased competition.","On our TROJAN megabrand, we achieved a record third quarter share in the total sexual health category, driven by record quarterly sales of condoms and continued growth of our new lubricant line that was launched in 2013. On the largest part of our sexual health business, our TROJAN condom business, we achieved a record quarterly share of 76.6%. Our steady stream of new condom products and strong marketing programs has led to the TROJAN brand representing 26 of the top 30 [fuse] in the category.","Our biggest megabrand, ARM & HAMMER, grew its share in the third quarter despite significant price competition. In the laundry detergent category, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a record quarterly share of 10.3%. This share growth represents the 19th consecutive quarter that the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent brand has posted year-on-year share growth. This share growth has also strengthened the brand\u2019s number one position in the value segment and has enabled the ARM & HAMMER brand to pass the ALL brand to become the number three brand in the total laundry detergent category.","While these were very positive results for the ARM & HAMMER brand, the real star of the ARM & HAMMER mega brand portfolio was our cat litter business. Our new premium price cat litter, called ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL, has been a huge hit with consumers, as reflected in both our brand\u2019s share results and its positive impact on category growth. Our third quarter consumption for our ARM & HAMMER cat litter business increased by over 20% for the second consecutive quarter and our share grew 2.5 points to a record third quarter share of 22.5%.","These great share results strengthen our position as the number two brand in the category. Just as important, our new CLUMP & SEAL product has been a major contributor to driving cat litter category sales growth of over 8%, the strongest growth in any of our 13 categories and excellent growth for any CPG category. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key to driving improved value creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders.","Unfortunately, some of our competitors have not invested in developing new products and instead have increased their trade and coupon spending to defend their brands. This has been happening in several categories, particularly the laundry detergent category. As you know, Church & Dwight is the only competitor to grow share in the laundry detergent category for every year for the past five years. We are now the number two player in the category, and one out of every four wash loads is done with a Church & Dwight laundry detergent.","The growth of our laundry detergent business has been driven by value pricing, great new products, increased distribution and higher marketing spending. As I stated earlier, our largest liquid laundry detergent brand, ARM & HAMMER, has posted year-on-year share growth for 19 consecutive quarters, including share growth in the first third quarters of 2014.","Our OXICLEAN laundry additives brand has posted year-on-year share growth for 12 consecutive quarters and achieved a record quarterly share in the third quarter. In 2014, we launched innovative new products on our ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent brand. And to continue our remarkable record of share growth, we also extended the OXICLEAN brand into the laundry detergent category, with solid results as I mentioned earlier. Overall, Church & Dwight\u2019s total laundry detergent business achieved a record quarterly dollar share of 14.7% in the third quarter.","In a liquid detergents category which represents over 70% of total laundry detergent sales, Church & Dwight achieved an all time record quarterly share of 17.5%, driven by record quarterly share on the ARM & HAMMER brand and the incremental share delivered by our new OXICLEAN liquid laundry detergent products.","Hopefully, our laundry detergent competitors will come to share or belief that launching innovative new products is the preferred method of competition for both our consumers and retailers. We are anticipating a more normalized promotional environment starting in this quarter.","I will finish off our portion of the call today with a few words and our outlook for the year. As stated in the press release, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance of organic sales growth of approximately 3% and we are tightening our annual earnings growth target to 8%. This will be driven by our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead cost.","Our 8% earnings growth target is in the upper quartile of EPS growth target ranges in the CPG industry consistent with our historical performance. And we are highly confident that we can deliver this aggressive target given the strong momentum exiting Q3.","I also want to once again assure you that we are actively pursuing additional acquisitions and have over $2 billion of financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions, because we are very selective about the type of businesses we acquire. At the same time, we are also fiscally responsible to our shareholders, so we will continue to be patient until we find the right deals that will pay dividends for many years to come.","Now before opening the call to questions, I\u2019d like to mention of organizational announcement that we made this morning. I\u2019m pleased to announce that Farrell will be assuming a broader leadership role within the company. In addition to his current role as Church & Dwight\u2019s Chief Financial Officer in which he has a superb track record, Matt will also become our Chief Operating Officer with all line functions reporting to him. This expanded role will enable Matt to leverage his terrific depth knowledge of organization and the CPG industry to continue to build on the company\u2019s outstanding track record of results. This organizational change will also allow me to focus more time on long-term corporate strategy and finding accretive acquisitions.","In conclusion, 2014 is shaping up to be another very challenging year. But when things get tough, you should place your best in the company with the product portfolio and new product pipeline that can thrive in such an environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver consistently strong EPS growth.","That ends our presentation. I\u2019ll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","","Hey. Just kind of looking at the organic growth guidance and obviously came better this quarter, but you only kept a 3% for the year. So was there anything that was pull forward from the fourth quarter? Do you think you will be conservative in the fourth quarter, kind of what\u2019s changed relative to when we spoke last?","Matt Farrell","","Yes, Bill. It\u2019s Matt. As you know, the specialty products business has been flying pretty high and Q4, they\u2019re going to be coming down earth. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s going to be lower sequentially. In Q3, as you know, we took actions to particularly in the laundry category which we talked about on the last call, was actions we decided upon in May; June got a lot better year-over-year followed by July, August and September. So that kinds Q3 was influenced by those, but it seems though we expect the relatively normalized commercial line in Q4 so that\u2019s also reflected in our top-line.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. And then it seems like you\u2019re a lot more sanguine about the laundry category and the price for them also happened earlier last year. Do you have a sense really kind of like what the planned outlook looks like for next year and what some of the pricing conversations have been, is that why you\u2019re a little more optimistic?","Jim Craigie","No, I think Bill we don\u2019t have any information to share on that. We\u2019re trying to just provide context on our expectation based on what we\u2019re seeing right now. I would just say two facts kind of support that context. One is that improvement in the overall laundry detergent category. The category is still down, it was down 2.3% in Q3, but that\u2019s better than the 3.8% decline in Q1 versus a year ago and the 3.5% decline in Q2. So, we\u2019re seeing improvement in the category and also the promoted price per wash load for liquid laundry detergent was higher in Q3. And keep in mind liquid is still 70% of the business. So we\u2019re seeing some trends, which we like.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Got you. And then just a follow-up on that, I mean does XTRA have to work for laundry to really be [pluming] because that\u2019s the only brand that you wanted to really take a chance a little bit, it hasn\u2019t really kind of does job recently. So I guess is there plan there and do you guys need that brand to work for the broader laundry business to work?","Jim Craigie","Well, we have a portfolio now Bill of three laundry detergent brands and every one of them is important. And we have plans in place to make XTRA do better going forward and I\u2019m not going to reveal those. But yes, it\u2019s a part of our portfolio, but we\u2019re working on it. Overall the portfolio is showing great record share results and XTRA was down a little bit, but we have plans going forward to make that better.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","And congrats, Matt. One time comment, it\u2019s well deserved. Thank you, guys.","Matt Farrell","Thanks Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Good morning. Actually going after that last one, Matt congratulations as well, but can you tell us kind of what the difference is of what you\u2019re doing day-to-day, Jim, other than Matt obviously getting a longer business card?","Jim Craigie","Yes. Well, Bill all I\u2019d say is two key drivers for our fast success, and then we\u2019ve got a very experienced management team and I carefully leverage that team overtime to meet the changing needs of our customers and consumers and to meet the competitive environment that we face in order to live our great business results.","Right now, I wanted build more time to three things; one, long-term corporate strategy; two, acquisitions; and three, developing the organization\u2019s capabilities. I need more time to do that, it\u2019s enabled me to do that. I\u2019ve asked Matt to step up and handle the additional duties of COO. He will be overseeing and coordinating the day-to-day execution of our business. That leverages his last 8 years of experience as our CFO, which he has been involved in all aspects of the business.","Matt, as you guys know; and I appreciate for the incredible Job as our CFO. He is in a position to take on additional responsibilities because he has developed a world class financial team.","So, in my mind this evolution of our management structure is what the company needs right now. Going forward, I\u2019ll continue to make changes in the future if needed to continue deliver outstanding business results. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Okay. And then switching to the operations on the laundry that you\u2019re anticipating the promotional environment getting better this quarter, are you already seeing that in October or did you already see that in October and kind of what gives you comfort, I mean assuming most of these plans were put in place months ago. Should we expect it to get better sequentially?","Jim Craigie","I don\u2019t want to go in detail, Bill, but yes, we\u2019re continuing to see some positive things happening. But it\u2019s still early in the fourth quarter.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Okay. And then, Matt, just as we look out to 2015, I know it\u2019s not big, but based on spot rates today, what\u2019s kind of the currency headwind on your EPS guidance?","Matt Farrell","Thanks for throwing me that beach ball, Bill.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","You\u2019re still the CFO.","Matt Farrell","Yes, right. Current spot rates we calculate to be almost 1.5% drag on EPS. And that\u2019s best baked into our thinking still a high single-digits. So, where it is true that we have an acquisition and it\u2019s going to help us by $0.02 next year, we got more than $0.02 going the other way at current spot rates for FX.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Good morning. Just a question on the operating margin improvements, SG&A productivity since they\u2019ve been driving a lot of the improvement in the quarter, I was wondering what\u2019s behind that. Is that just your general productivity program and what is the sustainability of that progress?","Matt Farrell","Hi Michael, this is Matt. While we expect to sustain the year-over-year dollar saving, it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. You may recall back at the -- in February when we closed the year that we expected a 100 basis points of help year-over-year from SG&A and that\u2019s because of our vigilance with respect to headcount, in fact we had put it in SAP system two years ago now, we continued to try to leverage. We\u2019re far more progressive than any other [CPD] company with respect to how we manage medical and dental cost; in fact our medical and dental costs are down year-over-year as a result of us going to a private exchange. You won\u2019t find many companies that have -- that did that as of 01-01-2014.","So, when I think about 2015, you\u2019re trying to get at the sustainability of the SG&A. improvement. So, we expect to sustain the dollar save. And as you think about our algorithm, you can grow this company 3% top-line. So, if your reported number is 3% top line growth and you can keep a lid on SG&A. So if SG&A can grow 1% or less, you\u2019re going to get 25 basis points of leverage. So that\u2019s half of the 50 basis points of operating margin leverage that we\u2019d be looking for. That\u2019s the simple way to think about it.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Yes, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","","Hi. Good morning. My question is a follow-up to the fourth quarter guidance, so 3% organic sales growth. We understand Specialty is coming down. Can you tell us more about the Domestic Consumer business we just had 3.5% but we\u2019re going into the toughest comp of the year for Domestic Consumer and there is less promotional support. So I\u2019m just wondering if that Domestic Consumer goes down to 2% or something like that.","Jim Craigie","The way I think about it, Alice, is the last couple of quarters, the Specialty Products business has generated more than 1% of our growth. So, if you went back to Q3 for example of that 4.7%, the Specialty Products business was \u2013 number is around 1.5% of that. That\u2019s not going to repeat in the fourth quarter. So when you think about 3% fourth quarter organic growth, the simple way to explain it is that SPD is going to grow, Specialty Products will be less than 1% of Q4 year-over-year, which means the Consumer business is going to be higher. But as far as my ability to tell you exactly what it\u2019s going to be, I\u2019ve whiffed on that last couple of quarters, so that\u2019s as close as I can get it right now.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","","Okay. You don\u2019t mean the Specialty is going to be up 1%, you just mean that it\u2019s adding one\u2026","Jim Craigie","Yes, right. Weighted average, how much that they contribute to the curve.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Yes. Okay, and then by another follow-up, how much were your detergents overall up or not in the third quarter? And that includes all the brands and all the forms including powders. Thanks.","Jim Craigie","Yes. Alice, our share was up 0.1% which was the same as Procter and again which competitors were down on a share basis.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","So, that means your detergents were down a little bit because the category was down?","Matt Farrell","Roughly plus or minus, just to give you an exact number that way around, but I\u2019m going to give you exact number; I want to go check beginning on that one; you\u2019re asking for specific numbers on specific category that\u2019s a double check.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Okay. And then I guess one final one, you haven\u2019t talked about the JV and equity income and that was better than I thought. And could you bring us up-to-date on what\u2019s happening there and what the outlook is maybe for next year?","Jim Craigie","Well, I can\u2019t tell you what is going to be for next year, as far as the full year this year; we expect it to land around 16 million bucks if that helps you, full year 2014?","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","And what\u2019s going on there, why is it growing?","Matt Farrell","It\u2019s cyclical. You do businesses that go up and down. So, if you look at our Ks for the last few years, you\u2019re going to see that it\u2019s driven by the end market, and their input costs, so some end markets are positive right now in that JV. But I wouldn\u2019t say that I would count on there for next year just yes, we\u2019ll update you, everyone.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Okay, good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. ","Jim Craigie","Hi Connie.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","It looks as though the litter market is going towards light weight litters and I am wondering where you are in the development of such a product.","Matt Farrell","I don\u2019t want to announce it and can\u2019t even before we do it. I would just say, we continue to rock and roll on Cat Litter. I think the month of October has just rolled in and we\u2019re up actually 34% over a year ago. So, we continue to do very well. And again, I just have a policy of not announcing new product launches before actually they hit the market. Our competitors like to tip us off, but we don\u2019t do that.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And can you give us your outlook for resin, I think you noted that have negative contributor to the gross margin. A lot of people are expecting resin cost to go down and to follow oil. But what\u2019s your opinion?","Jim Craigie","Yes. What happens with resin, Connie, is that there is less of a correlation with the oil than there used to be historically. So, it seems to be more related to capacity suppliers and outages both planned and unplanned. So, resin is still super high. I know somebody wrote a note about resin coming down, love to see that happen because that looks certainly benefit from that next year, but it would thinking away to see right now.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And just final thing. On gross margin expansion for next year, what would be the contributor to it?","Matt Farrell","Well, remember this week Jim talked about new products this year was a biggest year in years as far as the number of new products that we\u2019ve launched. And along with that came lots of slotting and couponing to stimulate trial. So, next year will be -- we always have great years and next year will be a good year, but we won\u2019t have as many of launches next year in 2015, \u201814 consequently have what we are slotting and couponing and obviously that gives you a bit of a tailwind for gross margin.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning folks.","Matt Farrell","Hey Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Sorry, kind of still off the call there for a bit of time, so I may ask or redone a question, if so I apologize in advance. But I want to pick up that last line of question just done on costs and margins. Good organic sales growth this quarter, bad gross margin performance. You\u2019re calling for an inflection to gross margin expansion next quarter. Can you think that can be sustained as you go to the next year and if so, what are some of the puts and takes?","Matt Farrell","We just talked about the gross margin for next year being influenced by lower slotting and couponing, I don\u2019t know, if you heard that or not, Jason, because we have so many new product launches this year in particular OXICLEAN and that\u2019s going to peel back a bit next year. So that\u2019s a natural lift to gross margin in 2015 versus 2014.","As far as gross margin goes, Q3 to Q4, it\u2019s sequentially a better. You\u2019d probably saw in the release and Jim has made some remarks about that that we expect a more normalized promotional environment, but I comment this with respect in Q4. So we come in 15 or 16 there, but that seems to be the trend right now.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks that\u2019s helpful. And Jim, real quick, usually when we see a COO named, it precedes CEO succession, what\u2019s the likelihood of that happening here?","Jim Craigie","Well, I\u2019m a young 61, someday I will retire, but so that\u2019s all there right now you\u2019re getting out how do your speech is there as far as I\u2019m concerned.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","All right. Good. Thanks a lot guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Hey, good morning, guys.","Jim Craigie","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","And Matt, I wanted to extend my congratulations to you as well.","Matt Farrell","Thanks Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","From a capital allocation perspective, Jim, maybe you can touch on this. So, with respect to M&A, is it that you\u2019re seeing assets that you think make strategic sense and the multiples are just too high? And then alternatively, how should we be thinking about buyback with respect to \u201815 and sort of going forward understanding what you said about share creep here in the remainder of the year? Should we be anticipating something similar perhaps a front-end weighted sort of buyback in\u201915 understanding that it\u2019s a Board decision?","Jim Craigie","Yes Kevin, I\u2019ll address the acquisition environment and let Matt take the share buyback. I would just say it\u2019s a very active environment out there. And it\u2019s more a case of we\u2019re just looking for as I said in my comments for acquisitions that fit our criteria, we\u2019re being selective as we\u2019ve always been and when we make deals, they have long-term benefit in terms of being accretive. So, there is a lot. Again one of the reasons I want to spend more time to be able to pursue these and chase them down because it\u2019s a very active environment, but an environment which we want to be very careful in. We don\u2019t want to repay and we want to make the right long-term deal and it takes a lot of focus to do that. So that\u2019s one the reasons for giving Matt the additional duty of COO.","I\u2019ll let Matt to address the share buyback.","Matt Farrell","","Yes. On buybacks, Kevin, remember when we started the year we had $500 million of cash on the balance sheet, Jan 01, \u201814. And you know we\u2019re a bit cash flow generator. So, we were somewhat opportunistic this year and be able to deploy that cash not having found large enough acquisitions that we thought met our criteria. So, we bought that $430 million of stock this year. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to repeat because the highest and best use of our cash flow is acquisitions. So, the one thing we would commit to is that we would try to address share creep for 2015 and number that\u2019s around $85 million of buybacks.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Okay. And then if I may just one more. And without asking you guys, this is with respect to the product pipeline for \u201815 and understanding you\u2019re not going to front run any new innovation I guess that. But maybe you could just sort of help us sort of prioritize where you think the greatest opportunity is; you called out OXI, where are we I guess in sort of like what inning would you say with OXI in terms of looking at categories that could extend to TROJAN and also the gummy vitamin business and brand extensions there? That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Jim Craigie","Yes, thanks Kevin. I would just say two things: One, our focus going forward will always be to give the strongest support to our four mega brands; and two we\u2019re going to continue to strongly support the major new product launches we made this year. But as Matt referred to, we won\u2019t have to pay slotting fees and we won\u2019t be at introductory coupon levels next year; we\u2019ll just be in of ongoing level. So we\u2019re going to continue to drive the growth. We\u2019re happy with the start; it\u2019s going very well, but we know we need to continue that next year and we\u2019ll be launching of new products on especially on our mega brands next year.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Your line is open. ","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Hi. Just a couple follow-ups. ","Jim Craigie","Hi Windy.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Hi. The guidance for the fourth quarter includes a little bit of the incremental share repurchases pulling forward from next year, is that clear or would that be on top of which you\u2019ve already guided us for?","Matt Farrell","No, that\u2019s not baked in right now.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Okay, fine.","Matt Farrell","I\u2019ll tell you, Windy, but that\u2019s another way we manage the places; we\u2019re always looking for ways to spend back more on media with our brands; to that extent that we did buyback, we probably spend back any of that incremental profits in marketing. ","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Got it. Okay, fantastic. And then can you quantify, I know there have been a couple of questions about the gross margin and the guidance for 75 bps contraction in 2014. How much of that is the slotting fees? Is it 50 bps or 100 bps, just to try to sort of in our own mind add that back and think about where the gross margin is going to go next year?","Matt Farrell","Let\u2019s wait till we get to the end of year and we\u2019re going to call that. So in February, we\u2019ll give you the detail on how much of that was in 2014 and what the tailwind is for \u201815.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Okay, terrific. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks so much.","Jim Craigie","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo.Your line is open.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Hey, thanks guys. I guess the message changed a little on the buyback. I know the last quarter you said don\u2019t expect us to busy any more stock back, now you are saying you pull some forward for share creep. So, I\u2019m just curious is that because of what has happened in the M&A environment relative to what you had expected?","Matt Farrell","No because of the M&A market at all, this is question of do you do it in December or do you do it in January and February, typically do it -- do it we do it front end loaded. So, we\u2019ll just do that in December. But like I said, it\u2019s not going to have an impact our full year \u201814 and a month isn\u2019t going to change -- make a difference with respect o 2015. But we haven\u2019t made that call yet.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then looking on guidance, I know Matt you guys always do good job of managing the next quarter guidance pretty carefully. But when I run the numbers that you are looking for through, there seems to be more flexibility into that Q4 EPS numbers than I\u2019m used to I guess. And I\u2019m wondering if there is anything, maybe I\u2019m not thinking about that will be an incremental drag next quarter that would cause you to only earn what your guidance is relative to the individual components you guys gave out?","Matt Farrell","Could you be more specific about?","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Yes. So, I mean when you run marketing being a 12% 2 for the year and SG&A being at 12% and organic at 3%, you get to an EPS number that\u2019s bigger than what you\u2019re guiding to and by a little bit more of a margin than normally?","Matt Farrell","Yes. We always have puts and takes in a quarter, lots of variables and none of which we will go into today on the call. Mike, as you correctly point out as for quarter ahead and for the full year we\u2019re always pretty careful about what our expectations are so we can help people either way to the numbers. So, the big variable is always going to be the top-line too. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s hardest to call marketing in SG&A and is within our control, but certainly promotional environment and the top-line are not. And although, we might say we expect a relatively normalized promotional environment, it\u2019s still early.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Your line is open.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Good morning and congratulations Matt.","Matt Farrell","Hi. Thanks.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","My questions are; number one, if you could say what\u2019s going on in Canada and whether you expect that to reverse? And number two, on [home care], are there other areas that you can expand into. Can you tell us a little bit about that category and how we should think about growth rates for the category?","Matt Farrell","Yes. Canada is extremely competitive promotional environment right now. Some retailers up there are very aggressive with respect to promotions and who will remain nameless. It\u2019s more or less the (inaudible) of the U.S. And so it\u2019s the 10% of the U.S. sales in the Canada versus U.S. It\u2019s our most important subsidiary, but we\u2019ve had struggles up there with respect to competition this year.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Okay. So retailers rather than the manufactures?","Matt Farrell","Not obviously the retailers there, it\u2019s just we have to compete, right? So, you got to compete with your competitors as well.","Jim Craigie","And Caroline you know there has been retail consolidation up there, some new competitors. It\u2019s just a very volatile market. We are showing some improvement in beginning the Q4. So, we\u2019re optimistic there. It\u2019s just something we\u2019ve been dealing with the environment up there. I think everybody has been dealing with it. And I think again, we had a good month of October overall especially in Canada.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","That\u2019s good. And on (inaudible)","Matt Farrell","What\u2019s the second one, Caroline?","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Just you made these acquisitions in (inaudible) I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that market and whether you see other opportunities to expand there.","Matt Farrell","Oh, you mean in the women\u2019s health?","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Yes, with your acquisition.","Matt Farrell","Look, our women\u2019s health business in the U.S. is essentially a pregnancy kit business. We still have an opportunity using our gummies to expand the first response into another area. This is complementary because we\u2019re already in the business in Europe. So, it\u2019s not -- we\u2019re not strangers to this particular category. These are small categories, but growing. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that we were going to go on a roll up here with respect to women\u2019s vaginal products.","It is a subsection of lubricants. Lubricants is not growing as a total category, but the subcategories within those are growing far more rapidly and that was what the attraction was for us of each of these brands.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","","Thank you. And finally just on vitamins, you said the categories come back to 1% growth. Do you -- from past experience where the categories had that pressed, does it then resume within sort of 6 to 12 months? Do you think you will be back to that mid single-digit?","Matt Farrell","Yes. Usually it does, Caroline. It\u2019s something when we bought this business to be flatter and the category goes up and down based on news in the marketplace. So, we were told about that and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing right now. I can\u2019t predict exactly what number we\u2019ll go to, but it\u2019s definitely had a vacuum in the positive direction now.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Jim Craigie","Hello? Good morning.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, sorry about that. I was on mute.","Jim Craigie","Okay.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, good morning. Congrats Matt. Two questions from my side. Jim, general environment, I guess as we\u2019ve been hearing other companies reporting you\u2019ve indicated that U.S. has kind of improved and I know you\u2019ve had a pretty good handle on the economy going back several years. So, I want to just get your updated thoughts on the State of the Union here in the U.S.? And then the second question is on the vitamin business and I know one of the big initiatives you\u2019ve had with sampling. And I am just curious as now maybe you have some statistics around conversion, around the sampling efforts? Thanks.","Jim Craigie","Yes Nik. The economy -- all I can say if I can go back to what I repeated in my call, so the categories that we\u2019re in, we\u2019re seeing good steady improvement from minus 0.8 to plus or minus in the second quarter the plus 0.8 in the third quarter. I can\u2019t predict it going forward. I mean you read the papers every day, someday it is headwind, someday it is tailwind on that. So, I am just -- maybe I\u2019m snitch more optimistic right now, but as we continue going forward I will tell you there is every day I read the negative news I know if you haven\u2019t seen it there is concerns about the Port of Long Beach in California, with two to three week delays on products coming into the country. Luckily we have very small part of our product line is imports, I don\u2019t see any impact on that, but I feared impact on retailers being able to merchandise stuff in Q4. But overall, it\u2019s just -- I think the categories we\u2019re in again driven by innovation are starting to show some improvement.","The BMS sampling is a key part of that program. We continue to spend more money on that. I don\u2019t have any statistics to give you honestly. So, it\u2019s good news, our business continues to grow; we continue to be number one share position and we\u2019ve got a lot of new products in the pipeline come along. I think we often told we\u2019re right now putting in a new capacity in the plant that will increase our capacity by about 75%. That new production lines will be up and running soon. So we have lots of very aggressive plans for vitamins going forward.","Matt Farrell","Great. And just one quick one on the acquisition announcement. Can you provide any context on maybe distribution gaps? I mean what is the real opportunity in terms of low hanging fruit with some of these brands?","Jim Craigie","No, I wouldn\u2019t say that. Lil\u2019 Drug Store is a really good operator and they had really good ACV for these. There are some of likes there, but I wouldn\u2019t be looking at these brands as having big voids to sell.","Jim Craigie","I think Nik, we kind of -- Matt kind of alluded we have another business sort of like this called Femfresh over in Europe. It has products within this line which maybe applicable to this business. And with that we\u2019d be launching additional products into these two brands.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc","Hey, thanks. Good morning and Matt, echoing the congratulations. Just actually most of the questions have been asked, just two kind of follow ups. One, I think Matt you mentioned about operating margin up 50 basis points, I just want to make sure that was for the full year, not for the fourth quarter. And I have a second question as a follow-up?","Matt Farrell","Yes, that\u2019s full year, full year \u201815.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc","Okay, great. And then I guess the last question is just on the vitamin. In the third quarter, I think you said consumption to you guys was up high single-digit. Did you say what the shipment -- your actual shipment growth was as a part of that whole personal care?","Jim Craigie","No, we don\u2019t do that. ","Matt Farrell","No, we don\u2019t do that for any brand.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc","Okay. Is it in line with what personal care or is can you say a little bit higher or little bit lower?","Jim Craigie","We don\u2019t do this for any brand. We always going to ask, but we don\u2019t go into sales and margins by brand or SPU or any that.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc","","All right. Okay, I\u2019ll leave it with that. Thanks a lot.","Matt Farrell","Thanks Jason.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Thank you. Thanks for fitting me in and Matt first congrats on your extended role. As far as my question, can we talk a little bit about the key drivers of the 3% organic sales growth for fiscal \u201815 because specialty obviously grew much faster this year? And then you mentioned earlier that\u2019s you\u2019re not going to see as many new products in 2015 and 2014. So perhaps can you talk a little bit about the spread between consumer versus specialty growth going forward? And perhaps some specifics on what\u2019s going to drive consumer to help offset the difficult comps in specialty? Thanks so much.","Matt Farrell","Yes. I would say -- just to be clear. So, it\u2019s not in the release and it\u2019s not in the script. So we haven\u2019t called the top-line for next year. So, we\u2019re not ready to call any lines. I don\u2019t think we really said is that we expect gross margin expansion and the reasons for that we\u2019re going to be the fact that we had such a huge number of new products launch this year unlike the slotting and couponing to generate trial in \u201814 that we don\u2019t expect to repeat as much next year.","I gave an example with respect to the sustainability of the SG&A costs. And in my example I said that if you assumed 3% top-line growth then you kept the lead on SG&A at only 1% or less that you could generate 25 of your 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. But we\u2019re not ready right now to be calling the three pieces; domestic, international and specialty products. But I will say that you\u2019re right with respect to lightening striking twice, when you look at the kind of year that specialty products had this year, it\u2019s certainly not obvious to us either that that will repeat next year.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Got it. Thank you.","Jim Craigie","Okay. Hey I want to thank everybody for taking the time to meet with us this morning. Again, very proud of the results this quarter and just hope things keep going well, which I think they will. Again I said earlier, we had a good October and we\u2019ve got a couple of months to go to finish the year. So, thanks again for taking the time.

(NYSE:CHD) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call February  5, 2019 12:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Matthew Farrell - President and Chief Executive Officer","Britta Bomhard - Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer","Steve Cugine - Executive Vice President, International and Global New Products Innovation","Rick Dierker - Chief Financial Officer","Paul Wood - Executive Vice President, U.S. Sales","Conference Call Participants","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Caroline Levy - Macquarie","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Matthew Farrell","Thanks for coming. We have a lot of familiar faces here today and we have got a great program planned for you. I am going to start off with the Safe Harbor statement. I encourage everybody to when you have some time take a look at it and read it. And I have a very packed agenda. Many of these topics are familiar to you, who we are, why we are winning and take you through the ARM & HAMMER brand today, also all our exciting innovation in \u201819 and then our other couple businesses, international and animal productivity. I will also talk about how we run the company and Rick will come up and talk about the financials.","So, we just wrapped up another strong year. And we entered 2019 with a lot of confidence. So, our EPS is expected to increase 7% to 9% driven by operating income growth and that is top tier in the CPG space. Our 3.5% organic sales outlook is above our evergreen model. All three businesses are healthy. In the U.S. we are enjoying strong demand for our products, we are in the right categories and we have low exposure to private label. Our international business continues to be a juggernaut and we will hear more about that today from Steve Cugine who leads our international business.","Our Specialty Products business is also setup for a good year. We have an impressive lineup of innovative products across many categories that you are going to hear about today and our ability to rapidly innovate is differentiating among CPG companies. In 2019 we are going to return to gross margin expansion as we have price and productivity programs at our backs. Our price increases have been well executed for ARM & HAMMER cat litter, baking soda and carpet deodorizers and OXICLEAN pre-wash additives. Those price increases hit the shelves late in the quarter and will benefit 2019 gross margins and the good news is the competitors are raising price in those categories as we speak. And we have other levers to bolster 2019 gross margin expansion and those include pricing in personal care categories and also an opportunity to reduce promotions in the laundry category.","So, before we get into the formal program, I want to recap a few reasons why we are a standout in consumer products. We have an evergreen model which leads to two things, consistency and financial literacy. We delivered top line and bottom line growth year after year after year. The shareholders know the model very well and so do the Church & Dwight employees, all 4,700 of us. We all know what success looks like. With only 4,700 employees, we are a lean company and we adapt to change quickly. There is no better example of that than the growth of our online sales. We succeed, because our employees are committed to our success. We have brands consumers love and today you are going to hear from Britta Bomhard, our Chief Marketing Officer, you are going to hear about ARM & HAMMER and the More Power to You campaign. The More Power to You campaign is a shining example of our brand building skills. And finally, we made good choices when it comes to acquisitions. Those choices led us to dry shampoo, hair thinning, gummy vitamins and gum health. Our acquisition experience and skills will serve us well in the future. We believe there is no better place to invest in the CPG space than Church & Dwight.","Alright. I will get into the formal program. Who we are? Well, the evergreen model is 3% top line, 8% bottom line. It\u2019s been like that for many years and will continue in the future. The way the 3% breaks out is we expect 2% from the U.S., 6% from international and 5% from Specialty Products. We have 11 power brands that are listed on the slide there and those 11 brands account for 80% of our revenues and profits. And we have a very balanced portfolio between household and personal care, household 45%, personal care 48% and Specialty Products bringing up the rear with 7%. And we also have a nice balance between premium and value, 65% premium, 35% value. And we are an acquisition platform. We have a fabulous integration track record. When we buy businesses, we grow revenue and we bring operational efficiencies and because we have a strong balance sheet, we have a lot of access to capital to do more in the future. And we have a long history of growth through acquisitions.","So what you see in that slide there is 15 years. So we went from $1.5 billion to $4.1 billion. So out of those 15 years, 12 out of the 15 years, we completed a transaction. And 10 of our 11 power brands were acquired since the year 2001. And when you have leading brands, it gives you the ability to take price. So, you read in our release that we are taking price on 30% of the portfolio and we are having discussions about other categories to add to that. And we have very clear acquisition criteria. Number one or number two brands, they need to be high growth, high margin. We are fans of asset-light businesses and we like businesses where we can leverage our existing supply chain. And finally, these brands need to have a sustainable competitive advantage. So, 11 brands today, 20 brands tomorrow. And we do operate in the land of giants. All of our competitors are far, far larger than we are. As I said earlier, we only have 4,700 employees. That gives us a huge advantage. We are a lot faster than they are. We can make decisions quicker and we adapt to change. You have heard us say before. Change is our friend. And we deliver phenomenal results to our shareholders over any period you want to pick, 1, 3, 5, or 10 years.","So, why are we winning? First is this scorecard. So here is 2018. So we have algorithm, we grow 3% top line we grew 4.3% top line 2018. The consumer business had a phenomenal year, United States 4.3%, international 7.8%. Combined that was a 5% growth rate for our consumer business in 2018. Specialty Products had a rugged year, but that\u2019s going to turn around in \u201819. Okay, we are in the right categories. We know how to grow share. Low exposure to private label and we win in e-commerce, so some stats. So here is 2015, \u201816, \u201817 and \u201818. You can see in general our categories grow about 3%. That\u2019s the underpinning for the growth in the U.S. And we know how to grow share. So this is our share scorecard. In 2018, 7 out of our 11 brands maintained or grew share. And we have low exposure to private label. So if you went and calculated what\u2019s the weighted average private label share for our categories it\u2019s around 12%. And out of those 15 categories you saw on that earlier slide, 5 of them have exposure to private label, but if you take a look at those five charts, you can see that the shares are relatively stable.","And we continue to win in e-commerce. So let\u2019s look back at 2015. 2015 we were in the basement. We had 1% of our sales online. Today we are 7%, grew 40% in 2018. So, now we are top tier in CPG when it comes to online sales. We are expecting to hit 8% in 2019. And we have lots of number one brands online. Amazon generally is about 50% of online sales for most CPG companies. It\u2019s very important class of trade. All of those products are rated there number one.","And now I want to bring up Britta to take you through the ARM & HAMMER campaign.","Britta Bomhard","Hello, everyone. As Matt just talked about, we are all about brands, consumers, love. And how we bring that to life, I want to share with you today. You have heard we have 11 power brands and I think about a year ago when I was here, I shared actually what we are doing on OXICLEAN. You might remember, it\u2019s been a whole year I know that we talked about how we activate in digital and how we do targeted marketing and predictive analytics as one of the key tools. And as you know, we are all about transparency and results. So, Matt loves to talk about our report card. So I thought I would share today the results of the year of OXICLEAN. So what you can see behind me is OXICLEAN had the highest share ever at more than 53% and we have actually grown 4x the category. So that\u2019s what great marketing can do for brands.","And today we are actually here to talk about our biggest and most exciting brand, ARM & HAMMER. And I know that I want to refresh briefly what you should know about ARM & HAMMER. It is one of the oldest brands in the United States. It was actually one of the first ones trademarked in 1905, which gives it more than 100 years. It is truly part of the American DNA. So one of my colleagues was actually in a museum in Utah and on the wagon displays of the wagons going west, there was a baking soda box, because the versatility of that product is so ingrained in American philosophy about making yourself a brighter future, but it\u2019s not only a historical brand. Even today one in two households buy an ARM & HAMMER product every year and I hope all of you are part of that and you over index. So baking soda, just to put it into few fun facts and what it actually does in America.","So, one of the first things I want to talk, we all know the juice for cookies. If you used all the baking soda last year to make cookies, you would actually get up to 688 billion chocolate chip cookies, but it\u2019s not only used for baking, you might be aware that it\u2019s used for cleaning and refreshing. So it actually filled 31 billion gallons of swimming pool water. And the third exciting usage is it also has medicinal usage. So, 300,000 patients in the U.S. rely on ARM & HAMMER baking soda to purify their blood. It is such an essential product for this nation. And obviously, the one you should all be most familiar with is half of fridges in the U.S. are actually kept fresh with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. And in case you missed yours, there is a few baking soda to grab on the tables, remember to refresh every 30 days. It\u2019s not only baking soda. In other categories, it is such a key brand in this country. So if we put all our laundry together and only wash white T-shirts, we would actually get 62.5 billion pounds of laundry. Now I know that\u2019s a hard number to imagine, so I thought I would give you an easier one to imagine, how many elephants would that be? 6.5 million adult elephants. Now, I know you all imagine adult elephants everyday, so I thought maybe you just imagine the whole of Manhattan Island covered with elephants. That\u2019s about how much laundry is done with ARM & HAMMER laundry every year.","So needless to say, it\u2019s our $1 billion brand, our biggest and our crown jewel, so I think we are very excited to share how we keep this iconic brand going to work in the future. In the past, we have been very much communicating about the benefits and how it is better and the superiority of the product, but we are actually leaning in much more on connecting with our consumers in an emotional way, because we are all as I said about brands, consumers, love. So a new campaign which you hopefully at least saw coming in or experienced somewhere here is called More Power To You. And even if I call it a campaign, you really should think about a unifying creative idea, which is going to go and last us for years towards the future. So, what\u2019s the base idea behind More Power To You? Well, no brand would exist today without the love of the consumers and what we are celebrating is actually the true power for ARM & HAMMER is the ingenuity of the people using it. So, we are elevating our consumers to the heart, because they are the ones, which make this brand great.","So, let me talk you through what that feels like and what\u2019s the emotion around it. So if you can laugh over spilled milk, More Power To You. If you work a 60-hour week and still get the kids to school looking fresh, More Power To You. If things get gross and nasty, don\u2019t panic, you have the tools to make it right, More Power To You. That\u2019s why we created powerful products stacked with solutions to tackle everyday\u2019s challenges with strength and a smile, More Power To You. Now I know this is probably not your usual what you see, but I think I want to show to you how our consumers took to this in a big event where we launched the campaign here in Bryant Park. And we asked our consumers what they were thinking about ARM & HAMMER. So, let\u2019s go to the first video.","[Video Presentation]","So I think the video gives you a little bit of a flavor what this experience of experiencing ARM & HAMMER is like. But actually, I think when we say we celebrate the ingenuity of our consumers, they are our celebrities and where would you find celebrities, obviously, in People Magazine. So we highlighted our consumers as our celebrities in an edition in People Magazine in January to just show how important they are to us. So everybody you see here are real consumers as everybody you see on the wall here or as you see on the banner outside. But not only did we celebrate them, we invited them to share their experiences of baking soda, so they are telling the world about their unique experience or how they use it and we are amplifying that in our media.","And more than that, we make it even easier to connect with ARM & HAMMER. So if you want to connect today, we will have QR codes on our products, which lead you immediately to either the usages or participation in the campaign. And if you haven\u2019t had yet the opportunity to test it, you will see on the right all these banners with QR codes, so an easier way for you to get that experience yourself. That will allow us to tell this rich ARM & HAMMER story in such a bigger way than just a couple of lines on the packaging. If you remember, there is more than 101 usages for baking soda. No box will ever be big enough to print all of them. So, these new medias are God sent for us to actually invite people into the ARM & HAMMER brand and educate even more.","So with that, somebody asked me earlier, we will have about 40% of our ARM & HAMMER spend on digital, because we find that it\u2019s a fantastic tool to interact in a two-way communication with our consumers as well as make sure we target them the right way. But we also and I want to show you similar to what I showed in OXICLEAN a year ago, how this campaign ladders up for different target groups on the example of laundry. And hold your breath because nobody else has seen these campaigns yet, so you are the first one. So I want to show you the versatility of this creative idea with three very differently targeted executions for laundry. Let\u2019s start with the first one.","[Video Presentation]","So if you have sensitive skin like me, you know this yucky feeling. I think this is a great visualization of what this looks like. So, this is clearly in the direction of elevating a benefit. But we also know that a lot of Americans are actually strapped for money and so we also know that we are one of the best value brands out there to doing your laundry. So we actually target those people with a different message, which I want to show to you now.","[Video Presentation]","So I think those two executions already show how versatile this campaign is. And we also have more emotional executions, particularly for those of you in the room who are parents you know what the strain of parenting can be. So I hope you enjoy the next campaign, which actually leads into that emotion of bringing up the family. Video?","[Video Presentation]","So I think you have experienced now the ability of this campaign all laddering up to More Power To You in targeting very different segments of laundry users. But as you know, ARM & HAMMER is much broader. It\u2019s one of the brands with most different aisles in the U.S. So, we also have cat litter. So you might wonder how we bring this to life in cat litter and you are in for a treat.","[Video Presentation]","So it sounds like we have couple of pet parents in the room. So as you know, pets are often today are kind of treated as persons and children. So, I think by personifying the cat, that actually gave great emotional resonance, so we have excellent test results in that commercial. And as you can see here, it\u2019s a unique way and we can own and breakthrough to a lot of boring cat litter communication. So I think it\u2019s a very unique way for us to communicate and own a message in that category. So nothing works like experiencing a campaign. Instead of me telling you about it, I think what you want to do is be part of it. And as you haven\u2019t yet, we have a box setup there to get your picture taken and know what it\u2019s like to be part of the ARM & HAMMER community, because obviously, there is More Power To You. So thank you very much and join us on that campaign.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Thank you, Britta. Now we have got some really exciting things to talk about. I mentioned earlier that we have quite a scale as an innovator in CPG and I think this little show here is going to give you a real pace of the breadth of the innovation that we have in 2019.","We will start off with Waterpik Sonic-Fusion. So we have the world\u2019s first flossing toothbrush. Now you can brush and floss at the same time and only 16% of American adults floss daily. And this is clinically proven to be twice as effective as traditional brushing and flossing. So, this is a fabulous new product. And there is a lot of science behind this. So I am going to roll a couple of minutes here. So everybody can appreciate the design behind this product.","[Video Presentation]","Okay, gang. Everybody run out there and buy one today. Alright, next up is OXICLEAN. So we all know OXICLEAN for its whitening powers. But now we are launching OXICLEAN Dark Protect. So this is directed towards dark and black fabrics. So 42% of our wash loads are dark loads. So we are bringing anti-fade technology to OXICLEAN and it includes OXICLEAN Stain Fighters, it\u2019s cold water soluble. This keeps dark and black fabrics looking newer. And we are also bringing that technology to value detergent. So, ARM & HAMMER plus OXICLEAN Fade Defense. This is for vibrant whites and bright colors. So, color fading is the number two laundry frustration. So this is a new benefit, Fade Defense that we are bringing to the value detergent category.","Litter, so we have ARM & HAMMER Cloud Control, so you can breathe easy. If you are a cat owner, you know there is a cloud of nasties when you are emptying the litter pad. Now you can breathe easy with no cloud of nasties when cleaning the litter box. So this is dust-free, it\u2019s got dandruff control technology, and an allergy-free light scent and we still have our 7-day odor-control guarantee. In vitamins, we are coming out both for VITAFUSION and Li\u2019l Critters with organic vitamins, USDA organic. So a couple of proof points here, 50% of Americans now consume organic products at least occasionally. And millennials, more than half of millennials prefer supplements derived from organic sources. So we are giving consumers more of what they want and less of what they don\u2019t want. So we all know that facial masks are the rage. So, NAIR is coming out with a NAIR leg mask. This is the first mask for legs that not only beautifies skin, but also removes hair. So when you ask facial mask users, 86% are interested in purchasing or using a mask for legs. We think we have a great insight here. We are going to run an ad right now so you can get a better appreciation for this.","[Video Presentation]","Okay, next would be oral care. So we are coming out with ORAJEL toothache strips. So we have patent pending on this particular product. This is where you are going to get targeted long lasting pain from strips that you apply to your toothache. Our strips stay in place for targeted relief, they dissolve slowly for long lasting relief and a cool mint taste. So, this is really a revolution for oral analgesics.","BATISTE. BATISTE is a fast growing brand for us globally. We have two new variants coming out this year, one is a hydrating dry shampoo, the other one is volumizing. So a couple of proof points here. So, 80% of women don\u2019t wash their hair everyday and only 24% are currently using dry shampoo. So, why is that? Well, it\u2019s because some of them think it\u2019s not for their hair type. So, we have a hydrating dry shampoo for dry hair with moisturizing avocado and volumizing dry shampoo for fine hair with plumping hair collagen. So, these are going to be two winners in 2019. It wouldn\u2019t be an Analyst Day without TROJAN. So here is the TROJAN Edge, take pleasure to the limit. This is with lubricants to change sensations. Gen Z as we all know places a lot of value on experience, adventure and living boldly and to reach that crowd, we have a new TROJAN man.","[Video Presentation]","And no one in this room is in the target group, so you haven\u2019t seen any of the digital ads, but I encourage you to look for them. Okay. Now, I am going to bring up Steven Cugine to take us through the international story.","Steve Cugine","Well, it certainly is a big sexy world. So I guess that\u2019s why I am up next to talk about the international story. As Matt said, I think everybody is familiar with our evergreen target international at 6%, but I thought I would give a little color here on international. For the last several years, we have been focusing on building scale. As you can see in 2013, we were $430 million in sales and we exit 2018 with $710 million in sales. Not only have we increased scale to the point where we believe we can really have access to every major market around the world, we have doubled our organic growth on a much larger base from 3% to almost 8% and exiting 2018 at 7.8%. When we started this journey, we started really implementing our new strategies in 2014. We saw the fruits of that labor by Q4 and you could see from every year from 2015 to 2018, we have exceeded our 6% evergreen growth target exiting 2018 at 7.8%. Even better news is we had a very strong quarter finishing Q4 at 9%. So, we leave 2018 with a lot of momentum.","The net sales composition for international is really 8% Mexico and Australia; 23% Europe, which is made up of three subsidiaries, France, UK, Germany; Canada at 31%; and total export or our global markets at 28%. Breaking that down for 2018 even further, our subsidiaries delivered a solid 4.3% organic growth and export continues to deliver strong double-digit growth every year. As we look forward and we say where is the engine of growth coming from? And what is the fuel for that growth? In our subsidiary markets that now exceed $0.5 billion in sales we focus growth in three areas one, brand expansion, that\u2019s expanding the offerings of the brands that we offer today like OXICLEAN Ultra Gel entry in Mexico, where we entered the liquid segment; VMS expansion and of course, BATISTE, Matt talked about the great new products, but we are also expanding in new subsidiary markets.","Last year, I talked about how excited I was about the acquisitions that we recently made and that I thought Waterpik represented a real engine of growth, not only for the company domestically, but for our international business. Now I am happy to say that international delivered 20% growth in the Waterpik business in 2018 versus year ago. Lastly, pricing, so in 2018, we have initiated pricing actions over a third of our products that we sell in our international markets and we will reap the benefits of that initiative in 2019. Another example for growth for the future is Asia. Last year when I was here I talked about a spotlight on Asia, both Southeast Asia and China and I am pleased to be here today to say that our sales exceeded $90 million in these markets in 2018. That is up from $25 million in 2013. This is enabled by a new relationship that we started in 2018 with DKSH, a partner of ours covering all of Southeast Asia. This year, we are implementing an initiative to really drive and expand our distribution in all of these markets through this partner.","Another exciting development is China. I personally spent almost 2 years in studying the China market and doing consumer research in every major city in China on our brands, identified those brands, took that research and identified partners that would really expand the China opportunity for Church & Dwight, but there are several characteristics that were very important. We needed a company that had certainly the traditional distribution access into retail, because it\u2019s certainly a big part of the China market, but also had already developed a strong capability on e-commerce. This is something that even local Chinese companies are struggling with in terms of the dynamic change in this marketplace. So, we identified Shanghai Jahwa, which is a strong personal care, CPG company, $1 billion in size, publicly traded company, to be our partner in this market we spend a lot of time with them getting to know them and ultimately negotiating a very unique agreement, which gives us both transparency and access to the online and offline markets in China.","Beyond this, I\u2019m excited about the capabilities that we\u2019re building to drive long-term growth in our international markets. We have established local teams in Shanghai and in Taiwan. In Shanghai, our employees of Church & Dwight are actually embedded with and live and work with the Jahwa employees in their corporate offices. So, they\u2019re really fully integrated into the Jahwa team to support sales, marketing, and operations and distribution in the China market. We doubled our staff in Singapore and Panama. So, we\u2019re investing in the markets where we see the fastest growth. We built a DTC capability in Europe and Australia. As you know, we launched a new subsidiary in Germany last year, and that\u2019s off to a fast start. We\u2019re also committed to brand building, both in our developed subsidiary markets as well as in our export markets. And so, we have customized talent for each market and I just I\u2019m going to share with you a brief snippet of some of our assets.","[Video Presentation]","Okay. So last slide, we are committed, certainly myself and the international team, to deliver at 6% or more for international organic growth, and I\u2019m pleased to put this slide up in particular because it is the identical slide that I ended with last year because what was true then remains true today. Our existing brands still have a lot of runway and we look at Batiste and its growth in the international markets, ARM & HAMMER baking soda and ARM & HAMMER related products that were premiering today continue to deliver strong organic growth in our international markets.","Our acquired brands are building strength too. As I mentioned Waterpik growing 20% in 2018. Our export business has been and will continue to deliver double-digit growth. We\u2019re making significant investments in Southeast Asia and China, and that will fuel growth for years to come. So, it is certainly a big sexy world out there, and I\u2019m pleased to represent Church & Dwight\u2019s international business. Matt, back to you.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Animal Productivity, so we have a 5% algorithm here. Remember we said that the Company grows 3%, U.S. is 2%, international 6% as Steve just took you through, and Specialty Products 5%. So, you might think, hey, that\u2019s kind of a big number considering that we went backwards in 2018 minus the 3.4%. Here\u2019s how that 5% breaks out. So, we have a bulk chemical business. That\u2019s essentially bulk sodium bicarbonate. It\u2019s a real steady-Eddie business. Animal Productivity is the one that we expect to grow at 6%. Two-thirds of the businesses is Animal Productivity; one-third is bulk chemicals. Now the Animal Productivity part of the business is the one that\u2019s been most volatile and the most cyclical over time. The reason we like being in that space is just because of this statistic is there\u2019s 7.5 billion people on the planet today; going to 10 billion by 2015. So, animals have to be more productive.","If you went back to the 1970s, that\u2019s when we first got into the dairy business. Essentially baking soda was Alka-Seltzer for cows. They could pretty much eat more and more grass. From there we moved into nutritional supplements, still in dairy. And then 3 years ago we decided we have a great brand in ARM & HAMMER. We can move into other species; that will be cattle, swine, and poultry. So first we bought into pre-biotics, then we bought into probiotics. So now today, 2018, 24% of the business is non-dairy and growing. This is good for us going forward. Second thing is that 13% of the business is now international. So, the population growth is outside the U.S. That\u2019s where we need to be. So, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the last three years and that\u2019s what gives us confidence in the 5% top line long-term.","So just as Steve said, the same slide this year as last year. We have a great brand. All of these products are labeled ARM & HAMMER. The consumer trend is away from antibiotics. So, we make prebiotics, probiotics, and nutritional supplements. And we\u2019re not wedded to dairy anymore. We\u2019ve moved into other species, and the global growth and the growth of population is going to help us. So, this is going to be a winner for us, and this business has terrific financials.","Alright. Then how we run the company? First off, you heard from Britta today, we have number one brands we have brands that consumers love. We also are friend of the environment. We leverage people. We have highly productive people and we want Church & Dwight to be a place where people matter. And we leverage our assets heavily. And if you do all four of those well, you get really good returns. But because we are an acquisition platform, we deliver great shareholder returns. If you look at how we\u2019re incented, it\u2019s very simple; net revenue, gross margin, cash from operations, and EPS, 25% each and all 4,700 employees understand it. I want to particular gross margin is 25% of all employees\u2019 annual bonus. If you look at our numbers for 2018, you know we\u2019re pretty sad about that. So we\u2019re going to turn that around in 2019.","These are the four ways we do it. So good to great cost optimization. That\u2019s our continuous improvement program. We have supply chain optimization as well with our plants. New products we have accretive new products. All these products you saw today are premium priced and acquisition synergies. And with respect to being, a friend of the environment, in the early 1900s, we started to use recycled paperboard in our packages. In the 1970s we were the only sponsor of the first Earth Day. We were the company that took phosphates out of laundry detergent in the 1970s. And more recently, in 2018, a 100% of our electricity globally comes from renewable sources of wind and solar. And we planted 3 million trees through the Arbor Day Foundation last year. Why do you plant trees, because trees take CO2 out of the atmosphere.","So, we have three goals. One of them is we want to reduce the use of water by 25% by 2022 that\u2019s water. Second is solid waste recycling. We want to move from 67% to 75%. And here is the big one. We intend to be carbon-neutral by 2025, and today we are 55% carbon-neutral. What does that mean? That means we take out of the atmosphere a little bit more half of what we put in the CO2. And we\u2019ve been getting recognized for that; Barron\u2019s, Forbes, FTSE, the EPA, Drucker Institute WSJ Management Top 250, all of them recognizing the efforts we\u2019re putting into this. Alright. Now financials from Rick, come on up.","Rick Dierker","Okay. Alright. Thanks, Matt. I am going to go through three things, look at the 2018 results, quarter, full year, talking about the outlook, and will start with evergreen model like we always do.","So just as a reminder and we have been doing this for over 10 years, but organic net sales growth of 3% is kind of our algorithm, 25 basis points from gross margin, flat marketing, higher dollars of course, and then leverage SG&A by 25 basis points to get to the 50 basis points on operating margin, which translates into 8% EPS growth. I\u2019m sure all of you guys can tell me the same thing.","And as Matt alluded to earlier, it breaks out by division, 2% domestic, 6% international, and 5% for SPD. So, Q4 highlights; 4.3% organic growth in the quarter, which is really strong top line performance. Our outlook was 3%, domestic was 4%, international was 9%, and SPD went backwards by around 4%, consumer organic also almost a 5% grower. Adjusted gross margin; now this is where we\u2019ve had a lot of conversation. Our full-year outlook was down 120 basis points that implied down 160 basis points. In the quarter we finished down 250 basis points in the quarter. So, what happened? Three things; first of all, there was a mix impact of about 40 to 50 basis points. Our household business grew faster than we expected. Our personal care business, excluding Waterpik, grew a little bit slower than we expected. And so that was one. Number two was tariffs, so the timing of tariffs, right. As our Waterpik business grew faster, we thought that tariff impact was going to really hit \u201819. It got pulled forward into 2018 and then the third thing was on gross margin. We really blew the doors off of cash from an incentive comp perspective. We missed on margin, but we really blew the doors off the cash flow, free cash flow conversion. We\u2019ll get to that in a minute and so gross margin has an impact. Incentive comp has an impact on gross margin.","Marketing was up 10 basis points. So, we invested $5 million or $6 million year-over-year in marketing really to start the year with momentum, which is actually happening, right. I think Nielsen information came out today, plus 6% on consumption growth, so really starting off the year strong and EPS was up 10%. So for the quarter 3.8%, 4.4%, 4.7% and 4.3%, so just really strong broad-based growth across the year, on a stacked basis, the second half of the year was around 8%, alright, so just growth on top of growth.","This is probably the most important slide or one of them in the deck. This is our progression on price\/mix. Remember organic has two components. One is volume growth and one is price\/mix growth. And for a long time, we were bumping along in the negative price\/mix growth, for about a 1.5 year. In Q3 we inflected, right. And lower promotional spending, especially in laundry, and positive price\/mix happened in Q3, happened again in Q4. Now remember in Q4 list price changes that we\u2019ve gone to retail with aren\u2019t even in these numbers yet, right, because it takes it typically protects a month or two months or even three months sometimes retail pricing, and so really that benefits on the come in Q1 and for 2019.","I already walked through the details of Q4, but I\u2019ll just recap gross margin for the full year. So plus 20 basis points on volume, price\/mix, down 170 basis points for commodities and transportation, and we\u2019ve talked many times about the headwinds on commodities, whether it\u2019s resin, oil, diesel, surfactants, the headwinds in the industry on transportation, and we\u2019ll talk little bit more about that in 2019 outlook area. And then other manufacturing costs, whether it\u2019s tariffs or incentive comp or labor increases. Productivity program was plus 80 basis points and then FX and acquisitions was, really immaterial, so that\u2019s down 140 basis points for the year. For the full year 4.3% growth, down 140 basis points for gross margin. We just spoke about that. Marketing was strong, 11.7%. SG&A was a good baseline of 13.6%. EPS was 17%. And I think too many times we look past our EPS growth. So, 17% EPS growth, and yes, we had some tax reform benefit in there. Our peer average was about 5.5% apples-to-apples. So, we\u2019re just we feel like we\u2019re top tier performance here. Cash from operations was $763 million and free cash flow conversion was 124%. You\u2019ll see in our slides later on cash, the peer average is 91% on free cash flow conversion. So, just doing a great job of converting those sales and earnings into cash.","Okay. Moving to the outlook, so 3.5% organic sales. This is the highest organic sales outlook we\u2019ve given since 2014. Gross margin is expanding 10 basis points. Excluding tariffs, it\u2019s up 35 basis points. And I\u2019ll walk you through that detail in a minute. Marketing is down 10 basis points, but that\u2019s really just math. Our SPD growth is around 9% for next year. We, don\u2019t advertise to the dairy industry that much or to cows. So, it doesn\u2019t have much marketing. So, it\u2019s just math. Our marketing dollars are up year-over-year. SG&A is down 30 basis points as we leverage pretty much in line with the operating model and 50 basis points expansion for operating margin, 21% effective tax rate. So, 2018 we were at 21%. In 2019 we\u2019re at 21%. That\u2019s two things; one is stock option exercises and the other one is favorable tax matter internationally. But the good news is its flat year-over-year and so that means what does that mean? It means our EPS growth is all operating in 2019.","Cash from operations is around $800 million is our outlook. So again, really just strong free cash flow conversion. And it\u2019s not on the page, but the assumption for buyback is about $300 million, $100 million of which we\u2019ve already done. And, of course, if we do an acquisition, we would probably dial that back and just focus on using that money for M&A. Here\u2019s the detail for the organic sales outlook, 2.5% domestic, international was 6%, SPD was 9%, that\u2019s how we get to 3.5% as a baseline.","Okay. I want to spend a minute on this slide. This is gross margin expansion in 2019. This is the key part of our story in \u201819. Really two things to call your attention to, in 2018 we are only plus 20 basis points for price, volume, mix. In 2019 the net benefit of price, volume, mix is 125 basis points, so this is plus 100 basis points largely because of the retail price increases. The other thing I will call your attention to is inflation. So it was a 250 basis point headwind in 2018. It\u2019s another headwind in 2019, although not as much, 190 basis points. I think there is a false narrative out there about commodities and how quickly they came down and the \u2013 maybe favorability that they are throwing off.","As an example, in Q3 to Q4 oil was down about 30%. A couple of key commodities that we had diesel, resin, surfactants, they were down 4%, 7% and 13%. And so it takes a while and you have heard this from many of our peer set. It takes three months, six months, nine months for oil to be down for the rest of the inputs to really fall at the same rate. The good news though is what Matt alluded to is we have certain pricing actions, those four that Matt already talked about embedded in our outlook, but there are other pricing actions for personal care items that we are working on and that would be in addition to our outlook. Productivity programs is plus 100, we are making great traction on our good to great program and then the tariff impact is minus 25 basis points. So remember, we have talked about this briefly, but we price to protect profit dollars and not margin. So that\u2019s largely the Waterpik tariff impact. And while we are protected from a profit dollar perspective, it still has an impact on margin. And so net-net we had a 10 basis point increase from a \u2013 on a reported basis and then if you add back the tariffs, we are at plus 35 basis points. So we feel really good about margin expansion for 2019. And here is some color on some of the key P&L items. So organic growth, we have had a great track record of organic growth and we are ahead of our evergreen model in \u201819 at 3.5%. Gross margin, I just went through that in detail. This is a hallmark of the company and Matt told you how much it\u2019s important to the entire company, 25% of our incentive comp is tied to gross margin. Nobody else in the industry really does that.","Marketing spend, we are still in the top 20 advertiser in the U.S. and dollars were up. And it\u2019s essentially flat year-over-year. SG&A management, this is a great baseline for us we are leveraging back down to 13.3% in 2019. Now if you exclude amortization, a few years it looked like we are building SG&A. That was really tied to some of those smaller deals we are doing and all the amortization that we are throwing off. So if you take a step back, you can see the trends pretty flat over time. We have had great adjusted EPS growth over the last few years and we expect \u201819 to be no different. So 7% to 9% EPS growth in 2019, which is top tier in the industry again. I think the peer group when we did a list of about nine or ten peers, on average it was around 1% or 2%, okay. Strong margin expansion over time, gross margin matters for this company. Gross margin drives EBITDA margin. EBITDA margin drives cash flow, we believe that drives valuation. So just a great progress on and we expect more to come.","Free cash flow conversion, this is my favorite slide, 124% for Church & Dwight, peer average is 91%, lot of companies target 100%. And we do that a few different ways, but one of them is working capital management. We have gone from 52 day cash conversion cycle all the way down to 20 days. And we have a very strong balance sheet. We ended the year about 2.2x levered, we will be sub-2x in 2019. And what does that mean, well, especially when we are under-levered, capital allocation is very important. But number one far and away is M&A. Number two is debt reduction because it enables number one. Number three is new product development. Number four is CapEx. Number five is return cash to shareholders. So we have a lot of firepower, $2.5 billion is our math and we can maintain our investment grade rating. And we are not a capital intensive company. We are about 2x or sub-2x typically on CapEx. We have announced a 5% dividend increase in 2019. This is strong track record of dividend increases and we have been paying one for 118 years. And I think Bill Chappell had to leave, but this slide was specifically for Bill because he came in late a couple of years ago. Our TSR is 20% over 10 years. It\u2019s about 18% over the 3-year and 5-year horizon and it was 33% in 2018.","And with that, I think we have a public service announcement before we start our Q&A.","[Video Presentation]","Alright, so I am going to invite up the rest of management team and we will go through our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Matthew Farrell","Okay. We have got the whole squad coming up here, every function is represented. There would be chance to pepper us with questions, so we got a microphone for the crowd.","Rick Dierker","Yes.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Joe Altobello.","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Couple of questions on gross margin, I guess first for Rick, can you walk us through why the cash flow over-delivery was a drag to gross margin in the fourth quarter?","Rick Dierker","Yes, sure. The question is why is cash flow over-delivery from an incentive comp perspective a drag to gross margin rate, right. Well, we have 4,700 employees, two-thirds of whom are at the manufacturing facilities all over the world. And so when you do incentive comp or salaries, that goes through direct labor or overheads at the plants. And so increases in compensation flow through the gross margin line as part of COGS, so that\u2019s why.","Joe Altobello","Got it. And secondly in terms of the \u201819 outlook for gross margin, what level of promotion activity you are expecting, is it going to get better than it was this year or worse than it was this year or pretty much equal?","Matthew Farrell","Yes. One of the things I have said upfront is that we see an opportunity to reduce promotional spending in the laundry category. If you looked at two big household categories right now, so if you looked at laundry detergent and litter and you looked at the last six quarters, you see that the fourth quarter was the lowest quarter in 1.5 year. Unilaterally we think because the strength of our brands and the strength of the consumer that we can go further.","Joe Altobello","Okay. Thank you.","Matthew Farrell","Kevin?","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. My question is on the international business, how big can the China opportunity be, what\u2019s potentially the role of M&A with respect to that growth strategy. And then lastly, touching on that with the guidance that was the one segment where you are guiding in line with the evergreen target, but it seems like this would be a year with the \u2013 with your alliance Jahwa coming on where maybe we would see above sort of evergreen target growth, but that\u2019s not at least initially anticipated in the outlook, so maybe you could touch on that as well? Thank you.","Matthew Farrell","It\u2019s never enough, Kevin is it. We have got a 6% algorithm. We said we are going to hit the 6%, but\u2026","Kevin Grundy","[Question Inaudible]","Matthew Farrell","Yes, okay, alright. Well, I am very curious to hear what Steve has to say about how big the international business can be particularly in China.","Steve Cugine","Okay. So put it in perspective, right. So outside the U.S. for Procter, China is the number two largest country. For us, it represents about 1% of total sales. So it\u2019s a very significant opportunity for us. So we believe that we are putting in the foundation for what I think is a decade, maybe two decades worth of growth, right. To maintain a 6% plus algorithm, you are going to need to have some large markets contributing for a long period of time. So how big can it be, I think it can be pretty big, but I won\u2019t put a number on it today. We are just starting with Jahwa as of Q1 in \u201819, so we would like to get a little momentum under our belt. Your second question was on why only 6% growth and I would say there is two reasons for that. First is that we are investing both in Southeast Asia and in China, right, particularly in terms of expanding distribution. That is a net negative against organic sales. If we looked at a unit basis, we think there would be faster growth, but we are really ceding that for 2020 and beyond, that\u2019s number one. And number two we are being just a little cautious as it relates to Brexit. So we have a large manufacturing plant in the Southern UK that supports a lot of our international personal care brands.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Jason.","Jason English","Thank you for the question. Two quick questions, first on cadence to gross margins, obviously we finished on a slightly softer note, can you give us any directional indication of what the shape of it may look like throughout next year? And then second question, I will just plow them both in now. Can you update us on your M&A ambitions? I know a lot of observers of Church & Dwight had a sense that there maybe acquisitions coming sort of late last year. Clearly, we are into the next year and nothing has happened. Is there reason to have a heightened sense of anticipation that there is something happening sometime in the near-term?","Matthew Farrell","I am going to let our attorney answer that second question. So I will take the second question first. So you know that there is no property that is sold in the United States without us being aware of it. So any book that\u2019s floating around, we have it. So we look at everything that comes to market, but we never tip our hand with respect to what we are going to hunt for or if something is imminent. But rest assured, we are very busy looking at opportunities, so that\u2019s as far as we can go. Patrick, are you good with that? Alright.","Rick Dierker","And then your second question on gross margin just the curve, largely because of commodities it\u2019s, I\u2019d say, first half, second half. So the first half will have to be down on gross margin, the second half will be up on gross margin, because of the timing on commodities.","Matthew Farrell","Okay.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you. So, following up on a question on guidance and a question on international for Steve, on the guidance 2.5% consumer domestic growth, your commentary was very bullish on pricing and optimistic on lower promotion, some of that 2.5% price mix versus volume, should we expect that to be skewed significantly more towards price mix? If so, how do we square that and the flat A&P against the backdrop where just a couple of your competitors, Henkel and Colgate are reinvesting pretty significantly? Maybe not all the funds in the U.S. market in your categories, but they are investing. P&G is not relenting. So is your spending outlook enough and the price mix optimism, how do you square that with the investment backdrop competitively? Secondly...","Matthew Farrell","Do you want to pause there and let us answer that?","Unidentified Analyst","Sure.","Matthew Farrell","So one of your questions is we have some competitors talking in high-pitched voices about they are going to be investing more money, whether it\u2019s P&G or Colgate or Henkel. We don\u2019t view this as something new. These guys have been spending lots of money the last few years. So I don\u2019t look at this as a sea change. So Henkel, for example, yes, they bought a business a few years ago and they got bigger in the U.S. Obviously, they want to make a big splash into premium laundry and they have with Persil. They have less than a 3% share today. They do have other brands in the mid-tier and in value, but we have been winning in value for the last 2 years and it\u2019s not from them lack of trying. Our share of laundry today is 15%. 2 years ago, it was 14.1%. So we have had huge growth in the last 2 years and it\u2019s defined everyday. So we don\u2019t really view this as something we got to sweat. If you go back to Henkel and mid-tier, one of their brands is all. Two-thirds of all is a sensitive skin consumer. That\u2019s not the lion\u2019s share of our brands. So obviously, it\u2019s something we are going to watch. I would imagine OXICLEAN liquid laundry will get knocked around a little bit up in the premium tier, because of average for Persil, but that\u2019s not something that we think is going to influence our 2019 results.","Rick Dierker","And I would just add to your question on volume versus price mix, probably two-thirds price mix and one-third volume is a good kind of general direction. And then in terms of why you are growing faster is kind of the crux of the outlook on revenue. And 3.5%, we think is a great number relative not just to our history, but also relative to the peer set. We are not going to go lead with a 4% growth when the rest of peers are growing 2%. So is there conservatism, maybe but 3.5% feels right at this point in time.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. This one will be quicker. Just on the international horizon, thinking long-term, at what point you are leading with a lot of export-led, distributor-led growth, at what point, as you realize that, do you foresee organically you need to step up like cash investment in those markets to really build your own infrastructure versus going on the back of distributors? Is that something that\u2019s within a 5-year time horizon or is it going to be just more even keel as you go forward?","Steve Cugine","Yes. Today, I would say Church & Dwight is 82% sales in the United States, right. We have a big world and that\u2019s why I was joking. I don\u2019t know who put the TROJAN spot in before me, but I really do believe passionately that we have a lot of runway for growth before we really need to put in kind of big assets. And the big assets are usually around SG&A frankly if you\u2019re going to go direct, and we have a model that we prescribe in terms of the size of the business and the percent of SG&A required to make that math work. It works in Germany, but \u2013 and that\u2019s really just because there are a few large customers. So, the SG&A as a percentage of sales makes the math work. In other countries like China, we said we\u2019re never going to be able to get to the scale that would be required that say P&G has been able to do over decades of time. So, we\u2019re taking that partner route and we\u2019re going to do that in most of our markets. But what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re attacking that market through a brand building partnership approach for large markets. And in that case, we see that playing out for years to come. So even in the 5-year timeframe, I think we have a lot of runway in the current model that we have structured so far.","Rick Dierker","I would just add to that, it\u2019s also a pay-as-you-go model. I mean, these guys are doing a great job. We\u2019re not calling out of our EPS or investment like we\u2019re spending millions of dollars in China, that we spent millions of dollars going direct in Germany. That\u2019s embedded in our outlook of 7% to 9%.","Matthew Farrell","Let\u2019s stay with the same table.","Olivia Tong","Thanks, Matt. Appreciate it. Wanted to talk about pricing. The 30% of the business that you\u2019re planning to price on, are those price plans already in market? If not, when are they coming? And then also are your peers, have they announced their pricing plans? And just on gross margin, mix, tariff, these are kinds of things I think that they\u2019ll continue. So, why does it get better from here?","Matthew Farrell","Yes. So, with respect to pricing, when we say 30% of the portfolio is price that\u2019s across all three businesses. It\u2019s U.S., International, and also Specialty Products. Within Specialty Products, it\u2019s the bulk sodium bicarbonate driven by rises in soda ash. As far as announcements go, yes, they have been announced. The 30% has been announced globally, and one of your questions was have competitors moved in the U.S., the 30% they all moved. So, it\u2019s still early days. This is just a measure of price elasticity, but we\u2019ll be watching out over the next 3 months to 6 months.","Rick Dierker","Maybe you want to \u2013 Paul, do you want to comment on just the volume elasticities in just early days?","Paul Wood","Everything \u2013 generically speaking it\u2019s always tough to take price anywhere, but those are progressing as expected and similar to Matt\u2019s. The price elasticity, the volume, mix that we put on has been positive. As expected, we\u2019re making progress. So, we\u2019re going into this \u2013 these are always tough conversations, but I think no surprises and going exactly as we expected and planned.","Rick Dierker","Yes, great. And then, Olivia, your second question was on gross margin and mix continues and tariffs continue. I already talked about tariffs, right. Tariffs are implicitly in there, but we\u2019ve already priced those. Those prices are effective already. And so from a profit dollar perspective, we\u2019re protected, right. If those roll back then great. From a mix perspective, this was a year that we just missed gross margin in a big way, right. I was here a year ago and I told we were going to be flat and then commodities came in a big way, transportation came in a big way, and mix came in a way. So, we planned 2019 a little more conservatively from a mix perspective. So, I feel pretty good up here in February talking about it.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And then if I could just pivot over to SG&A, obviously that\u2019s a big bucket of your operating margin delivery for 2019. And SG&A has actually been going up as a percentage of sales the last couple of years. Obviously, last year you got the tax benefit that you put back into the business, but what\u2019s going to drive that SG&A improvement for 2019?","Rick Dierker","Good question. Three things, one, and this is just consistent with our evergreen model. I\u2019ve said it many times. If we can grow our SG&A dollars at half the rate, we can \u2013 we grow our top-line. That\u2019s worth about 15 basis points, okay? We\u2019ve done the math there many times. We get about 15 basis points again just from incentive comp, right. Again, we really blew the doors off the cash, and so that is going to be a benefit year-over-year in 2019. And then the third thing, we\u2019re really \u2013 working really hard on systems and automation, whether it\u2019s the quality system, whether it\u2019s our PLM system for R&D, our SAP system or whatnot. All these systems that we put in place so that we don\u2019t have to add people that we get more effective and efficient that way. So those are the three reasons.","Matthew Farrell","So, here\u2019s a fun fact. So, we have just about the same number of employees on December 31, 2018 as December 31, 2017. And we expect to be the same way December 31, 2019. So, we\u2019re a really lean shop. And one of the beauties of that is it forces the Company to prioritize. We can\u2019t do everything. So, we just focus on high-value activities. Who\u2019s next? Let\u2019s come forward here.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. So, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the Nielsen data. For the first time actually the fourth quarter kind of tracked the Nielsen data and usually you would be \u2013 we are aspired to see you\u2019re growing faster than that. So, I was wondering, if there is an indication of like the gains that you had in distribution in off-track channel kind of like easing off? And kind of related to that also, Amazon, you mentioned that 50% of your e-commerce now is through Amazon, which does make sense in terms of like share. But like there\u2019s a lot of sampling talks about Amazon asking for more support from the manufacturers. So, I wonder if embedded in your guidance there is also some investment within e-commerce?","Rick Dierker","Yes, I\u2019ll take the first one. So, the question is organic versus what Nielsen would say. So, I think organic for us is 4% for consumer domestic, Nielsen was 3.9%. And you\u2019re right, typically we\u2019ve had around, I don\u2019t know, 100 basis points of a tailwind from untracked channels, whether that\u2019s online or club. It was 150 basis points this quarter, so that 4% \u2013 3.9% plus 150, right, becomes 5.40% 15 [ph] and then we had incremental couponing that was already in place 6 months ago for Q4 around one of our laundry brands. And so that part brings it back down because coupons are not in Nielsen. So that brings it back down as well as some SRAs, sales returns and allowances back down to 4%. So that\u2019s how you get there. It looks like it\u2019s the same, but there\u2019s really two moving pieces.","Matthew Farrell","Britta, you want to take a swing at the Amazon?","Britta Bomhard","Sure. I can talk about investment in Amazon. So, I think with all our marketing investment we actually evaluate efficiency. So, Amazon\u2019s part of the mix, and from that we read rather how effective it is. We don\u2019t do it like specific by any retailer ads. It\u2019s much more about what can we achieve in total results.","Andrea Teixeira","[indiscernible].","Britta Bomhard","Of course, at Amazon, I would say what you will see is that effectiveness in their advertising, if you go on their sites, the search engine has been improving. So, with that, yes, we are investing with Amazon in line with the results we\u2019re getting.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Nik?","Nik Modi","Yes. I have one question with 11 parts. Just on the business, I\u2019m just looking at slide number 25 with some of the businesses, the power brands have been struggling. Matt, maybe you can just give us some context on what the challenges are, so we can kind of think about 2019 and some of the drivers?","Matthew Farrell","Yes, which \u2013 you\u2019re looking at this slide with the 7 out of 11?","Nik Modi","Yes. So vitamins, XTRA, SPINBRUSH, ORAJEL?","Matthew Farrell","Yes, okay. Yes, generally, investors are only interested in things that are red or that can hurt you. So, we would generally say 7 out of 11 is a win, that\u2019s a high five year.","Nik Modi","High five. Got it.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. So, let\u2019s just bound through them. So, vitamins, for example. So the vitamin category you know when we bought the business, it had 6 competitors, now it has 30. So, it\u2019s very cluttered right now. We continue to grow our consumption year-over-year, but we\u2019re just not growing as fast as the category. What\u2019s happened is that a lot of the pill brands are now moving to gummies. Net they\u2019re about standing still, but gummies is growing faster, right, than the pill category. So, consequently, it looks like we\u2019re losing share. But we\u2019ve been happy about our growth. We grew at 6% consumption in 2018. So, we feel good about that. What\u2019s the next one?","Nik Modi","XTRA?","Matthew Farrell","Okay, so XTRA, XTRA has been in decline for a number of years up until this year. So, this year we\u2019re just slightly \u2013 a slight decline in 2018. So, we \u2013 actually that is a good story for us. That one almost turned green. We almost got to 8%. So that\u2019s terrific and one of the reasons that has done better it\u2019s because of our Odor Blasters campaign. We brought Odor Blasters into the XTRA story.","Nik Modi","Okay. And then just on ORAJEL and SPINBRUSH?","Matthew Farrell","Yes. SPINBRUSH has been a tough one for a number of years, again a cluttered category. That\u2019s where we shipped 40% of our units in the fourth quarter. There\u2019s a lot of competition from Colgate, Crest, others. There isn\u2019t a really great story. It\u2019s not that big a business, but we\u2019re still the number one battery-operated toothbrush, but it\u2019s very competitive. What\u2019s your last one?","Nik Modi","And ORAJEL?","Matthew Farrell","ORAJEL. You want to take ORAJEL?","Britta Bomhard","Sure. So first of all, I have to extend more love to XTRA than actually Matt has done. I think if you look at the laundry category in total in the different price segments, XTRA competes in a very value-priced tier. We\u2019ve actually done significantly better than anybody else in that segment. And as I said, we were so close to being flat. It was minus 10 bps in market share in the end of the year. So, I think that\u2019s a tremendous improvement and if you look at total laundry, an absolutely success. So sorry if I think there is a little bit more passion behind XTRA and we love this brand.","Secondly, I would say on ORAJEL. You might have seen it. We had an FDA change of mind regarding benzocaine and teething products and that has had an impact. We are the number one in teething and in young kids, and as we had to withdraw from that segment that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen a decline. But all our other ORAJEL businesses, so we have canker sore, you\u2019ve seen the new strips, and the kids toothpaste are doing very well. So, that\u2019s actually, as you know, sometimes regulation can be surprising.","Matthew Farrell","Nik, I didn\u2019t hear you thank us for providing that scorecard so that you could ask that question. Okay. Anybody else? Here Caroline.","Caroline Levy","Sorry for the repetition, but can we go back to gross margins, because I think going into the fourth quarter, we saw great sales trends, and we were definitely surprised as it sounds as if you were by the margins. My understanding then is more people in the Company are incentivized by cash flows and by gross margin. Is that what affected the pay?","Rick Dierker","Yes, no, what I\u2019m saying is and Matt said, we have a simple incentive comp program, 25% each, but when cash flow maxes out because of great working capital management, the P&L expense for that is split between SG&A and cost of goods sold. And so it\u2019s only 10 basis points or 20 basis points really. I mean, we\u2019re going through to \u2013 maybe 20 basis points on the gross margin impact from higher incentive comp.","Caroline Levy","Okay. And then on the pricing, you took your pricing up, but the retail price hasn\u2019t gone up, but your income statements affected by what you get from the stores? So, can you just explain on that?","Rick Dierker","Right. So we \u2013 but typically in industry if you protect, you price protect for the retailers for a period of time, right, because they have their own pricing policies of, yes, you can do your announcement, but you\u2019re going to protect me for 30 days or 60 days or 90 days, right. And so what we\u2019re saying is there was a price protection program even to our pricing to retailers, but that\u2019s all labs and so in Q1 and going forward, it\u2019s a new retail price.","Caroline Levy","Was there forward buying in the fourth quarter, so the volumes \u2013 ","Rick Dierker","We don\u2019t let \u2013 I mean you limit the amount that can ever happen, it\u2019s an immaterial amount. We limit the amount our retailers can order when you have a pre-buy for pricing.","Caroline Levy","Okay. And then if I might, on the WATERPIK. Is WATERPIK lower than average margin to the Company at the gross level?","Rick Dierker","No, it\u2019s not. Gross margins are on par with the company. Now with tariffs, it\u2019s a few 100 basis points lower than the company margin, right, but normal operating \u2013 normal gross margins are on par with the company.","Caroline Levy","So to the extent \u2013 and this is my last one, but to the extent that household continues to grow faster plus WATERPIK grows faster, that\u2019s just a negative mix shift that \u2013 ","Rick Dierker","Well the household business, WATERPIK rolls up in the personal care business, but when the household business grows faster and if the WATERPIK business grows faster with tariffs, then that\u2019s a negative drag on mix. But we were conservative when we planned 2019 was my earlier comment.","Caroline Levy","Got it. Thank you.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Lauren, you\u2019re next.","Lauren Lieberman","Thank you. So first, I just wanted to continue on WATERPIK. I was curious if it\u2019s possible to shift sourcing for WATERPIK to outside of China, so you can just get around the whole tariff issue to begin with? And on top of that, I just want to be clear because I think last quarter when you talked about pricing plans on WATERPIK, I just would have expected it to hurt so much this quarter because the plans were in place and it was discussed. So, is it that your retail partners or your distributors kind of was a longer period of price protection, there was maybe some buying ahead of that pricing going into place that really kind of threw the balance off, because it feels like a lot of the gross margin shortfall in the quarter was related to the dynamic of tariffs and also WATERPIK?","Rick Dierker","Yes, let me answer the second one first. And really Steve Cugine\u2019s Group is doing a great job with WATERPIK, right. They had explosive growth internationally. We\u2019re not changing the price of WATERPIK internationally. But when you have explosive growth internationally and sales are higher than you expected, then all of a sudden, the tariffs which you thought were going to be in inventory are now flowing to the P&L. That\u2019s what happened.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay.","Matthew Farrell","And your other question is with respect to sourcing, so, I\u2019ll let Rick take a swing at that. The short story is, this is a fairly sophisticated product. So, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s easily moved nor do we have plans to move it. So right now, we\u2019re planning on riding things out, but maybe see Rick can give you a little more color on what\u2019s involved at the plan?","Rick Dierker","Yes. So we have a great network of contract manufacturers making the WATERPIK products and we\u2019ve been working with them for a number of years. We are exploring other alternatives outside of China, but as Matt said, it\u2019s a complicated product and we don\u2019t want to jump the gun on that given that the tariff situation is pretty dynamic right now, but we\u2019re doing our homework, so that if they\u2019re here to stay, we will have some options hopefully.","Lauren Lieberman","And then I just had one more on gross margins. The long-term algorithm, everyone else had like seven questions. So, the long-term algorithm though for gross margin, I just want to talk about kind of some of the contributors because in terms of what\u2019s growing fastest in your portfolio, International, SPD, right, temporary hopefully the tariff situation, retail environment arguably only getting tougher and tougher in the U.S., all these components. Like why is 25 basis points kind of the right algorithm going forward? And also in terms of the closer in promotional environment, you definitely cited the continued more rational environment in laundry as being contributing to your outlook for \u201819. But at the same time, we know you\u2019ve got Henkel with very, very clear objectives. I know you talked about nothing\u2019s changed. These guys never step back. But the numbers are big what they\u2019re throwing around. And again, if we\u2019re talking about promotion being lower and a positive contributor in the near-term, why isn\u2019t that something we should be worried about changing course as we go through \u201819?","Matthew Farrell","Look, whenever you build a plan, you build some flexibility, so you have some bullets to fire if something different happens. So, of course, if there\u2019s something unforeseen that happens, we\u2019ll react to that. But I don\u2019t have anything to add to what I said earlier about what our expectations are. We actually think we can pull back further on promotions in laundry in 2019.","Rick Dierker","And the other thing that\u2019s kind of under the radar, but we put a slide up about it was how much progress we\u2019re making with our productivity program. It was plus 80 basis points in 2018, plus 100 basis points is the outlook in 2019. We\u2019re in the early days of reinvigorating our productivity program with incremental dedicated resources in R&D and supply chain. So, we\u2019re doing things that give us the flexibility, the degrees of freedom so we can confidently say 25 basis points is the evergreen model.","Matthew Farrell","So while we have a robust continuous improvement program, it\u2019s just that in \u201817 and \u201818, all the cost increases from \u2013 \u201818 I should say, outran whatever we could do with continuous improvement. And there was another step up this year with costs, but not as much. It was 250 basis points in \u201818, I\u2019d say 190 basis points negative in \u201819. But as Rick said, we\u2019ve got a lot more juice in continuous improvement, but not enough to overcome that next year. So, pricing is what gets us over the hurdle. But we still see plenty of runway in future to become far more efficient as a company.","Rick Dierker","Okay. Alright, last one.","Lauren Lieberman","I just had a quick follow-on on the pricing what you just mentioned. If I understand it correctly, you have pricing in the market on about 30% of your portfolio and then you\u2019re considering doing more pricing. Is that a decision you\u2019re going to be making in the next few weeks or months or is that more of a second half decision when we can expect to see more pricing going in the market?","Rick Dierker","Yes. We\u2019ve said \u2013 we\u2019ve said in the release, we\u2019re already talking to retailers about categories beyond the initial 30%. As far as when that would hit, we wouldn\u2019t be able to disclose that. But those conversations are happening right now and particularly in the personal care categories.","Lauren Lieberman","Would it be then more than half of your portfolio in terms of the discussions you\u2019re having right now in terms of price increases?","Matthew Farrell","Yes, we\u2019re not prepared to say. We will update everybody in May. Okay. One more question. Okay. You\u2019re the absolute last. Okay Michael, what have we got?","Michael Steib","Thank you, Matt. It\u2019s a marketing question. It\u2019s about the millennials. Could you share your thoughts about that particular group of the population and specifically what behavior are you observing that are helping you, hurting you, or what are the bigger trends that will affect us over the next 3 years to 5 years?","Britta Bomhard","Well, that\u2019s a very philosophical question. So first of all, question is how many of you have millennials in your household already? So first of all, I would say what do we see. I mean, we\u2019ve all heard about it. Maybe a little bit more sheltered lives early on later moving out and forming their own households, a little bit more, how would I say, media consumption very different. I think we\u2019re showing how we\u2019re responding to that in all our different avenues. Overall, I see nothing, but opportunity for us. I think millennials are great, because it gives you opportunity to have a dialog with consumers going forward. And as I would say, we are very fast, agile at adapting, that works in our favor.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. We\u2019re going to pull the plug right now. Thanks for coming today, gang. We\u2019re very enthusiastic about 2019. We\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in delivering our plan. Thank you all for coming today."],"4981":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

Church & Dwight will be discussing the results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis.","The company believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of their business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating their business.","These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. See the Appendix in this morning's earnings release for a reconciliation.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll provide some color on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is finished, we'll open the call up for questions. So Q1 was a strong quarter for our company. There's lots of good news. Organic sales growth of 2.3%, exceeded our outlook of approximately 1% to 2% and we also exceeded our EPS outlook.","Our global consumer business delivered organic sales growth of 2.6%, led by continued strong growth by our international consumer business. In the U.S., organic sales grew approximately 1%, meeting our expectations and comping a big first quarter in Q1 2016 of 5%, and six of 10 power brands grew share in the quarter. So, a good report card there.","Our international consumer business exceeded our expectations with 11.8% organic growth. International has emerged as a growth driver for us over the past few years. The investments that we have made in new leadership, regional hubs and brand focus, have been paying off. Our international business grew 8% in 2015, 10% in 2016 and we expect 6% to 7% growth in 2017. In Q1, many regions contributed to the success story.","Turning to Specialty Products, our Specialty Products Division saw a continued improvement. The flattish organic growth was actually better than expected. The dairy economy continues to recover from the weakness that we saw in 2016, and we have easier comps going forward.","So, now back to the U.S., categories slowed down a bit in the U.S. in Q1, particularly January and February, but we have seen signs of improvement in March and April. Innovation is always a good stimulant for category growth and we have excellent innovation on the way. Many of our new products are hitting store shelves now and we attempt to get behind them in the coming quarters.","We've leveled the playing field in unit dose laundry detergent with the launch of our own Triple Chamber detergent product. In Q1, before the launch of Triple Chamber, ARM & HAMMER nearly doubled the category growth rate for unit dose for the fourth consecutive quarter. The Triple Chamber product is hitting shelves now and we expect future share gains as a result. And liquid detergent, which still accounts for almost three quarters of the category, ARM & HAMMER detergent grew share for the 29th consecutive quarter. Also, in laundry, we are restaging our OXICLEAN laundry detergent in Q2 with new packaging, a new formula and new advertising.","Turning to cat litter, our launch of ARM & HAMMER SLIDE cat litter is off to a great start. Consumers have responded to this innovative new litter that does not stick to the litter box. This benefit addresses a major frustration for cat odors adding much needed convenience to the clean-up process. SLIDE has already reached a 4-share of the clumping litter segment and we expect to gain share as we move through the year.","In adult gummy vitamins, VITAFUSION is launching an energy vitamin made with caffeine to address consumers' desire for mental energy and alertness. Over to condoms, TROJAN has launched a new XOXO premium quality condom targeting both men and women with a soft touch, aloe lubricated latex in a unique portable carrying case. TROJAN will be advertised for the first time on network television this year. Many of you will see our commercials in series finales this spring. In fact, we will be airing on Saturday Night Live this Saturday night, May 6.","Dry shampoo. Dry shampoo consumption grew 32% in Q1 and is now $120 million category in the U.S. Our BATISTE brand launched new variants to continue to broaden the line. Our new lightly scented Bare is getting strong reviews from women and BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo in the world.","Just a few more things. As you read in the release, we plan to put significant muscle behind these innovations in the next couple of quarters, both in store and on-the-air. Remember that six out of our 10 power brands grew share in Q1, and we're aiming to improve on that mark in the coming quarters.","On the acquisition front, we continue to build the capabilities of our animal productivity business. This week, we closed the acquisition of Agro BioSciences. This is a terrific business that adds products and a lot of scientific talent to our team, and we are really excited about the Wisconsin team, that's joining us. Agro BioSciences expands our ability to provide non-antibiotic solutions to promote the health and productivity of production animals. And this is in a world that will grow population from 7 billion today to 9 billion by the middle of the century. And we expect this business to grow very rapidly in the coming years.","Finally, we streamlined the company a bit in Q1 with the sale of our Brazilian chemical business. We will continue to concentrate on growing our existing consumer business in Brazil. Next up is Rick to give you details of our first quarter results and Q2 and full-year outlook.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I will start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.52 per share compared to $0.43 in 2016, up 20.9%. The $0.52 was better than our $0.46 outlook, largely due to organic revenue and gross margin expansion as well as $0.03 from tax.","Adjusted EPS excludes a $0.01 per share charge related to the sale of the Brazilian Specialty Products business and includes a $0.03 per share positive impact from adopting a new stock option accounting standard. We did change our methodology here, which is consistent with the rest of our peer group.","Reported revenues were up 3.3% to $877 million. Organic sales grew 2.3%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 1% to 2%. The organic sales beat was driven by our international consumer business.","Now, let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales increased by 0.8%, primarily due to ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, BATISTE dry shampoo, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter. We continue to expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2.5% for the Consumer Domestic business.","International organic growth was up an impressive 11.8%, driven largely by OXICLEAN, FEMFRESH and BATISTE in the export business and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and litter in Canada. As Matt said, investments we've made continue to drive that business forward.","For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales were essentially flat due to lower volumes in the specialty chemical sector of the business. The animal productivity business improved in both price and volume on higher demand from the U.S. dairy industry, as milk prices and dairy farm profitability improved.","Turning now to gross margin. Our adjusted first quarter gross margin was 45.7%, a 110 basis point increase from year ago. Q1 benefited from two factors primarily, productivity programs and the higher margin from acquired businesses. These were partially offset by higher raw material cost and a slight drag from price mix.","Moving now to marketing. Marketing as a percent of revenue was 10.3%, which was down slightly year-over-year, but remember, we are shifting some spend out of Q1 and Q4 into Q2 and Q3. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.6%, flat from the prior year.","And now to operating profit. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 22.8%, which was 170 basis points higher than the prior year. Other income and expense was $5.9 million, which was a drag and largely due to $8 million of expense from interest.","Next, the income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 30.3% on an adjusted basis. And now to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. We generated $139.6 million of net cash for the quarter, $30 million decrease from the same quarter a year ago, largely due to working capital and some retiree deferred comp and higher incentive comp payout.","So, in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 2.3% organic, 20.9% EPS growth which translates into a reported EPS growth of 18.6%.","Now, turning to second quarter outlook. We expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%. Consumer domestic growth looks similar to Q1, and international SPD growth (10:01) to 1% to 2% of the company. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be significantly higher year over year and gross margin to contract in Q2, as we increase support behind our new products.","We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.37 compared to $0.43 a year ago, or a 14% decrease year over year. Primary drivers, again, are the higher marketing in support of our new products and the higher consumer promotional spend.","And now turning to the full year. To summarize our thinking, we're maintaining our expectations for organic sales of 3%. In February, we called approximately 60 basis points of gross margin expansion and given the incremental promotion, we're now calling 40 basis points. Our full-year marketing expectation is approximately 12% of sales, consistent with 2016 and prior years.","Moving to SG&A. Our original expectations were a 10 basis point increase. We now expect that to be about 20 basis points, largely due to the incremental amortization from our small deals. We expect operating margin expansion to be flat when adjusted for the pension and Brazilian charges. And then finally for the income tax line, the full-year rate forecast will be 33.5%, which includes the effect of the new stock option accounting standard in our outlook.","On a reported basis, we now expect EPS to be $1.75 to $1.77 per share, which includes a $0.01 negative impact from the Brazil charge and a $0.14 to $0.16 negative impact from the pension settlement. Excluding these items, we now expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth of $1.92 per share.","And finally, turning to free cash flow. We continue to expect $600 million, net of approximately $50 million of CapEx for the full year of 2017. This represents an industry-leading 124% free cash flow conversion.","And with that, we'll turn it back over to you, Sumat, and I can answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question goes to the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Your line is open.","Megan Cody - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. This is actually Megan Cody on for Steve Powers. I was wondering, could you guys break down your international growth trend a little bit further and talk about the sustainability of those rates?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So we posted 11% organic growth in Q1, and more than half \u2013 let's say two-thirds of that is non-export. Too often we focus on the export part of the business. But, let's say a third of it is export and two-thirds of it is the rest of the world. You know we're making a lot of investments there over the past couple years, so we think the export growth will continue for us. If your question is around the full year, so we're calling 6% to 7% for the full year \u2013 or we posted almost the 12% for Q1.","So we don't expect that the 12% to continue throughout the year. To break it down, we mentioned in the release that Canada had a big quarter, but it does vary from quarter to quarter, somewhat lumpy as to which businesses or which regions might drive it. I think the best way to think about it is that we do think that we're taking our number up on the full year. I think we started the year with 4% to 5% for international to grow and now we're calling 6% to 7%.","Megan Cody - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Operator","If your line's on mute, please unmute your phone.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hello, Bill?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","It's okay, just move on to the next call.","Operator","All right. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Matt, curious to kind of get some thoughts from you on how you're seeing the U.S. environment. You sounded pretty good, I guess, on sort of what you're seeing in March and April, and we're seeing that in Nielsen data as well. But of course, a lot of the sort of cautionary commentary that we're hearing, I'm sure is not lost on you guys at all. So a couple of questions with that, just kind of how you're seeing, Matt, things with the retail environment and the state of the consumer.","And then, the second part of the question with respect to your outlook for the year and what seems to be baked in, using sort of back-of-the-napkin math, because you guys broke out that 110 basis point contribution from non-tracked channels. It would seem like the tracked channel growth in the quarter in terms of your shipments matched pretty well I think with what we're seeing in the Nielsen data. And probably to get to the 3% core sales or organic sales for the year, you're baking in some of this improvement that we're seeing. So I just wanted to know if that was sort of accurate math roughly and sort of fair characterization of your outlook.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Okay. So I'll give you some color around the macros, and I'll let Rick address the reconciliation from the, say, measured channels and what we post for organic versus what you've seen.","So as far as macros go, yeah, so the categories certainly January, February are somewhat slow, picked up March and April. We started the year thinking that our full year was based on a 2% category growth rate. We didn't see that in Q1 as we're little closer to 1.5% for the categories that we play in. We still feel good that we can get there, and we saw GDP just everybody else, 70 basis points, so that's a bit of a head scratch. We got to wait for the jobs report on Friday.","But as far as the trends go, there's a lot of discounting that took place in the first quarter. We saw laundry was down 50 basis points, but remember, year-over-year, laundry was up 6% last year as a category. So, it's like a huge comp for laundry, but there is well a lot of discounting in the first quarter. You heard a couple of retailers cite the impact of late tax returns of anybody who claims here in income credit, you can't get your refund until after Feb 15.","Then, of course, there's uncertainty always affects consumer behavior. So, you have \u2013 because we have a new administration, there's uncertainty around health care and taxes. And then somebody wrote a piece on Hispanic purchasing bloc and that's down year-over-year. So, it's empirical data that supports that, why, because of worries about immigration policy and deportation.","And then, you have the shift to online, and obviously, that's \u2013 you won't see that in measured channels. But, yeah, certainly, there was a slowdown for the first couple of months. I see March and April picking up. I don't think other than what I cited, I don't think there's a lot more that we would point to as far as to why it's slowed down, but things certainly look better in April. So, we're not expecting a repeat of that for the remainder of the year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Then, in terms of shipping to consumption. For Q1, our math says for the quarter that we're maybe down 70 basis points or organic growth was 0.8% for example and domestically, that's 150 basis points, and we said about 110 basis points of that 150 basis points was largely due to untracked channels. We think that trend will continue. I think you're going to see that across our space. For us, from an organic perspective for the full year, we had 2.3% in Q1, we're calling 1% to 2% in Q2 and then Q3 and Q4, that would require high-3s type of numbers.","We feel good about that for a variety of reasons but also because of even the category growth comps year-over-year. Remember, laundry grew about 4.5% year ago, 4.5% in the first half and about 2% in the second half. So, we have some good tailwinds on that perspective too.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Just one follow-up, guys, if I may. Matt, any update, any commentary you can share on the M&A pipeline, any particular areas you're seeing, valuations et cetera, that would be helpful.","And then with respect to the small tuck-in deal, the Agro BioSciences sort of additive in the specialty business. So broadly with that, Matt, so specialty is like less than 10% of mix. What role do you kind of see with specialty? Do you have any sort of percentage in mind or is there an aversion to how high you would take specialty as a percent of the company's mix within sort of the broader household products and personal care portfolio? Would you ever take \u2013 should the asset present itself, would you take the business up to 15% to 20% of mix? Just curious as to how you see that. Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I would say that the Specialty Products business and particularly animal productivity business is a business that we'd like to get as big as it can get. And the reason for that is that, it's completely on trend, A. B, we have a base in technology and science behind it. From a financial standpoint, its operating margins are close to the consumer business and its asset-light. So, it meets all of our criteria frankly of the business that we would buy. It just happens to be a business that we've had for many, many years. And now because of the trend towards non-antibiotics to raise production animals, we find ourselves in the sweet spot.","So, we bought a business in January 2015 called VI-COR and that was a prebiotic business. And we just picked up this fantastic business in Wisconsin, Agro BioSciences. And these guys can customize probiotics for their customers, I mean it's just a wonderful business model. So, we think the combination of those two businesses with our existing business is going to make us less cyclical, A, and, B, able to serve more than the dairy market going forward. So, we feel real good about that business.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Meanwhile, Kevin, I mean, you should see in the release, right, we did sell the chemical business down in Brazil, so it's investing where the future is.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks. First question is just kind of talking about the key categories, you're directing your promotional dollars to in Q2. And then also, perhaps, you can give a little bit of color on what your expectations are on volume versus price mix and specifically for Q2 given the step-up in promotional spend?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. A lot of this with respect to promotional spend, we wouldn't be very specific about where that's going. We do have to narrow some gaps a bit in laundry. So, laundry, we actually were down year-over-year in our spend for ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN as the percentage sold on deal. So, that gap has widened a bit with some of our competitors. So, that would be one area we would put some money to work. So, we'll selectively use some promotions and couponing in Q2 and Q3, just to narrow those gaps.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And then from a volume, price mix in Q2, we think volume is going to be up about 3% to 4% and price mix will be a drag of 1% to 2%. And that's also why margin came down for the full year from 60% to 40%. So, that's the short answer.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And then, back to the M&A and Specialty. Could you talk about the growth rate of that business to kind of warrant a 7 times multiple, I mean excuse my ignorance, but is that just the going rate for livestock probiotics at this point?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. We don't always look at the trailing EBITDA or sales multiple, Olivia. But I would tell you that on a forward EBITDA multiple, we're 10 times or less. And that business is going to grow really fast and that's our expectation.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And then a combination of that business with our organization is, we're going to work real hard to make sure they hit that earn-out target.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly on OXICLEAN, the restage that you're planning, it sounds like your doubling down again. And obviously, laundry has been a very tough category the last couple of years, whether it'd be for sales and products et cetera, et cetera. So, can you talk a little bit about the plans and what's changing for OXICLEAN this time around?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, you're going to be \u2013 you'll see it on shelf soon. So, we have a new bottle, and we've got new claims which \u2013 they aren't public either right now and a new advertising. So yeah, you say we've launched it a couple years ago, 2014 and we've kind of gone sideways for a couple of years around a 1-share. And of course, Persil came in I guess 2015 and so that was unexpected. So now, we've kind of retrenching and restaging the business and we feel good about our prospects.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Just on the industry trends, saying that the things are looking better in April. I mean, we've heard that from a few others. Any reason why you think that is and do you think that \u2013 or why you think that will continue?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I wouldn't say we \u2013 it's better in comparison to January and February. I think we're still thinking the categories will be between 1.5% and 2% for the year. So, we've kind of looked it as a blip sort of recovery. We're not euphoric. We're not saying that, hey, it's blue skies and cool breezes in the rest of the year, but it's better than it was, Bill. So, I think, we're kind of back to where we thought we were in February when we gave our full year outlook.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And on Olivia's question on the restage of OXI and maybe just what you're seeing out of Henkel in general? If you're seeing any change from the Sun, Henkel, if you're expecting anything? But also, with the thought that maybe OXI's initial prospects were deemed by the strong launch of Persil. Are you rethinking on pricing or where it should be positioned as you restage that whole product?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, we haven't changed the position. I mean, it is just a slightly under a Tide Persil again from a price standpoint. As far as what we see out of the Sun-Henkel combination. All you can really look at is tactics and how much was sold on deal in Q1 this year versus last year. I can comment with respect to Purex. Purex brand was pretty much the same last year versus this year. There was a significant increase in Sun sold on deal, like 41% versus 35% last year in Q1. So, you might say they got a little more promotional on the lower end. But on the top end, Persil is still doing well. We continue to take some share. So we have to find our niche below Tide and Persil, and we think we've found a way to do that.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And last one for me. Is there an expectation of where SLIDE can get in terms of share? I mean, are you thinking high single-digits by the end of the year?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","We're not going to do any grandstanding right now. We just feel real good about the launch. It's only been out there for a few weeks now. So we'll update you again in August, but we like the way consumers are reacting to it. It's a good insight.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Sounds great. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, Bill.","Operator","Our next question is from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. Thank you, good morning. So, I just wanted to ask first about the laundry category, just following up on Bill's question. So it seems like you're gaining a lot of share in laundry, especially if we look at the four-week data. So is that just the new products, or do you think you've gained more shelf space relative to Henkel and P&G? And then just if you could talk about trends outside the scanned channels in laundry for your business.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, well, laundry outside the scanned channels, I wouldn't say is much of a story for us right now. It's more on shelf. People still do buy \u2013 that's a category that's less developed from online versus bricks and mortar. Yeah, as far as how we're doing. I mentioned that ARM & HAMMER liquid grew share again in the first quarter for the 29th consecutive quarter. ARM & HAMMER grew 30 bps in the first quarter.","Where our issue is, is on Oxi and XTRA, so that's what we run into. On the XTRA side, we lost 30 bps when we do the discounting. So that's one of the reasons why we're going to have to close some of those gaps in the next couple of quarters. We get our fair share of distribution gains just like other folks. We have strong brands, particularly ARM & HAMMER, so some of it is distribution, but the success of ARM & HAMMER in the first quarter was not promotionally driven. As I mentioned earlier that we actually sold less on deal in Q1 2017 than 2016. And now, we got the new triple-chamber launching, so we feel great about that, right? So ARM & HAMMER grew share in Q1 without it. And now, we're finally showing up with that. And our unit dose share, if you combine Oxi and ARM & HAMMER, it's over a 4-share. So, we got to get our fair share back in unit dose. That's the future, so that's where we're putting our money.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just on this new acquisition, the probiotics. What is the \u2013 I know you said the forward EBITDA multiple was around 10 times. Should we think of it as a next year forward multiple, or is it more sort of out of the future? Just if we could think about the timing and just sort of how big the opportunity could be next year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Next year. Next year forward multiple around 10 times. That's a good way to think about it.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for -","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Congrats on a pretty solid result in a tough environment out there.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Clearly, International was a strong source of strength for you guys with that 12% growth. A couple questions on that. Can you give us a little more context and color about exactly what it is and where that growth is coming from? And then related, your guidance of 6% to 7% implies sort of a decel to 4% to 5% \u2013 5%. Is that just sort of prudent conservatism, or is there real reason to think that the business could sort of come back down to earth?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, look, first off, you've heard us say on other calls in the past that export can be a little bit lumpy. So that's a bit of it. As far as where the success is coming from, you've heard us say we got new leadership, we got new regional hub that's certainly helping the export business, but we have a focus on brands. So, the important brands for us in the International is STERIMAR which is a nasal hygiene, FEMFRESH which is feminine hygiene and BATISTE of course which is dry shampoo. And then we've had success with ARM & HAMMER in Canada and Mexico.","So, there's a lot of effort around those brands and that concentrated effort has been paying dividends for us. As far as the rest of \u2013 are we sad because the rest of the year isn't 11% and for the next three quarters, no. We've taken Europe from 4% to 5% to 6% to 7%, and we think that's a prudent way to think about the year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, I agree. There's nothing too disappointing on that 4% to 5%, if that is with the rest of the year. Turning to \u2013 well, as you offset 6% to 7%, you're not upping your overall sales, so kind of what's moving a little bit lower in that algorithm?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. Yes. So, we said 2.5% to 3% for domestic beginning of the year. So, we're shaving that back down to 2.5%.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, largely because of the incremental trading and promotional activity. I think volumes are still as strong as they were, in our opinion.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Makes sense. One more question and I'll pass it on. The 110 bps of outperformance, pretty big fade from 300 bps, kind of back to normal long term. I think we've always had roughly 100. What drove the fade and is there any sort of lumpiness we should think about on that as we think through the rest of the year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. So you really asked about gross margin, why is it going down so much and...","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, no, no. The sales outdelivery. Sorry, consumer domestic, the 110 basis points of overdelivery versus measured channels. That was closer to 300 when you finished the last year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Got you. Yeah. I think part of that, when we're talking last year especially, we had some of the club channel helping that number. This is purely largely online untracked channels because we're confident in any of the club benefits.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, first question. I wanted to go back to marketing and promo and obviously, you guys mentioned this morning that you're kind of increasing spend in the second and third quarter out of the fourth quarter. Is that due to the timing of your innovation or it's just right now, you're seeing a really competitive environment given where some of your competitors are spending?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. On the marketing side, Joe, I would just tell you that kind of consistent with what we said in February, over the last few years, we had just seen an increase really in Q4, on top of Q4 increases. So, we want to move some of that money back to where it belongs in support of the new products and that's what we're doing by moving it to Q2 and Q3.","On a trade and couponing perspective, I'd say it's really across the board in Q2 and Q3, and so hopefully, that helps.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Is there a risk that fourth quarter doesn't come down to that, so it remains at a high level?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","There's some in Q4 too. But we're pretty laid back about it. I think as we said before, we expect category growth to be 1.5% and 2%. And we've done the marketing shift, we've put the coupon in and trade in place. And so, that's what we're confident about a 3% call for the year.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then secondly, on litter, like you mentioned the new SLIDE product is off to a good start. Clorox mentioned yesterday, they gained some share, Tidy Cats has done very well. So, curious what the overall ARM & HAMMER business is doing in terms of market share. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. You're right. We lost some share in the first quarter, but the latest four weeks, now we're up and we're up with the categories. So, we think the SLIDE is going to start pulling the train for us the rest of the way.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, Joe.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, I was hoping if you can pretty much understand how TROJAN was weaker this quarter and how \u2013 I know you were staging a new contain as you pointed out in the \u2013 so were you just like reducing the advertisement spend so that you can stage it for the second quarter?","And also if you can touch on how you're spending. I'm assuming in these categories are under the radar like dry shampoo and probiotics, that you're gaining market share and also gaining distribution. So, if you can touch on that. Then lastly if you can contemplate bolt-ons internationally, given that you have been so lucky with \u2013 not lucky I should say, so efficient on the growth in Mexico and Canada, so, potentially being a white space for you guys. Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Normally, you only get one or two, you got three.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes, so I'll take the TROJAN one really quick. So, your question was why is TROJAN down. Well, in context with my earlier answer on marketing spend, we did \u2013 marketing spend was down for TROJAN in Q1 because we wanted to move it into Q2 and Q3 in support of our new products. So, we hope to see that trend reverse as we increase our marketing spend and our new XOXO condom launches.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And also, with TROJAN, that's a more developed category with respect to online. So, when you look at the measured channels, there is always a shift going to online purchases. And your second question was on International?","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. About M&A, if you would contemplate bolt-ons abroad.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And so, will we contemplate, say that again?","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","M&A abroad. So, let's say bolt-on acquisitions that you could find in countries like Mexico or Canada or other countries or even the U.K.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Sure. 2011 is when we acquired the BATISTE business and more recently, we just bought a business from J&J, which is a hemorrhoid business that's in multiple countries, primarily U.K., South Africa, Australia, Canada, so, certain English-speaking countries. So, yeah, we did one recently, and we do want to build out our International business. So, we are on the hunt for acquisitions outside the U.S. And we apply the same criteria to those as we do for domestic acquisitions. So, yes. And your last question was the advent \u2013 are probiotics becoming more important to vitamin?","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. No, I was just hoping if you can touch on how you, obviously you are advancing on market share on those categories. But how much of your growth probably is coming from, for example, your organic growth that you had in the first quarter is coming from these new businesses, if you will, or new distribution?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. We don't get into that brand-level detail on organic growth. I would just say even for next year in 2018, you're going to see some of those small acquisitions play a good role in organic growth. But for now, it's all \u2013 we'd be calling that out separately for reported growth anyway. Not really lot to add there.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Anderson with William Blair. Your line is open.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, Matt. Hi, Rick.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Two quick ones for me. Wonder if you could talk broadly about e-commerce and which particular categories or brands are bigger for you in the e-commerce channel? And do you think you have your kind of fair share in e-commerce relative to kind of conventional and kind of what you're doing there to make sure that is the case? And then the second question is just an update on BATISTE both in the U.K. and the U.S. and if that's continuing to see the kind of growth that you're looking for within that brand. Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Okay. As far as online goes, you may have heard us say, or maybe others, that in general, consumer products companies have 1% to 3% of their global sales online. And not too long ago, we were at 1% and then we moved to 2%. So today, we're at 3%, that's our run rate. And in the U.S., it's 4% of our net sales. So that continues to build for us, so consequently then we have to become a lot more sophisticated in facing that market. And it's \u2013 certainly it's Amazon, it's Walmart.com, Target.com, it's all the big direct companies. So we have to interface with all of these folks for this new online class of trade. But I would say it's building, it's more developed in the U.S. than outside the U.S. As I said, it's 4% in the U.S., it's less internationally, but it's going to continue to build. What was your second question?","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","A question on BATISTE.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Oh, yeah, BATISTE. BATISTE has been a rocket ship for us. One of the things we've pointed out is that the U.K. market in dollars is a $60 million market, and it's a country with 60 million people. And the growth of the dry shampoo market in the U.S. has just been astonishing. It grows 20% to 30% a quarter year over year. It's now $120 million, and of course we have over 300 million people in the U.S. So you would think that this category has got a lot of runway ahead of it, and is going to generate a lot of growth for the company in the future. So hope that helps you.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.","Shirley Serrao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Shirley Serrao for Lauren Lieberman. Just wanted to talk a little bit about non-tracked channels. They're clearly emerging as a significant contributor to top line. Could you talk about what kind of investments you're making here? Is it primarily online and club, or are you exploring new channels beyond this? Is there room to innovate or push further? Just some more color would be great. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. The non-tracked channels would be club, but it would also be online, would also be beauty. So you've got three channels there to think about when you're trying to reconcile between non-measured and reported numbers. And I would say we treat all the channels similarly. I mean, obviously, there's some sophistication in digital marketing, which digital marketing also is going to (41:31) all your bricks-and-mortar marketing. So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular we're doing differently, treating those particular retailers than other retailers. Hope that helps you.","Shirley Serrao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi, how you doing? This is Armani Khoddami in for Jon Feeney. So maybe -","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Yeah, how are you? So maybe a quick follow-up there on the non-tracked benefit. It sounds like, Rick, you said that you guys are comping some wins in club or Costco last year? Could you elaborate maybe what those are that are now sort of in the base? And then with the majority of the non-tracked benefit now coming, e-commerce and beauty, like you were just saying, I mean, this seems to be \u2013 a lot of it is BATISTE. Could you talk about the opportunity on BATISTE still a lot of distribution wins, or do you feel like now that you're in ULTA and in some of the other mass outlets, is it mostly just the penetration? Thank you very much.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, sure, I'll take the first one. So, just to reemphasize what I told Jason, he was asking there was a 300 basis point difference between our kind of our tracked and untracked organic growth from a year ago. And that was really driven because we had some club wins and we had some high \u2013 some growth online. We've anniversaried that growth, and in Q1, it's largely solely online growth, which is still significant. I mean, we have businesses like vitamins, for example, or like condoms that you heard Matt allude to that are doubling year over year. Right? So, we just have some really strong growth online.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. As far as BATISTE goes, yes, we continue to get distribution. We are the number one brand, and our share continues to expand as the category grows. So we're getting new distribution, but we're getting, what's really driving it is velocity. There's just so much demand for the product and being a number one brand, we're winning. And we actually have the best product out there as far as efficacy goes, so it's just a combination of both great marketing, good claims and the best product.","Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next questions is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning, guys. Wanted to ask first just a housekeeping. The shelf space for the three-chamber pod, is that coming from existing or are you guys getting a bit of incremental shelf placement for that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Yeah we're getting some incremental space with the pod upgrade.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Remember retails are putting a lot more focus on pods over time, so that shelf space is growing.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then, second just on thoughts about creating even more specialized packaging for key product categories that you could sell, whether being sold online in an increasing way. Do you think there's a need to do it? Do you think it creates a bit of a competitive advantage in doing so, especially as I sort of think about perhaps some of your competitors being a bit slower moving in decisions like that. I think there's a necessity, opportunity, just any sort of thoughts there would be helpful.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, I think that's true. The online packaging is and will be different for a lot of categories going forward.","So, that's one thing we're looking at across all of our categories. And that's a big change. But as our company, we always \u2013 as you correctly point out, is we move quickly and focus in speed is, those are the two hallmarks of Church & Dwight, and we look at change as our friend. So, we like our chances to the extent that people are going to move quickly to different packaging where appropriate and be first.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great.

In our last earnings call in May, we told you that we exited 2011 with strong momentum towards achieving our annual organic revenue growth target of 3% to 4%. We expected the organic revenue growth for the first half of 2012 to be higher than the second half due to the higher organic revenue growth levels in the back half of 2011.","That is exactly what has happened, as we have delivered 8.4% organic revenue growth in the first quarter of 2012, followed by 3.7% growth in the second quarter, for a net of 6% organic revenue growth in the first half of 2012. That puts us in great shape to deliver our annual organic revenue growth target of 3% to 4%.","We also told you in May that we expected a lower gross margin in the first half of 2012, followed by higher gross margin in the second half, to deliver our annual gross margin target improvement of 25 to 50 basis points.","Despite our gross margin being 110 basis points lower a year ago in the first quarter, and 100 basis points lower a year ago in the second quarter, we are right on track to achieve our annual target, although it will be at the lower end of the range forecasted in our May earnings call.  Matt will tell you in a minute the initiatives that we have already implemented, which will drive higher gross margins in the second half of this year.","The second quarter results also reflect that we continue to tighten our belts on overhead costs, as SG&A as a percent of sales improved by 80 basis points versus year ago. As forecasted in May, we achieved our marketing -- we increased our marketing spend in the second quarter by 200 basis points versus the first quarter to support the launch of new products in our 8 power brands.","This increased marketing spending is paying off, as we achieved market share gains in the majority of our power brands in the second quarter.","Most importantly, we delivered a 6% increase in EPS versus year ago, excluding a $0.04 onetime tax benefit in the year-ago numbers.","This EPS result is ahead of our expectations for the quarter and puts us in line to deliver our annual adjusted EPS target of 9% to 10%. Those of you who know me know that I've been a long-term pessimist about the business environment. I believe we'll continue to face strong headwinds in 2012, including higher commodity costs and weak consumer spending. All consumer packaged goods companies are fighting the same headwinds. But we believe that no other consumer packaged goods company is as well suited us Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. I'll explain my rationale for that statement in a few minutes after Matt provides you with greater insight on the financial results for the second quarter. Go ahead, Matt.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everybody.","I'll start with EPS.  Second quarter EPS was $0.56 per share compared with $0.57 in 2011. EPS was up approximately 6% from year ago compared to an adjusted $0.53 of earnings per share, which excludes the second quarter 2011 tax benefit as a result of New Jersey corporate tax reform.","Reported revenues were up 3.2% to $696 million. Organic sales growth, 3.7%, which excludes the impact of a 2011 brand acquisition and foreign exchange rate changes, which together had a net negative impact of 50 basis points. Of the 3.7% organic growth, approximately 6.3% is due to volume, with 2.6% negative product mix and pricing.","Given our strong first half of 6% organic sales growth, we continue to expect to deliver organic sales at the high end of our 3% to 4% annual target for the year.","Now, let's read this segments.  I want to start with the domestic business. Consumer domestic business' organic sales increased by 5%, primarily due to the higher sales of ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent, period.","Other products that contributed to volume growth were XTRA Liquid Laundry Detergent, ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter, Kaboom cleaners and the introduction of ARM & HAMMER CRYSTAL BURST unit dose laundry detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER Spinbrush, Answer diagnostic kits and ORAJEL oral analgesic products.","Volume contributed approximately 8.6% to sales, partially offset by the 3.6% negative effect of product mix and price, but mostly this was product mix.","I'll now turn to international. Our international organic sales decreased by 2.7% in Q2, due to lower sales in Europe. This decrease is driven by a volume decline of 2.4% and -- with 30 basis points from product mix and price. The decline is concentrated in the U.K. and France. It is largely in our toothpaste and depilatory businesses and caused by competitor actions. We don't expect a repeat in Q3, and the international business is off to good start in July.","With respect to our Specialty Products Division, organic sales were higher by 6.3% with volume up 5.6% and price up 70 basis points. The price is driven by animal nutrition, where we are recovering raw material costs, and the organic increase is primarily due to stronger end markets.","Now back to the total company. Looking ahead for the balance of the year, to remind everybody, we still expect to be at the high end of our 3% to 4% organic growth target. Organic sales growth was higher in the first half of 2012 as a result of easier comps in the first half. The comparisons are far more difficult in the second half due to 5% and 7% growth rates in the third and fourth quarter of 2011, respectively.","We continue to expect our value products, particularly in the laundry category, to continue to benefit from the weak economy and deliver strong organic growth.","Next up is gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 43.5%, a 100 basis points contraction from year ago. The decrease in gross margin is consistent with our expectations and is primarily due to unfavorable product mix, as well as sales of lower-margin consumer domestic household products, which rose 10.5%, and net sales of higher-margin consumer domestic personal care products, which were 5.1% lower.","The contributors to Q2 contraction include the startup of the new California plant, which is now fully operational, and in-house production of unit dose laundry.","Because of the trend in product mix, we continue to expect full year gross margin expansion to be at the lower end of our 25- to 50-basis-point range for 2012. Despite gross margin contraction in the first half, we expect to hit the lower end of the annual 25- to 50-basis-point target as a result of the following:","Number one, productivity improvements from our new plant in California and in-house production of the unit dose laundry products; number two would be the launch of new products in the second half; number three would be lower slotting in the second half versus the first; number four would be recent pricing, which went into effect last week, on ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter; and finally, the benefits of our commodity hedging program. So we are confident in our expectation of second half gross margin expansion because these initiatives have already been implemented.","Now, marketing. Marketing spend for the first quarter was $88 million or 12.7% of revenues. This is a 30-basis-point decline from the prior year spend, but slightly higher on dollar spend.","We grew dollar share on 5 of our 8 power brands in the second quarter. This to due to great execution by our sales and marketing teams. Looking ahead, we expect to increase spending for the balance of the year.","SG&A is next. SG&A was lower year-over-year by $2.5 million. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.2%, which is down 80 basis points from the year ago, and the lower SG&A costs in the quarter primarily reflect lower legal costs.","For the full year, we expect to maintain approximately 13.1% of sales for SG&A, which is down 30 basis points from year ago. This is a reflection of our continuous vigilance to control SG&A.","With respect to operating margin, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 17.6%. Our operating margin was 10 basis points higher than last year's 17.5%.","Income from affiliates decreased slightly due to lower income from our Armand Products joint venture. On a full year basis, we expect a decrease of $3 million on JV income, in part due to the start up of our Natronx joint venture.","Other income was virtually unchanged in the quarter. We do not anticipate any material changes for the full year as compared to 2011.","Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 35.6%, compared to last year's 30.6%, which included a onetime benefit, which I spoke about earlier. We continue to expect the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.","Now turning to cash. We generated $189 million of net cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2012, which is a $17 million increase over last year. And I think it's important to remember that this is net of a $16 million increase in year-to-date CapEx. We have spent $40 million in year-to-date CapEx, of which $21 million related to our new California manufacturing and distribution facility.","I'm going to wrap up now. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include 3.7% organic sales growth, driven by 6.3% volume growth and we increased share in 5 of our 8 power brands, resulting in 6% adjusted EPS growth. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.58 per share, compared to $0.54 for the prior year. We anticipate a high-quality second half, with gross margin expansion and higher marketing spend in each of the next 2 quarters.","Now remember that we averaged less than 12% marketing spend in the first half of 2012, and we expect to average about 14% in the second half. Now this all results in a balanced year when comparing first half and second half earnings per share. So we are maintaining our annual earnings per share goal of $2.41 to $2.43 for the year, which is an increase of 14% to 15% over last year's reported $2.12, and a 9% to 10% earnings increase, excluding the fourth quarter 2011 deferred tax charge.","Back to you, Jim.","James R. Craigie","Thanks, Matt. I'll finish off our call today by adding a little color to the solid second quarter business results Matt just took you through and my outlook on the rest of the year.","Our second quarter business results are directly linked to the 7 factors that support my earlier statement that we believe that no other consumer packaged goods companies is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough business environment.","First, we have the most unique product portfolio in the CPG industry. It consists of both premium and value brands, which puts us in a position to thrive in any type of economy, as exemplified by our consistently strong double-digit EPS growth over the last 10 years. In particular, our value brands, representing about 40% of our revenue base, have experienced strong growth in this recessionary economy, as consumers are making smart choices by switching to, and staying with, our high-quality but lower-priced brands.","A great example of this is the fact that our value based ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent business, which is our largest business, achieved over 15% dollar sales growth in the second quarter, which is the highest growth of any brand in the liquid detergent category. This is a remarkable result in the liquid laundry detergent category, whose consumption actually declined 2% across all channels in the second quarter on a dollar basis.","Our resulting share growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent was an all-time quarterly record for the brand and far outpaced any other brand. By the way, the much heralded launch of the unit dose form has done nothing so far to help sales in the laundry detergent category, as the total combined category consumption of liquid, powder and unit dose form in dollars across all channels, was 0.3% below year ago in the second quarter.","In fact, of all the major liquid laundry detergent brands that have now launched in unit dose form, ARM & HAMMER was the only brand that grew its consumption of its liquid laundry detergent form in the second quarter. And Church & Dwight was the only company that grew its consumption of laundry detergent in the second quarter.","The second factor which was a key driver of Church & Dwight's success is that we have a proven record of building our power brands. We have over 80 brands, but 8 of these brands are our power brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profits.","From 2008 to 2011, we grew market share on these 8 power brands in almost 80% of the quarters. In both the first and second quarter of this year, we grew market share on 5 of our 8 power brands.","Two key factors drove these excellent share results.  First, we have effectively reinvested some of the increased profits from the strong growth of our value brands to increase marketing support on our 8 power brands by a total of 130 basis points from 2007 to 2011.","While our marketing spending in the first and second quarters of 2012 was approximately equal in dollars spent a year ago, we expect to spend more marketing dollars in the second half of this year than a year ago to support the launch of our new products, which will achieve full retail distribution in the second half.","The other factor driving the growth of our power brands is our robust pipeline of new products. Over the past 4 years, new products delivered over 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We have shipped innovative new products in every category this year to support delivery of our organic growth target of 3% to 4%. We expect these new products to be as successful as the new products we launched over the past 4 years.","A sample of these new products include a new sensitive skin product for our ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent line that is designed to significantly enhance the brand's appeal to the over 50% of consumer households who have sensitive skin issues.","Our sensitive skin detergent has an appealing fragrance, which has a unique advantage versus competitive sensitive skin products which have no fragrance. This new product will help to drive continued strong growth of the ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent business, which has achieved 13 consecutive quarters of growth.","Another great new product launch in 2012 is ARM & HAMMER Ultra Last Cat Litter. Every granule of this new cat litter is covered with baking soda to deliver long-lasting odor control. Ultra Last is off to a great start and follows the highly successful launch of the ARM & HAMMER Double Duty Cat Litter line in 2010. These 2 new products now represent over 50% of the brand's total cat litter sales, and helped drive a 15% in dollar consumption and a 2.0% share gain in the second quarter versus year ago.","As a result, the ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter brand has now achieved 34 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, 13 consecutive quarters of share gains and is now the clear #2 brand in the clumping cat litter business. That's pretty impressive for a category which we entered only 14 years ago.","It also shows a strong consumer appeal to the ARM & HAMMER brand, which now delivers over $1 billion in total sales.","On the personal care side of our business, we have several exciting new products in 2012.  First is our new toothpaste for sensitive teeth, which combines the ARM & HAMMER and ORAJEL power brands to provide maximum pain relief in a low abrasion formula that is gentle on enamel. This new product helped to drive a share gain for the ARM & HAMMER brand in the second quarter and a higher rate of consumption growth in the leading toothpaste brand.","Another new product in the oral care category is Tooth Tunes, which is a line of toothbrushes for young children that uses proprietary technology to play 2 minutes of music from a broad range of artists, such as the Black Eyed Peas, Queen and Selena Gomez. For those of you with young children, I guarantee that if use the Tooth Tunes toothbrush, you'll have to yell at your kids to stop brushing instead of yelling at them to brush.","Tooth Tunes represents our first entry into the $800 million manual toothbrush category. And initial distribution results of this new product, which began shipping in July, are very strong.","We are also pursuing 2 other high-margin white space categories to help drive the company's future growth.  First is the vibrator category, which is over $300 million in size, with no major branded players. We first entered this category in 2005 with our iconic TROJAN brand. And this year, we are launching full-size vibrators into new channels. We are very pleased with the distribution and sales gains in our entire Vibrations line, which we believe has been aided by the popularity of the Fifty Shades of Grey novels.","Second, we have entered the dish-washing additive category, which is over $100 million in size via the OXICLEAN brand. The government's mandated removal of phosphates from dishwashing detergents has created a need for a booster product to deal with the noticeable increase in cloudy film on glasses and dishes.","Our new OXICLEAN dishwashing booster product boosts the cleaning power of dishwashing detergents to once again deliver crystal-clear dishware. This new product has already achieved a 9% share of the dishwashing additive category after only 4 months in distribution.","There are many other new products that we are launching in 2012. But in the interest of time, I'll move on with my review of the factors driving Church & Dwight's continued success and discuss our updated earnings guidance for the year.","Let me quickly run through the 5 other key drivers of our success. Number three is that we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands as evidenced by our defense of OXICLEAN, when a large competitor entered the category in 2009.","In fact, OXICLEAN's second quarter share of 40.9% is 200 basis points above its share at the time when the major competitor launched its attack. So we've not only successfully defended our position against this multibillion-dollar mega brand, but now we are attacking back by improving our #1 share position in this category.","The number four factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our international business. While international business represents only 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high single-digit sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the past 5 years. The strong growth continued in the first quarter of 2012, but did not continue in the second quarter due to some issues largely focused in Western Europe, which Matt mentioned earlier.","I am fully confident that we will reinvigorate growth in our international business in the back half of the year based on the programs we have put in place to deal with these issues.","Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margin through cost optimization programs, supply-chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher-margin new products.","We expanded gross margins by 1,550 basis points in the past 10 years. While we did not improve our gross margins in 2010 and 2011, we were successful in holding 380 of the 430-basis-point gain achieved in 2009 despite major headwinds for higher commodity costs. This result was better than all of our major competitors who incurred larger gross margin declines during that period.","As Matt and I told you earlier, our gross margin declined about 100 basis points in the first and second quarters of 2012, but that was in line with our expectations. We have a broad range of initiatives that have already been fully implemented for the back half of 2012 that should enable us to achieve our gross margin target at the low end of our 25 to 50 basis points improvement we originally forecast over 2012.","Factor number six is our ability to tightly manage our overhead costs. Church & Dwight currently has the highest revenue per employee of any major consumer packaged goods company. Despite this best-in-class position, we were able to lower our SG&A overhead cost by an additional 80 basis points in Q2 versus year ago and a full 60 basis points below year ago for the entire first half of 2012. This significant reduction reflects how aggressively we continue to manage our overhead cost to stay best in class in our industry.","Finally, factor number seven is the strong record in free cash flow conversion. We've almost quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. Over the past 5 years, our free cash flow conversion, as a percent of net income, was up 128%, which was best in class in the CPG industry.","Our free cash flow for the first half of 2012 was 10% ahead of last year despite a significantly higher level of planned capital expenditures in the first half of 2012, largely related to the new plant in California.","We expect capital expenditures to be lower than year ago in the back half of the year, which should lead to higher cash flow for the total year than year ago.","Our cash flow and strong balance sheet enables us to smartly invest in our future through investments in our supply chain, including construction of more efficient plants, and acquiring new businesses that adds to our portfolio of power brands. All of these factors give me great confidence about our ability to deliver our aggressive 2012 business targets despite the very tough business environment facing all companies these days.","In my biased opinion, no other consumer packaged goods company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to thrive in any type of business environment.","We were delivering exceptional EPS growth before the recession. We are delivering exceptional EPS growth during the recession. And we are taking actions to ensure that we continue to deliver exceptional EPS growth going forward, regardless of the future economic environment.","Let me switch gears now so that we talk about our outlook for the second half of 2012. As stated in the press release, as a result of the fact that our first half results were very strong, we remain confident that we can deliver our previously announced earnings per share estimate of $2.41 to $2.43, which is an increase of 9% to 10% over 2011 adjusted EPS numbers. We strongly believe that we can deliver this aggressive EPS target despite continued expected headwinds from higher commodity costs and weaker consumer demand.","Our confidence in delivering this aggressive EPS target is based on 2 key factors.  First, we strongly believe that we continue to deliver the market share gains in our power brands required to deliver our target of 3% to 4% organic growth. These share gains are expected to result from increased traction in our innovative new products, significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands and increased marketing spending behind our power brands in the second half of this year.","We achieved 6% organic growth in the first half of the year, and these 3 factors should contribute to continued organic growth in the second half of 2012, although this growth will not be as strong as the first half because we are up against strong organic sales in the second half of last year.","Second, we strongly believe that we can still deliver gross margin expansion within our targeted 25 to 50 basis points despite being down almost 100 basis points in the first half of 2012. Our gross margin expansion is expected to result from a wide range of initiatives that have already been implemented, as Matt highlighted earlier.","As a result of these factors, I feel highly confident that we can deliver diluted earnings per share growth of 9% to 10% for total 2012 on an adjusted EPS basis, which exceeds what most of our competitors are promising in this tough environment.","In conclusion, 2012 is shaping up to be a very challenging year due to weak consumer demand and high commodity prices. But when things get tough, you should place your bets on the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and a management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage their portfolio to deliver strong EPS growth.","That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My first question would be, were promotional levels up year-over-year? I mean, the negative price mix in the quarter was more than I thought, and I'm wondering if some of that was a shift from advertising to promotional spending more than you expected?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Alice, this is Jim. Not really, not really. Promotional spending was in line. Again, consumers continue to move down to the value brands, we keep benefiting from that. But really, promotional levels were fine. Pricing was a little bit below year ago, but nothing significant.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. And then to add to that, Alice, the household versus personal care mix is very skewed in the quarter.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","The promotional spending, did it take more off sales than it did a year ago?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","We don't think promotion is a factor in the story this quarter. It's really around the mix of the products.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. My next question is, you're expecting the third quarter to be a -- looks like 7% in the fourth quarter, up 13%, can you -- and that, just to get to the low end of your EPS guidance, can you explain why the shift to the fourth quarter within the second half? And also, could you comment on gross margins in the third quarter? Will they be up yet?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, we don't really look at it as a shift to the fourth quarter, Alice. As I said earlier, we have low marketing spend, less than 12% in the first half. So if we're going to be consistent with our marketing spend on a full year basis, we're going to have, average 14% marketing in the second half. So that's just math. As far as the EPS goes, we called $0.54 for the second quarter. So we beat it by $0.02, arguably because marketing was lower. So that $0.02 has to go somewhere, so it goes to the third quarter. So absent that, probably third quarter may be more like $0.60. So we're pretty relaxed about that. And as far as the fourth quarter goes, as far as year-over-year, fourth quarter year-over-year last 3 years has been up pretty high, 15% to 20% on an annual basis, so if you went back and looked at say, '09 to '10, '10 to '11 and now '11 to '12. So from our point of view, it's all in line.  What is your gross margin question?","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Your gross margins, you're expecting to be up for the year. Of course, they were down in the first half. So will they start being up year-over-year in the third quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, absolutely.","James R. Craigie","Alice, this is Jim. Let me add to our marketing spending. If you look at our year-ago numbers, we spent more marketing in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. We're kind of reversing that this year. We're going to spend more marketing \"spending\" in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Still very high in the second half, but we're putting a very strong focus in the third quarter, because we got great distribution on new products. In some cases, faster than we got a year ago. And we're going to go out there and very strongly support that in the third quarter this year.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And is it fair -- you just said that you beat your own guidance in the second quarter maybe because marketing was lower. Was it lower than you had originally expected? And if so, why?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Look, there's lots of factors, Alice. But if we're down -- we were down a little bit on marketing year-over-year, so we came in around 12.7%. So it's all a function of timing and when we want to spend the money. So we were having a good quarter, so we pushed it back to the third quarter.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then I have one final question. And that is you said that your high-margin personal care products were down 5.1% in the quarter. Could you tell us which products those were? And maybe that's Spinbrush, does that reverse in the third quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. It was Spinbrush, ORAJEL and Answer were the 3  that gave us trouble in the second quarter. But when you think about why is the second half going to be different for personal care than the first half? There's really 4 reasons for that. The first would be the new products. So you've heard -- you read about and you've heard Jim talk about Tooth Tunes and also the ORAJEL single dose. That's the new products. The second thing is we're building a lot of traction for our ARM & HAMMER ORAJEL sensitive toothpaste, as well as the TROJAN Charged, and also Vibes in bricks and mortar. So we're getting a lot of traction there and a good distribution. The third thing is the Q2 consumption actually outpaced our shipments. So when that happens, that actually bodes well for personal care. And last thing is really July is off to a pretty good start for personal care. So we have some confidence in the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I know last quarter you said that marketing would be 13% of sales this year, and I think you're still suggesting that. Is that right, you still think marketing is going to be 13% of sales in 2012?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, it will be close.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, I wanted to ask about the mix drag, right? And looking, Jim, to your point, right, I mean, this is a tough world out there, right? And people are trading down to your products, which is driving disproportionate household growth. I know the mix piece is getting -- is going to get a little better in the back half, but has your thought process evolved at all on that? And that, I mean, do you -- are you looking at mix as something that might be more of a permanent drag, not withstanding all the personal care activity? I mean, you just think it's going to be a longer drag than expected? Or do you still think it's sort of a temporary phenomenon?","James R. Craigie","I think it's temporary, Chris. We were pleasantly surprised by the numbers we got on the household side in the first half. We knew we had good growth, but it exceeded our expectations. And as Matt told you, we've adjusted for that in the back half to reflect what we think is a better mix now knowing that, between household and personal care. And as Matt just told you, there's reasons why we think personal care would be stronger in the back half, which are very solid, and we feel very comfortable about. And as he said, Q2 consumption outpaced shipments which means we entered the quarter in a good inventory position. And as expected, July is off to a very good start across the board. So we feel very good. We looked at the past results very closely. You've seen what's happened on the mix issue, and adjusted for our back half forecast between household and personal care, given all the stuff that's going on, the higher marketing spending, the new products going out there, the traction we're gaining on the new products. So we think we have a much tighter handle on the whole mix issue in the back half quarters. That's why we have great confidence around the calls we're making.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And just one last one. I think in Q2 of last year, you called out the vibrations category at a $1 billion, then it went to $700 million in Q3, $500 million at CAGNY. I think you said $300 million today. So is there a change in behavior going on? Or are you guys just kind of taking a fresh look at the numbers on that category?","James R. Craigie","It's a fresh look, Chris. It's a hard category to estimate because a lot of it is done in nonmeasured channels. So we keep trying to get close to this channel. We could be off by a factor of 2. We've been kind of just downsizing it just to kind of get a better handle on it. It's still an enormous category with no competition basically. And we're coming out there and doing very well. We're very happy with our results. It's a slow build because a lot of it is mom-and-pop stores versus big chains initially in that. So we're building very nicely. We're happy with the results. We're just trying to be more conservative on this category call. But again, this is a category we basically face no branded competition. So it's just all gravy to us, and we're slowly gobbling it up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just first, one clarification. I think you said, Jim or Matt, that marketing spending will be higher in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. That seems to be a bit of deviation from historical precedence.","James R. Craigie","Yes, that's true. That's true, Joe. It's just -- we're again, very happy with the distribution gains that we've made so quickly on a lot of our new products. And in light of that, we're pulling forward some marketing spending for the third quarter to take advantage of that. Normally, the new product build would probably not get the full distribution by the middle of the third quarter. This time, we pretty much got where we want by the early part of third quarter. So we want to support those new products so we're pulling forward the marketing spending, and we feel very confident that will drive some really good results in the third quarter and then fourth quarter will be strong, too. Like Matt said, our spending in the back half of the year is going to be higher than the front half and that should really drive the power brand share gains we want.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of the overall pricing and promotion environment, what's going on, I guess, in powder detergent, oral care? You're hearing, obviously, a handful of your competitors doing some pricing actions there. And also, are you guys prepared for the higher merchandising in the laundry unit dosing?","James R. Craigie","Yes. We're fully aware of what's going on out there in pricing. Our competitors have announced their actions. We have held our pricing on the powder side. We still have a very strong advantage. The only sad news about that is the powder category now has become more expensive than the liquid category, which is a change. In the past, powder was less expensive. But because of the actions in that category and the aggressiveness in the liquid side, powder detergent is really hurting. The latest quarter consumption dollars on this powder category, for the category, we're down almost 19%. That was the worst quarter in -- I can go back over a year or 2. So powder has really taken on the chop from all the activity in liquid and the new unit dose. So we'll see what happens. We've done very well. We were the only company -- we grew share in liquids, powder. And obviously, unit dose was a pure plus. So we're the only guys who grew share across all 3 categories. But the powder category has taken a real beating right now given where it is. But we feel very competitive. We're in a good position, and the people keep trading down. They love ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent. They love the new product. Our powder is doing well. Unit dose is -- we're getting our fair share of that. But I've always had my fears about unit dose, that it's going to hurt the overdosing in the liquid category. And after 4 straight quarters where the category grew, the category liquid declined in Q2. I didn't like that. But we grew share enormously, record shares, I told you. And I -- the jury is still out on unit dose, but it is not off to a good start for the category.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just one last one in terms of uses of cash. I think you mentioned, obviously, cash flow is very strong in the first half and looking to be strong for the full year. And I think last call you said no more share repurchases after April. Is that still the case? And a dividend payout, I guess is now about 40%. So I would imagine, going forward, your dividend increases would probably follow earnings growth. Is that fair to say?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. Two things, Joe. One is with respect to share repurchase, that is correct. We don't anticipate any additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. As far as our payout goes, yes, our payout is 40% of earnings. Our historical practice has been to increase the dividend at the same rate as our annual earnings increase. But we don't make those decisions until the February announcement or the fourth quarter announcement each year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess I just want to first talk about the laundry growth. Did you give a number in terms of what the shipment trends in laundry was in the quarter?","James R. Craigie","Our numbers?","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, the actual -- within household products, up 10.5%. How much was -- what was the year-over-year increase in laundry as opposed to some of the other, cat litter, deodorizer? Was that double digit?","James R. Craigie","Yes, double digit. I'm trying to figure out what exactly the -- you asked for sales? We don't give sales by specific things. It was -- well, it was in the double digits, for sure.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess the follow-on question is really thinking about the back half of the year, where you do start to anniversary some tougher comps. How confident are you with some of the, as you said, some of the competitive actions that are out there, that if you look at it maybe on a 2-year stack rate, that the trends can really kind of stabilize here? And the reason why I say this is that personal care obviously has been a little bit more challenged, you do have some new innovation, but how confident are you that if the personal care sales don't deliver what you think they will, that laundry can continue to overcompensate?","James R. Craigie","Jason, I feel very confident. Household will continue to be strong. We've looked in great detail on our merchandising support in the back half, our marketing support, how our new products are doing, the distribution gains we've achieved. So even though we're comping huge growth in the back half of last year, we still feel solid about that. And the personal care stuff is really gaining traction. I think I told you, in Q2, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste grew more in consumption percentage basis than the leading toothpaste brand. The sensitive thing is off to a good start. The other new products are doing well. Tooth Tunes distribution results so far have been incredible. So we feel very well. And we exited with a low inventory position going into the back half. So the personal care is off to a really good start. So, I don't have a crystal ball of perfection but, boy, I'm feeling great about the second half of the year right now.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just with personal care, so is third quarter more about the sell-in and fourth quarter more about the sell-through?","James R. Craigie","Well, it depends. it's sell-in on the Tooth Tunes and the ORAJEL single dose cold sore product, new products. But on the stuff we launched in Q2, like the ARM & HAMMER ORAJEL toothpaste, Nair products, TROJAN Charged, those are out there. So it's kind of a mixed bag because some were launched in late Q1, early Q2. They've got full distribution now, and the other ones are just starting. But the Tooth Tunes we think will be pretty fast, because it's hot and the trade loves it. And ORAJEL single dose will be a little slower because it's just a slower category overall, and it's more towards the cold season in Q4. So -- but, just I'm really excited about the new products this year there. Obviously, over-delivering what we expected, which is great news, and I think it just makes for a good second half of the year.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The second question, just on the international and you're -- yes,  you're right, I think it was, the organic sales, it might've been negative for the first time in 6 years, I think. Europe is what, 6%, 7% of sales? I guess, can you talk about, I guess 2 things. One, can you talk about how Canada and Mexico are holding up? And two, should we expect that the whole international organic sales returns to positive trends in the third quarter? And if so, why?","James R. Craigie","Well, you can definitely expect the international to return to positive growth in the third quarter. We viewed that in great detail [ph]. We feel confident. Canada and Mexico. Mexico is very strong. We're doing terrific down in Mexico. We had a great quarter. Canada was a little short of expectations in Q2 based on some minor issues, which have been corrected. And we feel very good about our Q3 in Canada. In Europe, we put programs in place to deal with some of the competitive pricing stuff on oral care in there. So I feel we've dealt with the problems and look forward to international coming back to being a nice, solid contributor to our growth.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question is a housekeeping. Matt, you were talking about the equity in earnings of affiliates. Did you say it was going to be down $3 million year-over-year? There was a $3 million number you threw. So in 2011, it was $10 million. So are we looking at $7 million, or what was that $3 million?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, that's correct.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So it's going to be $7 million for the full year. So the back half will probably be only like $1 million in equity?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","I don't have the 4 quarters laid out in front of me, but you're correct on the full year basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So can you talk about what you're hedged and when the hedges start to roll off? Because I think September was kind of when you put in the hedges in last year. So how much of the gross margin that you guys are predicting for the back half of the year is sort of contingent on some of the hedges rolling off? And is it more than just diesel?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, we have -- 70% of our most volatile inputs are hedged for the second half, Bill. And it's not just diesel. It grows everything from surfactants, resins, soda ash, latex, palm fatty acid distillate  carbonates. There's 7 or 8 categories that we focus on. So we've got 70% of that hedged, so we have some sense of what our most volatile inputs are going to do. And as far as next year goes, we've been just doing some selective hedging of 2013 now, taking advantage of some of the dips that have happened over the last couple of months.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But it sounds like it's going to be favorable in terms of lower-price hedges rolling off in the back half. Was that one of your prepared comments, when you talked about the gross margin bridge?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Remember, we came into the year, we were more than 50% hedged, almost 60%. So that was on a full year basis, so that's always been in place.","James R. Craigie","The point is, Bill, we're pretty heavily hedged in the back half of this year, so there should be no surprises on us of gross margin from any commodity actions because we're pretty well locked in the back half.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then on the SG&A side, how much of the reduction was reversal incentive compensation? Only because I don't -- you're probably not going to hit the gross margin target again. And I know that's about 1\/4 of your incentive comp target.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","No, none was reversal, Bill. We -- because we're doing so well on other factors right now, we didn't reverse any of our incentive comp.","James R. Craigie","Yes, it's a composite, Bill, for 4 other metrics as you know.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a sort of strategic question on the whole pods thing. I mean, can you maintain the price gap to the competitor when you have to put the same level of actives into the product? Does that make sense?","James R. Craigie","Bill, we're putting out a product that's comparable to our liquid product on the unit dose side. And it's doing extremely well in the marketplace. We got our fair share of the category. We're very happy with the results. I'm just, again, disappointed that it's -- the category hasn't shown any growth. In fact, slight decline from year ago, which is not good. But we're very successful. We're growing share across all 3 segments. But it's just -- I was always fearful of the impact and the lack -- on the -- it cannibalizes liquid, you lose the overdosing effect in liquid. I got no definite proof yet, but it appears to be signs of that as the overall category is down. Overall total dollars is down.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. But won't the mix benefit of the profit of the pods offset that? Sort of like the profit pull from the industries actually go up, right, because the raw materials associated with making a pod is a heck of a lot lower than that with like a big plastic container of laundry detergent?","James R. Craigie","That's the hope, Bill. But right now, I think everybody had start-up costs on the pod. Everybody's doing a lot of merchandising on the pod. Everybody's doing a lot of couponing on the pod. And we'll see what happens when consumers get beyond all these trial offers as to what the end result is between liquid, powder and unit dose, especially with the potential loss of overdosing, which could hurt the liquid category. So I can say the jury is still out on unit dose, but it's not off to a great start.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just lastly, housekeeping kind of  thing. But what was the price increase in cat litter? And do you guys lead that or follow it?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","We were 6%, and we followed.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ.","Ian J. Gordon - S&P Equity Research","I just wanted to -- in terms of the laundry detergent again. Can you comment maybe on the trajectory of the sales and market share through the quarter? Because I think when you look at the scanner data and from some of the commentary from the big competitor there who seems to be a little bit more focused and maybe even more desperate, it sounds like things have been shifting their way later in the quarter. So could you comment on that?","James R. Craigie","Our big competitor seems to focus on one month. We focus on 3. Our 3 months results are very strong. Like I said, we had record share in ARM & HAMMER liquids. The only guys to grow our liquid consumption, our liquid share. Powder, we grew share also, despite the declining category. And we're getting our fair share of unit dose. So I'll take a long-term trend any day over a one-month trend. And knowing what we know about Q3 as far as our merchandising support and everything else, we feel very good about our laundry detergent business. You just can't beat the pricing advantages we've always had in this category. Consumers recognize, they're trading down. They're loving our products, and they keep buying more and more. And so I know the hopes from big competitors are out there, but I feel very confident we're going to continue to have very strong results in the overall detergent category.","Ian J. Gordon - S&P Equity Research","And then on the free cash flow conversion, I think, in my view that's one of the things that helps support the premium multiple. And I think a lot of that's been dependent on your ability to reduce working capital over the last couple of years. So I'm just wondering sort of what your outlook is on that going forward, and how much more can you continue to take out of the system?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, we have a focus on cash conversion cycle in the company. And for our cash conversion cycle, we focus on is trade receivables, inventory and trade payables. So if you went back a few years, we were in the mid-50s for a number of days for cash conversion cycle. And today we're under 30, and we target to be under 30. And we still have more room to go, not so much in the receivable side, but we think we can be a little more creative in inventory and also, as we get larger, to continue to extend terms on the payable side. So we do think there's some room left to go. And in the meantime, we plan on growing the company and keeping working capital flat, so we can keep throwing off increasing amounts of free cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Could you talk about the dynamics in the condom category as Durex seeks to gain share in the U.S.? Promotional activity, is that going up? Because it seems like your market share has been under pressure there. And I'm wondering if -- I guess I'm surprised that it wasn't one of the factors you mentioned in the decline in personal care sales.","James R. Craigie","Connie, we feel very good about the condom category. The new product Charged is doing exceptionally well out there. It's already heading towards one of the top 3 condoms in the marketplace. Our share is up in the category. And don't forget, when you're 75, I think we hit a 76, I think the latest monthly results would've been our highest ever, I think, in condom category as the Charged condom gains momentum. We feel great. So I -- our condom is good. The talk from Durex has been all talk so far. We have seen no sign in the marketplace of anything in the nature of new products or in the nature of merchandising or advertising support. I highly respect that company. And they've had terrible problems in the condom business for the past year with supplier problems. I think they've hit a record low share in the States. So I think, in some sense, they're trying to come back. But usually, when they fight, it's the other 2 guys who just battle it out and trade share. And we are, by far -- I think we spend 90% of the advertising dollars in the category, over 75 share, with the best new product. So they largely copy us, and we see nothing that gives me any concern about the condom category. And we're building now to the white space entries in the vibrators, and we have a lot more interesting things to come. So -- I'm a very big fan of my condom business, and gross margins have been growing there. We've done a lot of improvements in our factory to help gross margin in that category. So very, very happy with our condom business.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then just a follow-up, a kind of clarification to the question that was asked earlier about the size of the vibrations category, and it went from, in your commentary, from $1 billion down to $300 million over the course of maybe 18 months. Was that -- are all of the numbers you've given us consistently retail sales or are they manufacturer's sales or a combination of both?","James R. Craigie","Connie, they're mostly retail sales. And again, it's very hard to measure, because so much of the business is done in mom-and-pop stores out there, done online, and it's not measured -- very little of it is measured by the Nielsens or IRIs of the world. So we, over time, as we get to know these channels better, attend the trade shows and everything else to try to get a handle on it. But I'll still take -- don't forget, condoms in total is a $350 million category. So this is still a great category. We have like over 60% share within the category on the premium condom -- sorry, premium vibrator side. We have a program going on in New York City in the next 2 days. We're going to give away, I believe, over 10,000 vibrators on the streets of New York, so stay tuned. And lots of fun stuff ahead as we continue to grow this category.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just first wanted to follow up again on personal care. Because I looked back at the commentary you guys have shared in the last couple of quarters about that widening gap between household and personal care growth. And the personal care business has been getting worse, right? So it was down about 30 basis points in the fourth quarter, down 2.5 and now down 5. So I understand why you're confident it gets better because of new product activity and the inventory position. But what are the pieces that have actually been getting worse? And are you thinking that if those pieces are getting better, why?","James R. Craigie","Lauren, this is Jim. One thing we haven't talked much about, but we did a whole restructuring of our toothpaste business in ARM & HAMMER in the past year. We had changed the sizes. We lined priced it. It wasn't lined priced before. We improved the packaging. And we also came out with a new product, ARM & HAMMER and ORAJEL sensitive toothpaste. And that's all paying off now. So we very much have fixed our ARM & HAMMER toothpaste business, which is the biggest part of the whole oral care business. TROJAN, again, the new product launch has been great. Nair has had a good year. Nair is kind of -- Nair share is down because a big competitor entered with a very high-priced product in the depilatory category. We had great results for the category. We didn't grow as much as the category growth, but our consumption is up, and our shares are up, and our sales are up. So we feel good about that. The problem in the category has largely been ORAJEL, which is a very high-margin product. We've been hit a bit harder than we expected by private label on that side of the business. And we're fighting back hard to fix that problem right now. But overall, we fixed the toothpaste business. TROJAN business continues to do very well. Nair business is doing well. ORAJEL business is the problem. We're in the process of fixing that right now. And it caused a bit of a hit because it's such a high-margin product for us.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And so the -- I guess that's really helpful. On the ARM & HAMMER toothpaste, with that restructuring of the brand, was that part of the drag on sales over the last year, because there were some timing of shipments and working through excess inventory before you launched new packaging, things like that?","James R. Craigie","Definitely. It was -- again, the product line used to be at 2 or 3 different price points. We lowered the price on some, raised the price on others to be all the same price point, which is really doing much better. We changed the packaging. So there was a bunch of changes going on which impacted that key brand over the past year, but now I feel very good. That business should have very strong results going forward as shown by the Q2 results.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the ORAJEL new product that you guys have coming out, the single dose cold sore, is that something that, technology-wise, is very difficult for private labels to match? Is there -- is it sort of a defensible new product that helps you widen that gap again?","James R. Craigie","Yes, that [indiscernible] case has some proprietary technology that we purchased from outside of our house. And it's a terrific product that I challenge anybody who suffers from cold sores to try it. The results are far better than anything else available in the marketplace.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","It's patented, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then also, just Specialty doesn't get a lot of attention from all of us, but pretty dramatic swing quarter-to-quarter. So just how should we be thinking about the rest of the year, pricing versus volume, or is the business going to be growing or down as it was in the first quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Lauren, we expect the second half to be up for the Specialty Products business. You may recall that half the business is exposed to dairy. So, obviously, we get a lot of questions about what's the effect of the drought on dairy and the use of our products. The answer to that is because our products increase the yield of milk in dairy cows, it's actually in more demand because of the drought than if there weren't going to be a drought. So it's kind of a good news, bad news thing. So yes, to answer your question, we expect to be up in the next couple of quarters organically year-over-year.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then finally, on international, you told us it's U.K. and France -- it's just, I looked back, I can't find another quarter except for September, I think it was '08, when the international business volume was negative, and there, it was only like 30 or 40 basis points. So it feels like it there was a very dramatic swing there. It was really just competitive pricing activity in 2 categories and 2 countries and that was enough?","James R. Craigie","That was the majority of them, Lauren, yes. That was the key hit. And it surprised us a little bit. The oral care wars in the U.K. have been unbelievable, prompted by a big competitor's entry there, overpromising what they would do and then continuing to promote at ridiculous prices. And we've fixed that now. And then Nair is a big business in France for us. And one of our key competitors again did some very aggressive pricing, which we've now addressed.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So when you say you've addressed, are you just matching the level of promotional activity?","James R. Craigie","Yes, we are, which should improve our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On cat litter, and I apologize if I missed part of this, but in your press release, you cited that you have strong volumes in the ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter side of the business, but a competitor mentioned that they had gained share. Jim, can you just kind of reconcile what's going on there? And then, as it relates to your unit dose laundry, how is that performing against your expectations? Again, as you already mentioned, it's coming from -- basically it's all incremental at this point. How is that going against expectations?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Tim, I don't know what exactly the competitor said, but we are kicking butt in the cat litter category, continuing to kick butt in the cat litter category. We've had 2 big winner innovative products in a row between Double Duty and this new Ultra Last. The distribution gains have been terrific. The consumption gains have been terrific. The sales gains, all double digits. I mean, just in the latest quarter, to pick up 2 share points in the category like this, which has very formidable competitors, is outstanding. So we just -- like I said, we've had 34 consecutive quarters of sales gains in this category. It's something we didn't --  we only entered in 1998 as an extension of ARM & HAMMER. So again, I don't know what the competitor said, but we are really doing outstanding in cat litter.","On unit dose, a few facts on unit dose. In total, across the whole detergent category, unit dose is only about 5% of sales in total. For competitors who have a unit dose product, it's about 8% to 10% of their sales. And again, it's early in the phase. I don't want to downgrade it too much right now. But it's more promotional activity and advertise support will happen on this across the category in the second half of the year. But it's been 2 quarters since this product was launched. Usually, you'll see real strong results from the first 2 quarters. But like I said so far, it's really not making me happy to see that the total laundry category between liquid, powder and unit dose, if you add them all up in dollars, the consumption is down. So that doesn't do much to help the category, as far as my eyes, and it's hurting the liquid category. And the powder is now a more expensive product than liquid based on the pricing actions in both sides out there. So I think we're doing great. I mean we're gaining share in all segments. We're getting our fair share of unit dose. But I sure wish the category would go back to growth again, particularly in the big segment, which is liquid laundry, which after 4 quarters of good, solid growth, almost 5% in the last 2 quarters, was down 2% the latest quarter in consumption for total category dollars. That is not a happy result to me.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And again, you've talked about how you've got a lot of new products, especially on the consumer side, coming here in the back half of the year. You've shifted your marketing spend into the third quarter versus fourth quarter historically to sort of get out at the front of that. Given all that and given what's been alluded to a large competitor, you want to call it desperation, you want to call it hard change of course, whatever, however you want to frame it, but they're going to be more aggressive in changing their course correction here. How -- to what degree you can, how have you planned and factored that into the back half marketing spend plans, promotional plans?","James R. Craigie","Well, first of all, Tim, I would say we talk and we deliver, and they talk and they don't deliver. I would tell you, we, we're fully cognizant. We're fully aware of that competitor and respect them with the greatest degree given their size and scale. But our brands are in great shape. They've been continuing to do well. The economy plays to our hand. We've looked very intently at our merchandise support in the back half versus a year ago, and it's very strong. Really, the competitor -- we're not seeing any promotional spending changes from them so far. We're probably seeing some advertising increases, some of which are aimed at us, but are very weak in my mind. And very interesting that a larger player talks about a smaller player in their ads. That's a new change. Thank you very much for the free advertising support. So I mean we're very cognizant of it. We watch them every day, but I -- we've been beating them consistently over time, and we think we'll continue to beat them in the back half of this year.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, on the acquisition front again. Thankful that you guys have been very disciplined, and we continue to appreciate that. But just maybe just update the framework of how you see this, especially, again we've been at this road before. Maybe the clock ticking on potential sellers from a tax perspective by year end. But maybe just give us an update there on how you see the current environment from an opportunistic standpoint?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Tim, we continue to be very disciplined. We continue to look for good acquisitions. We work hard on it, but we're not going to make one until we see the right one out there. And I thought the environment was favorable in the past, and I continue to think it is favorable. But there's been, overall in the whole industry, a pretty low level of activity so far. But other than that, I can't comment or disclose anything related to M&A transactions until there's something definitive out there. But we continue to work hard against it, and so far, nothing to report.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch on -- you guys generate a ton of cash. And so I was curious given that you don't intend to repurchase additional shares throughout the remainder of the year, where do you intend to -- or how do you intend to utilize that cash? And secondly, given the decline in the stock price this morning, whether you'd reconsider repurchasing shares throughout the remainder of the year?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, this is Matt. It's pretty well documented what our destinations are for cash. Number one is TSR-related acquisition. So this is an acquisitive company. We acquired 7 of our 8 power brands since the year 2000. So we're always looking for something to add to our portfolio, and we've very strict criteria around that. The number two destination is new products, investment in new products. The third would be base CapEx. The fourth is returning cash to shareholders. And fifth would be debt reduction. And debt reduction would be last right now, simply because we're only levered 0.4x debt to EBITDA. And as far as the share price today, that's today. We feel great about the second half. We anticipate a high-quality second half with gross margin expansion and high marketing spend. And we're going to be hitting our numbers for the year with 9% to 10% earnings growth.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","With regards to acquisitions, do you feel that the environment is more or less favorable in the U.S. versus abroad?","James R. Craigie","That's a one hard one, Erin. It's -- no, I really -- I think it's about the same on both sides. I know there is a lot more talk about tax law changes in the U.S., which could influence some sellers. But we're a North American-centric company. We do look everywhere, but we tend to focus a little bit more on North America. And I would say it's pretty much same outlook. I think it's somewhat positive or should be somewhat positive, but really not much has happened so far in the category or in the overall the CPG business, I mean.","Operator","The next question is from Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. On retailer inventories, Jim, I was wondering if just given what's going on in the environment, deteriorating consumer confidence, if you're noticing any change with retailers in terms of their inventory buying patterns, at least in the near term here. And the second question is, just curious on when liquid laundry compaction happened last time, what was the actual impact on consumption or dosing, if you could just kind of frame it so we can think about pods in that context?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Nik, on retail inventory, nothing major. It's nothing overall. I think retailers understandably are struggling in this difficult economy. But we're not hearing or seeing anything broadscale on inventories out there. Little things ebb and flow, but nothing substantial. That's an interesting question on liquid laundry compaction. I'd honestly, Nik, have to go back and check the notes on that to give you an accurate answer. Maybe we can follow up and give you an answer on that one, but I'd have to go back and check on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Leigh Ferst with Wellington Shields.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","My question is about Tooth Tunes. And as I recall there were some issues in getting it to launch, but it sounds like you're really excited about it. And I just want to make sure you're -- if you could just quickly review what those issues were and how they were resolved? And also my impression is it's not a huge category. But there's a lot of excitement around it. And I'm wondering if you have line extensions planned if you meet your target sell-in.","James R. Craigie","Yes, I mean the details -- last year, was a minor technical issue. And we don't like to launch products unless things are perfect, so we held back on it. And the product's in perfect -- We already are shipping it. It's great. It works beautifully. This isn't -- Tooth Tunes is a manual toothbrush. And manual toothbrushes is an $800 million category in this country. So that's huge. And we think we really got a unique product. It's proprietary technology. The last time, this was -- Hasbro initially had this product about 5 years ago. In its first year of very limited distribution, it did about $50 million in gross sales. I'm not going to predict to you what we expect on it, but the distribution results have been very strong to-date, and it's just a very unique product. If you follow any kind of consumer packaged goods business, there are some universal appeals out there. And music is something which has a universal appeal in almost any category you go out there. So we really think this will kind of revolutionize toothbrushing, especially for young kids. As far as future line extensions, definitely. If this thing does as well as we think, we can definitely target older age groups and be very selective of the music. So we already have those plans in place for next year. I don't want to reveal them at this point in time, but we have some very exciting new news in that respect coming out next year.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","I heard about some rock 'n' roll, but maybe you're not ready for that. And on the question -- I wanted to go back to the question about the mix. Is there anything unusual in how you measure your price mix versus your volume? And also, are you -- how do you look at organic growth? Do you -- are you happy to get all this volume even if you give back some of it in price and mix? How do you look at that tradeoff?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, you're right. It's a good news, bad news thing. So our household products are typically 15%, 20% lower gross margins than personal care. So yes, when the volume is really going great on the household side and personal care is suffering, the result is obviously pressure on your gross margins, and then a giveback on top line as well. So the good news is that we have such a balanced portfolio between value and premium that we're able to sustain our long-term targets of TSR, total shareholder return.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","But your -- is your target on organic growth overall, and whether it comes from volume or pricing mix?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. The 3% to 4% organic growth is an all-in number. That's the evergreen target for top line organic sales growth, volume and price.","Operator","That concludes our call. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Jim Craigie.","James R. Craigie","Thank you all very much for taking the time to be with us today. I would just wrap up by saying to you is we're very pleased with the solid Q2 results we've had. We honestly feel we have the right brands at the right price in this environment. We had very positive trends on 7 of 8 key business factors: the higher revenues, the more marketing spending in total dollars than year ago, higher shares on 5 of our 8 power brands, lower SG&A spending, higher adjusted EPS, higher income from operations and higher cash flow. I really think you can't beat that, scorecard is good. The only issue is lower gross margins driven by product mix, but we already have already programs in place to deliver higher gross margin in the second half. So we feel very, very confident about delivering our annual target of our -- on organic growth gross margin EPS.","And let me just say, for those of you who sold Church & Dwight today, good luck with finding a better investment because you won't. So thank you very much for your time.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5147":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you, operator. Okay, welcome everybody and everybody that's joining online. We have the whole management team here with us today. We appreciate the opportunity to tell the Church & Dwight story.","I'm going to provide some color on five of our categories. I'm going to talk about our 2017 innovation and consumer insights that led to that innovation. If you read the press release, you know we closed a couple of bolt-on acquisitions recently. So, I say a few words about that.","Rick is going to get up and give us the thinking on 2017 and then we'll have Q&A with the whole management team.","Okay. Here's the safe harbor statement, which I encourage everybody to read and let's just jump right in. So, for those of us who know us, or know the story, but if you're new to the story, we started in 1846 with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Today we're a $3.5 billion diversified company with dozens of brands and we do on the slide \u2013 too fast.","Here we go. Okay. We have 10 brands, we're a little bit out of sequence there. We have 10 brands that represent 80% of our revenues and profits and we're a serial acquirer. So those of you who know us, the only brand that we had in the year 2000 was ARM & HAMMER and since then 9 of our 10 brands have been acquired. So, we have a long history of acquisitions. If you go back to 2004, you can see our sales were $1.5 billion and today we're a $3.5 billion company.","And we have a very specific acquisition criteria. Just to kind of roll through them, we buy number-one or number-two brands, high-margin brands, we like asset-light businesses and we're able to leverage our extensive supply chain, which I'll say a little bit more later on and these brands always deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. Keep moving. Okay. So, we regard ourselves as an acquisition platform. So it's been part of our story over the past 15 years that we acquire businesses but also on top of that we have organic growth. The businesses we acquire we grow, we get operational efficiencies and we have a stellar acquisition track record and we have a fabulous balance sheet which will be plus-rated.","Okay. We're primarily a U.S. company, so there's two good things about that. We have less exposure than others to currencies and the other positive is that we have the opportunity to grow international and you can see over the past couple of years, we had stellar results internationally. Okay. We're pretty balanced, right, so we split household and personal care pretty much 50-50 and then we have a specialty products business which is primarily bulk sodium bicarbonate and we have an animal nutrition business as well. And we've delivered stellar results to our shareholders over time, you can see on this slide.","Okay. I'm going to talk about five categories now, so I want to \u2013 it's instructional. So, we're trying to see what's going on. I'm going to showcase our 2017 innovation. I'm going to start with laundry, right.","So, laundry has been a growing category and the growth has been driven by unit dose over time. So, if you go from left to right on this slide, so the leftmost side of this slide is a four-year look. You see 2013 and 2014 the category was down and then started to grow in 2015 and 2016. So, let's take a closer look at 2016, look at the quarters. So Q1, you had an unsustainable organic growth of plus 6%, what does that mean, it means it's going to be a tough comp for the first quarter of 2017.","Q4, you see there's a slowdown, right. So, this is the first quarter by the way in two years that have negative price in this category and it's concentrated in the liquid part of the category. So, let's take a look at that. So, here is liquid again, left to right, similar trend. Down in 2013 and 2014, up 2015 and 2016 and a similar trend for 2016 quarters if you go left to right.","So, let's look at the fourth quarter of 2016 for liquid. So, you have negative price mix of almost 3%. So, what is driving that? So, let's take a closer look, so let's look at the competitor activity in the fourth quarter. So, you have elevated levels of promotion in Q4. So, the category sold on deal is normally mid-30s. The Simply Tide dialed it up to 60% in the fourth quarter. Sun also took it up to 43%. ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, both in the 30s.","So, we didn't promote nearly as much as our competitors in the fourth quarter. Despite this level of spend, so ARM & HAMMER laundry continued to grow share in the fourth quarter. XTRA is where we have the share issue. So, two brands up, this is full-year now, so ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN up in 2016, XTRA down. The good news on XTRA is that we grew net sales and gross profit in 2016.","Now, let's look at the share story. So, XTRA has been the drag on share, ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN up. Remember, this is only measured channels, too. So, ARM & HAMMER laundry had a very strong year in non-measured channels, especially in club, and that's not reflected in Nielsen.","Okay. Let's talk about unit dose. So, unit dose in 2015 was 14% of the category; in 2016, it's 16% of the category. So, here's the unit dose category trend. You can see 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016. And so, we're up small numbers initially, so big growth in 2013, but it's sort of leveled out into low 20s growth as a category. You can see the quarters on the right-hand side of this slide here for 2016.","So \u2013 and this is our history now. So, you can see we have bumbled along here for a couple of years, and in 2016, we finally got some traction. So, in late 2015, we introduced bi-layer powder, and we also introduced a two-chamber pod. So, we got some traction and now it's starting to show up in our shares. So, from a share perspective, we're making progress. So, up 30 bps in 2016, 3.7% going to 4% so the winners were Church & Dwight and Sun, the losers were Procter and Henkel in pods in 2016.","Okay. So, we expect to make much more progress in pods in 2017 with our new triple-chamber pod. So, multiple chambers communicate multiple benefits to consumers.","Now, let's move on to litter. So, litter again a growing category historically. Here's the last four years, 2013 through 2016. Volume was most of the category growth by the way in 2016 of 4.4%. And we have a long history of innovation. So, we have a 12% CAGR. This is at retail sales, but in ARM & HAMMER, litter grew approximately 3% of retail in 2016, and consumer insights drive our innovation. So, the original CLUMP & SEAL was driven by the desire for odor control. This has been a huge winner for us.","Then certain consumers told us that they were concerned about bacterial odors, so that was the origin of CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. And the latest, which Lou took you through before we started this presentation, and we do some more now, cleaning the litter box is a nightmare for consumers.","So, today we're introducing ARM & HAMMER, CLUMP & SEAL SLIDE. So, cat owners love this product. There are three great benefits, the litter slides right out of the box, there's no scrubbing and it doesn't stick to the pan. We have a few commercials to run for you now.","[Video Presentation] (08:31-09:16)","Okay, this is going to be a big winner for us in 2017. Okay. Vitamins is another growth area for us. So, here's the adult vitamin category over the last four years. I could see that also was a big grower initially, but kind of slowed down as the category's gotten bigger, but an 18%, 19% grower in the past year.","So, if you look at the form, so that \u2013 how is the transition from pills and capsules going to gummies these days. So, in 2012, it was 3% of the category, 2016 it's 11% of the category, and here's some factoids here. So, almost 70% of U.S. adults take a dietary supplement and of those, 75% take a multivitamin, and we are the number one gummy vitamin both in adult and in children's vitamins. And a new innovation for us, we're entering the energy category. So, less people say they need more energy, so one of our new product launches in 2017 is an energy gummy. So, we're entering the energy space with an energy gummy source from green tea and our new gummy has a great taste consistent with the VITAFUSION line.","Okay. Condoms. The condom category is beginning to shift to online. I want to show you some stats on this now for a second. So, here is the measured channel story over the last few years. You can see down 2013, flat 2014, down 2015, down 2016, yet TROJAN sales and gross profit are up single digits in 2016. So there's a shift to digital going on right now and the shift to digital is becoming increasingly part of the story for many CPG companies. So, 2017 we're introducing a condom aimed at the female buyer. One out of three condoms are purchased by women. So today, we're launching TROJAN XOXO. So, three features there: soft touch, aloe-based lubricant, a unique carrying case and we have more great news. TROJAN XOXO will be advertised on network television in 2017. So, let's hope this one will grow well now. You can roll the commercial.","[Video Presentation] (11:32-12:02)","Okay. Look for that on network television in 2017. Okay. Next stop, Dry Shampoo, so this is \u2013 Dry Shampoo is a superfast-growing segment of the hair care category, but this is all of shampoo now. If you look 2012 versus 2016, Dry Shampoo was only 1% of total shampoo; in 2016, it's 4%. And you've heard us talk about this before of this fabulous category to be in, so in 2012 at retail in the U.S. was $32 million; 2016, $115 million. So the question is, where can this go? And this will give you some sense for how fast it's growing, so this thing is going to double again.","So, just a little bit of context. In the UK, this is a $63 million category and the population of the UK is 60 million, so we have five times the population in the United States, so this has the potential of being a $300 million category. Today, only a $150 million category. And there's a big household penetration story here, so look at some of these statistics, so there are 125 million in the U.S. over the age of 18 and two-thirds don't wash their hair every day, but only 13% of that crowd uses dry shampoo. So, a lot of runway ahead of us here and we have the number one brand and we've been growing share as the category has been growing. So, it's just a fabulous story there.","And again, two more variants, keep expanding the line, we have new BATISTE there, it has a light scent, so it doesn't conflict with your perfume and then we have the fun one on the right-hand side of this slide, vibrant & fruity neon. Okay.","So, how we deliver as the company, if you're a shareholder, you're familiar with all of these things I'm going to run through right now, I'm not going to list them, but I'm going to bomb through them one by one. Okay. Very diversified product portfolio. You know the split, right, 60% premium, 40% value. So, how do we build our shares? Pretty simple formula, right. We have great innovation, we have super marketing and we have a great sales team to increase our distribution and that results in share growth.","Okay, innovation I ran through already. So, we have the triple-chamber pod in 2017, we have Slide, we have the energy gummy, we have XOXO and BATISTE. But we have lots of other innovation in in other categories that I'm not going to run through right now, but some of them are depicted on the screen.","And marketing spending, so we're the 18th largest advertiser in the United States. That comes as a surprise to some people. And our sweet spot is anywhere from 12% to 13% marketing as a percentage of sales and you can see the history here, 2013 through 2016. And there is continually a shift to digital. We talked about \u2013 I'm going to talk about litter in a second, but 2011, it was 13% and in 2016, it's 28% of our spend.","Here's a good illustration. So, this is the best illustration for us of the efficiency of digital. So, one-third of U.S. households own a cat. So, those are the people we want to target. So, what digital enables you to do is to segment, target, educate, and then engage in conversation on relevant websites like for example Pet360 and then to drive sales online. Yeah. Not only online, but also retail. Okay.","Distribution, you know we're a pretty transparent company. This is 2013 index versus 2016, how do we look distribution for some of our major brands. If it's plus or minus 10%, we have it in gray. We'll call it a wash and the rest are green. Okay.","Finally, share. So, I talked about transparency as a company, you won't find a score card in many CPG presentations. So, let's kind of roll down the page here. So, we had 4 out of our 10 power brands grew share in 2016, and these are measured channels only and as you know the non-measured channel is increasingly part of the story, but this is the information available to everybody through Nielsen.","Okay. So ARM & HAMMER, so the only ARM & HAMMER variant that declined in 2016 was litter. The winner in the litter category was Nestl\u00e9 with Tidy Cat, Clorox has been flat with their two brands and so we've lost some share, but the total brand for ARM & HAMMER grew sales and profits in 2016.","OXICLEAN, second one on the list, we had record share in the fourth quarter. TROJAN, again, net sales and profits were up, non-measured channels becoming a factor. Vitamins, a very good story for us. FIRST RESPONSE, we were hurt by some discounting in private label, we're turning that around. The fourth quarter for FIRST RESPONSE we had our highest quarterly share ever.","Nair, doing really well there for many years, we have Wax-Ready Strips that are growing in the category. XTRA, we talked about a dip. Skip down to Orajel, so this private label has been hurting us there and BATISTE has been a big winner. So, 4 out of 10, we hope to turn some of these around in 2017 with our innovation.","Okay. International growth, fabulous story for us. So, here's the picture, so you have eight flags up here, but we only have six countries. So, we have two new regional centers; we have one in Asia; and one in Central America. You may have heard us talk about this on previous calls that international is an area of investment for us for the past two years and for obvious reasons.","So, we have a fabulous track record in growing our top line in international. So, you can see and this is broad-based. So, you go from left to right, you can see the CAGRs country by country and all are positive. And the way we run the businesses by the way is in Europe, UK and France are combined. So, we really have five business units within international.","Okay, gross margin. Rick is going to talk about this a little bit later on, but gross margin is a big focus within our company. And we continue to grow year-over-year, 2014, 2015 and 2016. And what are the drivers for that? Number one is our continuous improvement program we call good to great. Second is supply chain optimization. What does that mean? Those are the plants that we've opened over the past couple of years. We have a new vitamin plant, we have a new West Coast plant that we opened up.","New products obviously is a driver because a lot of the new products that we've launched have higher gross margins than the products they're replacing. And finally, acquisition. So, we try to buy businesses that have higher than corporate gross margins. All right, and here's another secret weapon is that gross margin is 25% of our employees' annual bonus and that's one way we create alignment within the company. People know what gross margin is.","Growth through acquisitions, I listed those earlier, but I want to call one of them out, so that's the fourth one on the page there, we've leveraged CHD capital base. So, what does that mean? We can be agnostic about the businesses that we look at and that's because we can put the liquid in a bottle, powder in a box. We can handle gels, lotions, aerosols, regulated businesses and we have an extensive co-packer network.","So it gives us the confidence to look at a lot of acquisition candidates in various categories. Okay, some statistics then. What happens after you buy the brand? So in every case, we have higher shares, we grow share once we acquire a business. And a couple of ones that you saw on our press release, VIVISCAL and the J&J brand. So, VIVISCAL is a brand that's been around since 1997, 80% of the sales are in the U.S. and its three year sales CAGR is 30%. And so this is a complementary business to our growing hair business which is our BATISTE brand and the TOPPIK brand that we bought a year ago.","And then a couple of brands we bought from J&J, this adds scale to our international business. That's ANUSOL and RECTINOL. 90% of the business is in Canada, the UK, Australia and it's a perfect fit for our international business where we can add some scale. Okay. And then you saw this earlier, $1.4 billion company going to $3.5 billion over time. Okay. Free cash flow, Rick's going to talk about this a little bit later, but we have stellar free cash flow. This is one thing that I think a lot of our shareholders focus on, is that our cash earnings per share is significantly higher than our reported book EPS.","Overhead management, so we run a really tight ship at Church & Dwight. I mean, the only CPG company that's better than us at managing SG&A is Reckitt. Rick's going to say more about this later on to give you some insight into the components of SG&A. But for my part, I want to point out that we've been investing in international. I mentioned that earlier over the past couple of years, we're going to continue to invest in international. Second thing, you're thinking IT investments, we're no different than any other company, but we have an extremely productive employee base, we can become even more productive if you make this investment. And R&D, if it's a natural, this is where you want to continue to invest to drive your innovation.","Okay. So, we have a very simple incentive compensation plan and this is the secret sauce, right. So we have a financially literate company and we have four measures, right. We have sales, gross margin, cash from operations and EPS. And our long-term incentives are aligning with shareholders, it's only options. Okay.","And then, how we run the company? Okay. So, you know we focus on number-one brands, we like to be asset-light and we have a super workforce. If you had these three, which we do, you would have really good results. But when you lever \u2013 when you put on top of that the competency we have as a company to acquire businesses, integrate them, and create more value, you get fabulous shareholder returns.","Here's our evergreen model, it's unchanged, a 3% top line, 8% bottom line, and 50% operating margin expansion. Rick is going to spend a little bit of time on that. Cool, thanks. So, we talked about the evergreen model. Our geographic focus were mostly U.S., but we're investing more internationally. Our acquisition criteria we've reviewed, and the allocation of capital, which is very deliberate, Rick's going to run through this but from top to bottom those are in order, where we direct our cash flow. Okay. Rick, you're up.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you, Matt. I'm going to go through three things with you guys. First the quarter, then the full-year 2016 results, and then we'll go through, spend some time on the 2017 outlook. So, first off is the quarter, 2.7% organic sales growth. Remember our outlook was 1% to 2%, so we overdelivered on all three of the divisions, so that was a great result.","Consumer organic, which is the international and the domestic division added together, that was 3.5% for the quarter. Our organic growth like many quarters was largely volume-driven at 3.2%, gross margin was up 60 basis points. I have a separate slide on the gross margin bridge that \u2013 we'll talk through that. And then operating margin was up 50 basis points. EPS was up 7% to $0.44 and remember our outlook was around $0.42, so I'm just really pleased with that result.","So, you saw some late-breaking news in the release this morning, we announced that we're selling our Brazilian chemical business, and now there is a small charge in 2016 of $0.02, small charge in 2017 of $0.02, but at the end of the day that's a good thing for the company, it just allows us to be focused even more on our consumer business in Brazil, small business, but growing.","From a phasing perspective, organically, you can see the stair-step was going down through the quarters, but it's up in Q4, right. Remember our domestic, organically we were 0.8% in the third quarter, we were 2.7% in the fourth quarter. So, again going in the right direction.","We had solid growth throughout the year. This is the two-year stack of the consumer business, domestic plus international, 8% for the two-year number, 4% in 2015, 4% in 2016. You can see the second half is 6% to 7%, which is solid growth as well and that stair-step down is really \u2013 probably the most pertinent item is the laundry category, right. Laundry category averaged about 4% category growth in the first half; about 2%, which is probably more of a sustainable number, in the back half.","Okay. Turning to full year, so 3.2% organic, which is fantastic. Domestic was 3.1%, international was 10%, that's a high watermark for that division. Steve and his team did a great job. SPD was a 7% drag. We've been upfront on that all year long as milk pricing has been going down. But the good news is from Q3 to Q4 sequentially, milk pricing has gone up about 6% and you'll hear in our outlook that we expect growth out of that division in 2017.","Again, I'm going to defer the gross margin story for another slide or two. We had a bridge in the full year. Marketing was essentially flat at 12.2%, SG&A was up 50 basis points for all the reasons Matt laid out and also incentive comp as we had really strong cash flow, really strong margin and results overall. EPS was up 9%, $1.77, and cash is a little over $600 million and net adjusted free cash flow of 131%. So, Matt talked to you about the 6- or 7-year average of 120%, 130%, just phenomenal.","Okay. Here's the gross margin detail. If you look at Q4 commodities, it's flat, that kind of marks an inflection point for us, right. The whole year, commodities have been a bit of a tailwind, and you see that in the full year section. So, commodities are starting to turn a little bit, you're going to hear in 2017, we expect there to be some moderate inflation.","Productivity and manufacturing, that's the J&J program that Matt referenced, 100 basis points from there, plus margin accretive acquisitions offset by higher promotional volume and mix, and that's how you get 60 basis points for the quarter. For the full year, the 60 basis points from commodities and the productivity gain of 70 basis points essentially gives 120 basis points for the full year. So, just really, this is the biggest increase we've had in gross margin for a few years. So, very happy about that.","Okay. Free cash flow conversion, we talk about this all the time, we talk about cash all the time, and 120% is top of the consumer sector. Our peers average in general about 100%, some peers target about 90%. So to have 120% year-in, year-out, and 130% this year is a good result.","And how can we do that? Probably one of the biggest reasons that we can do that is the way we manage the balance sheet through our cash conversion cycle. That's inventory plus receivables minus payables. And so, we've gone from 52 days over the last seven years to 21 days. That's hundreds of millions of dollars out of the balance sheet that we can put to use, right. And we have aspirational goals of getting down to zero, and we do have some peers that have done that, actually gone negative. So, we try to look at that all the time.","So, I've said we had a strong balance sheet, we're 1.4 times levered, so we have a lot of capacity to do a lot of deals and to use our balance sheet in a good way. So, as an example we could do a $2.8 billion deal, and we believe it would maintain our credit rating at BBB+, which would be really important to us.","Okay, I'm going to spend about 5 minutes on this slide. This is the 2017 outlook, a lot of moving pieces, so I just want to make sure we're all grounded. So, first off, 3% for organic growth, right. That's right in line with our evergreen model. That breaks up 2.5% to 3% for the domestic business, 4% to 5% international and 2% to 3% for the SPD business. So, again, they return to growth in 2017.","So, the backdrop for the domestic business is we're assuming a little bit slower growth in categories, probably around 2%. So, to the extent categories do better, we'll do better and vice versa. All right. Gross margin is up 60 basis points despite moderate inflation, despite higher promotional spending expectations. So these, what I would think about that, is 40 basis points from the acquisitions, these gross margin accretive acquisitions, offset by 40 basis points of higher commodity cost, higher promotional spending, FX drag, it's like it's back to zero and then plus 60 basis points from productivity and just leveraging our volume. So, that's kind of the detail behind the gross margin outlook.","Marketing is up. We're spending back a little bit more money in marketing to help drive those new products and help drive the brands. SG&A is actually up 10 basis points, but you can be assured that we haven't lost our way there, right. We \u2013 our TSR model, evergreen model says we typically leverage that 20, 25 basis points. I'm going to walk you through what's going on behind the numbers there. Other income and expenses, a drag of $14 million, and behind that number is about $20 million of interest expense, right. Half of that's because of interest rates are going up and half of that is just having the debt \u2013 our debt expectations for the new deals.","For the tax rate \u2013 all the adjusted items exclude the three adjustments we've talked about before; the pension, the Brazil, and the stock accounting FASB change. So, we're up 7% and that includes the higher marketing, that includes the slight drag from acquisitions and you might ask why do we have a drag from acquisitions. Well, these small deals are very global in nature. So, there's lots of countries involved. So we have to have transition services agreements all over the world as we integrate these things. So that's really why we have a drag.","On a reported basis, we're at $1.73 midpoint and that includes the Brazil charge, it includes the UK pension contribution. We're out of the pension business, right. That's a great fact. And then of course the new stock option accounting.","And I just want to draw your attention to, we said in the release as well the timing of EPS, right. We said roughly all of our EPS growth will come in the second half of the year. We're moving marketing dollars out of the second half and back into the first half. Over time those numbers would just creep up over time and we want to reallocate and do what's right for the business.","Okay. So I'll just flip through some of the key metrics really quick. So our track record on organic sales, right. Solid track record from 2012 to 2017 and we've been between 3% and 4% over that timeframe and again in 2017 we're calling 3%.","Gross margin is the hallmark of this company and it drives a lot of value. It drives a lot of cash earnings for the company and you can see the stair-step up all the way to 46.3%. So, great progress.","Marketing spend has been pretty consistent and Matt alluded to that between 12% and 13%, we think that's the right number and again it's another year of increased marketing. Now on SG&A, I'll just take a minute to discuss this. So, you can see on reported basis that SG&A is up 60 basis points from 2014 to 2017. But I want to show you what it is on a cash basis. So, on a cash basis, we're pretty much flat. So if you look at 2014 to 2017, 11% to 11.1% and if you just take a second and look at the change of 2016 versus 2017, we're up 10 basis points on a reported basis, but we're down 20 basis points on a cash basis.","So, we haven't lost our way. We have a mindset in this company, we've been doing zero-based planning for many, many years and so we have such a good hold over what our SG&A dollars are doing.","On operating margin, this is a great result, 21.3%, a lot of personal care-type companies are trying to get to the low 20s, so we feel good about that number. EBITDA margin, it's a good surrogate for cash and cash earnings. This drives a lot of value. We've gone from the low-20s over time to the mid-20s and this is fantastic. EPS growth, so everything that came before is what leads to EPS growth and so we've had a few years of high single-digit EPS growth, 9% this year, 7% is the call for next year, $1.89.","Okay. Allocation of capital, this is one of the most important things that we discussed, this doesn't change though. Number one far and away is accretive M&A, so we spent a lot of time, this management team spends a lot of time looking at deals. Number two is new product development, Matt walked you through a lot of those. Number three is CapEx for organic growth. Number four is return of cash to shareholders through dividends or through buybacks. And number five is debt reduction. And of course, if we did do a big deal number five would move to number one.","We're not a capital-intensive company, we've walked through this many times, but our outlook for 2017 is around $55 million. If you take out the one-timers like capacity, installations, we bump around between $50 million to $60 million, so our outlook is right in line with our past practice. We announced this morning that we're increasing the dividend by 7%, high single-digit increase which is great, 40% payout, we're still right at that type number, this is 116 consecutive years of dividend.","And I would be remiss if I didn't give you a comment or two on the proposed tax reform. I would say you guys know 80% of our sales are in the U.S., about 90% of our pre-tax income is in the U.S. 95% of our products sold in the U.S. market are sourced and produced domestically, so about 5% are imported. And so net-net imports and exports largely wash and it's kind of neutral. The best thing that could happen far and away for Church & Dwight is just the general corporate tax rate being lowered. But that's a quick perspective, we get that question a lot, so I want to give context.","And with that, I think we'll invite the management team up and we'll take any sell-side questions we have.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. All right, gang. Come on up. It's not often you get the entire management team, so don't be bashful to ask some questions. We have virtually every function represented here. They're bumping around here. We had a terrific fourth quarter and just a really fabulous 2016. We're optimistic about 2017. So now we'll take your questions. Okay, Bill.","Question-and-Answer Session","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Two Bills there. Bill Schmitz?","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you guys bridge the organic growth and that negative 1% Nielsen to the roughly 3% in the consumer domestic business you did?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I used to masquerade as the finance guy. So, I'm going to...","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I remember, yeah.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","...let the finance guy do that.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think I might \u2013 yeah, no problem. So, you'll see there in the Nielsen data for example, before we paid out, has been relatively weak and that's really track channels. So, we were slightly negative in track channels. We said in the release though about \u2013 if you think about it, we're slightly negative in track channels, but we're 2.8% organic from the consumer domestic division. And we said that that entire delta can be really explained by two things, about 300 basis points in total, about half in club and about half in the online channels. So, I would say that trend's probably going to continue. It's not going to get better over time, so that disconnect is going to be there.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, why isn't it like going into the first quarter, do you know what I mean because those trends, it seems like the club stuff is distribution more than growth, yeah, or is it growth have been club \u2013 do you know what I'm saying, like obviously, the e-commerce piece also should continue to grow. But I know that comp's a lot harder in the first quarter, but you'd think those trends would...","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think you hit it on the head, Bill. I think if anything, that the comp is overwhelming any trends that we're going to see in Q1, right. To be comping a 5% organic or 6% even household business growth in Q1 is going to be very difficult. But, so with all that said, we're going to have better growth than is in track channels, but the comp in Q1 just is very high, so our outlook is 1% to 2% Q1.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then what percentage of sales is e-commerce now?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","We've just said in the past, we're right in line with the 1% to 3%. So it's growing very quickly.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","But that's probably the....","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. We're right in the middle, around 2%.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And do you have big...","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, hey.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What's that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","We have a field of people.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm sorry.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","You're on number four. Let's get the other Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Just on the laundry section, can you maybe, now over four or five months since the Henkel-Sun merger. Kind of thoughts of is this going to be good for the category in 2017, do you think it's good for the category in the long run, do you not have an idea at this point?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. That's a crystal ball question. So it's fair to say that when a large company buys another pretty good-sized company, a lot of their plans are already in place. So whatever Sun had in place for Q3, Q4, maybe even for 2017 is already in place.","So, we don't really know \u2013 there's no evidence that says there's some obvious change in tactics because it's been going on for a few months. So here, we have to wait and see. There's one camp that says okay, you book, you get very promotional. The other camp would say, hey, people are going to be rational and it will be great for the category. So, we need a few quarters to figure that out and I'm sure it's going to be a question from everybody in Q1 and Q2, what's going on in the laundry. But as Rick points out, the comps, back to Bill's question, we have a 1% to 2% number in Q1 because our biggest quarter last year, we posted over a 5% organic number last year Q1, so that's a tough one to comp.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And just related to that, I mean, I didn't \u2013 I may have missed the thoughts of how you turnaround XTRA, that didn't seem to like there's any innovation, it's a price value-type position and that seems to be the one that's probably hit most by Sun. Are you optimistic you can turnaround this year and how do we do that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah \u2013 no, you're absolutely right. So, XTRA has lost share for three years in a row. As I pointed out, in 2016 XTRA grew our profit, so, and we haven't spent. So if you look at what we spent on a full-year basis for XTRA, we're around 37%, 38% sold on deal where it was simply tied and Sun 40% plus. So the question is, okay, you got to get into the game now to try to offset that because it's not indeed value, it's not really an innovation story, it's more of a price story.","Yeah, Kevin. Only Kevin that we have.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Two questions if I may. So, Matt, can you comment on balancing a bit the market share performance, you guys lost market share in six of your largest 10 brands.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","In measured channels.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","I'm sorry \u2013 in measured channel, in measured channel. With the advertising marketing relatively flat, I know it's sort of consistent with your evergreen target. Does that lend itself, the market share dynamic, to the argument that maybe advertising marketing needs to step up a bit to stem some of these losses, if not gain share and then I have a follow-up question.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, I'm going to give you a couple of opening remarks and then I'm going to ask our CMO to comment. I'm may say what she's going to say. So, marketing is 12%-plus of your revenue, so it's a pot, you have to decide how you're going to deploy it. So you're going to move things around from one brand to the other. Now, some brands have tremendous equity and they can withstand having less spend on them in a given year and then you move the chips over to another brand. So, we will have to deploy it smartly so that we're going to get the right effect. And some of that measured channel versus unmeasured channel stuff we're pretty relaxed about, because we know, we see the numbers and everybody can't see it. It's going to create greater unease going forward, I think, if you're an investor and analyst to try to see what's going on in unmeasured channels, but I'll let Britta comment on that.","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Sure, sir. Just building on what Matt said, I think we have different reactions in different categories of advertising, so what you will see, Slide is very obvious, great innovation, you can see it, so advertising will drive a change very quickly, whereas other categories where advertising is constant, you can't see that change as quickly.","I think we're very confident that the advertising we have or the communication we have is driving different categories. Then if you look at the overall, there's many, how would I say, noise overlaying it. We talked about laundry and the promotional effect overlaying the noise or we talked about TROJAN, that shift in channels is actually overlaying the true brand performance. So we look at it holistically across all the channels we have.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","A follow-up, Kevin. Another one?","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","I'm sorry?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Another one.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Sorry, Matt. Just a follow-up as, just to stick with online for a second, maybe talk a little bit about some of the opportunities, and maybe some of the risks you've seen in other categories whether it's \u2013 like blades, wet shave, some personal care categories like beauty where sort of have been demonstrated that the barriers to entry are a bit lower and there's been some risk to the incumbents. So, talk about how you guys are sort of looking at that. Britta, if you could chime in too particularly like in contraceptives as an example, to some of these categories that lend themselves a bit more to online? Thanks.","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Sure. So I would say categories are very, very different, so lower barriers to entry in beauty for example and cosmetics, yeah, or in skin care, if you look at our categories like condoms needs trust, yes, so we've seen across the world plenty of small condom pop-ups, right. None of them has stuck really anywhere in the world, because this is a category where long-term trust in the brand is absolutely essential.","Other categories I would talk about, it's a huge opportunity for us actually online because there are categories where you don't really feel comfortable if you go in the store and purchase them. So, we have a brand, for example, Replens\/RepHresh, yeah. You don't really want to be seen with a basket and saying I have personal odor. So, these categories were doing extremely well online, so I think the hard one is you have to differentiate on online very closely, think about what the consumer wants and what they're looking for. So, I personally see it as a huge opportunity for us. I'm not really worried. I don't see it as a threat or disruptive.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Joe?","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. First question I guess in terms of this move from tracked and non-tracked channels, what's the margin delta between your businesses in those two different channels. And then, secondly, on the acquisitions, it looks like you're paying roughly 4 times trailing revenue, call it 14 times EBITDA. For businesses that are in smaller categories, what's the goal there, is it geographic expansion for those two acquisitions you announced this morning?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. So, when we look at online contribution versus bricks-and-mortar contribution, we're looking at the basket, because some are actually going to have better margins online, some are going to have worse. But in total portfolio, they're about equivalent. We're not seeing an erosion from our online business. Your other question was on multiples?","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. It looks like you paid a pretty hefty multiple for some of these acquisitions, I'm curious what the growth opportunity is.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes, so we spent $290 million on those two. I'd tell you, what we paid was a little sub-12 and we think synergies is sub-10. So we think it's still a great deal whether it's international, domestic, wherever it would be. And I think \u2013 by the way, we also get some more scale for some key countries internationally, but I'd say it met all of our financial criteria.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Jason?","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. So, I have two questions. One, just on international. Obviously, years ago really didn't get that much of a discussion, now we talk a little bit more about it. So you're talking about some of the investments you're making there, maybe just to dovetail on Joe's question just about the acquisitions there, how should we be thinking, what percentage of sales if you think 5 years, 10 years down the road, will international be part of the story?","And then the second question, I guess, so really wanted to talk about the gross margin guidance and the promotional and the commodity, maybe if you can flesh that out a little bit. The comfort level that you have in case the promotional environment does get worse, 60 basis points does seem a lot for a CPG company just in this environment. So I'm just, I know you lean on the productivity, but can you just maybe put a little more color behind that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, well. We have the good fortune of having the head of our international business with this here today, so I'm going to let Steve take a swing at your question.","Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you. So at Church & Dwight, we really haven't focused that intently in international expansion. Several years ago when Matt asked me to come in, I really viewed international as a wonderful opportunity to be a growth engine, just another piece of our growth strategy long-term. So we do feel that international represents a significant growth opportunity for us, we're making investments and Matt alluded to two new sales and marketing offices that we just opened this year, one in Panama to service Latin America and one in Singapore to service Southeast Asia, both of which are very dramatic growth opportunities for the company. So, we'll continue to make acquisitions and investments in terms of driving growth behind the brands that we exist both domestically and internationally. So, we see this continue to play out as a source of growth, incremental growth for the company. Where do we see it going long-term, you want my answer or Matt's answer? But I would say that we would \u2013 we think that as you look at CPG across the world that we would see this playing out to be a much more significant part of our overall portfolio than it has in the past.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. So where we have that earlier slide on international, they remember me saying that we're doing what a lot of the CPG companies did decades ago. During the last couple of years, we said, hey, we have to get after international. We have really good brands. We have some brands that can travel. Not all, but some can and Steve and his squad were doing a great job. But we're going to have above average, so just think about our model, 3% organic growth, above-average organic growth from international for years to come. That's going to help us, total company.","And the ambition, we're a $500 million business today. What's our ambition? Our ambition is to be a $1 billion business. Will I be in a nursing home when that happens, maybe not, but that's not \u2013 that's organic and acquisitions, right. So, we've done acquisitions in the past. We did BATISTE a few years ago in 2011, listed these J&J brands and we're always on the hunt for other brands, but we're not slaves to our numbers. I'm not going to say, hey, we want to be $1 billion by this year. Not going to happen, but we do have high expectations of the business.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And then on the gross margin question, right. I'll just reiterate what I said. So, we're getting 40 basis points from acquisitions, great. It's been offset by commodities and promotional spending in FX and then we're getting the balance of it through litters in volume and productivity.","To your early estimate of that 40 basis points, are we comfortable with that 40 basis points? Well, I'm not going to break out the 40 basis points in any more detail. I'll just tell you that it assumes double-digit increases in our surfactants. It assumes a mid single-digit increase in our resin. So we have commodity inflation built-in, since 20%-plus increases on diesel, right. I mean, so we have expectations and if it's more than that then we'll do what we need to do to help offset that and whether it's productivity program stepping on that or whether it's SG&A, whatever it is, we always have a whole array of levers that we pull if things don't go as expected.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Caroline?","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. I have to follow tradition and ask two questions. Could you dive into the leaning on online margins because I thought it was really fascinating, most companies are up, they're saying they make more online?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","In some categories.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","But they, you start to wonder if you factor in all the investments in digital and the human resources you have to apply them in, I just want to understand a little bit more about that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. There's some truth in the fact that digital advertising is more efficient. We went through that example with litter. So instead of bombing away with TV advertising, you get to affect, to reach everybody. You're only going after the cat owners, so there are efficiencies in the advertising side, and \u2013 remember, that's going to be 12% of your sales.","So you can be more efficient there, if I'm just going to improve your margins. Heavy things don't travel well. So when you think about online, so heavy things like a laundry detergent, litter, those are categories where you're going to be more challenged to have the same margins as you have in store, but then if you have some personal care brands on the other side, you're going to make more money than you do in retail. It is a balance.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Right. So net-net, our online margins are at or above company average because of the personal care mix, right. So that's \u2013 we've said that the last few quarters and that's still the truth.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then the other one is just how do you get the operating leverage that you look for when you buy overseas because you just don't have the scale you have here, not that you're the biggest company here, but in a way opening the offices in Singapore, and so how do you also get margin expansion while you're doing that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","When you acquire a business, you mean? Well, when you acquire, the interesting thing about acquiring a business is you're buying marketing contribution. So essentially it's gross profit minus marketing. So we don't add a whole lot of SG&A when you're buying a business. So, right off the bat if you can get leverage on what you bought, you're going to improve the operating margins of the business, so. It's something that \u2013 all this SG&A doesn't come with it when we acquire a business.","So we have to acquire smart, so you have to buy where you have some infrastructure in different countries, particularly internationally. So that limits us a little bit more. It's hard for us to buy a business in a country we're not in and not bringing the SG&A. And then some of the math starts to fall down because we're oriented towards cash, how much cash the business throws off. I hope that helps you.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And the only thing is what Matt told you before, that small ANUSOL deal for example 80%, 90% of those volumes are going through Canada, we have sub Europe, right and Australia. So we feel like we do have a platform to leverage there. Those headquarters are really the jumping off point for regions, right. That's just a few SG&A heads and that's really the jumping off point for future expansion.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. How are you?","Unknown Speaker","Just sticking with international, I was still curious about the portfolio cohesiveness question, right. You talked about the financial attributes and I know that even domestically, right, the business has its chunks of businesses that don't necessarily have the most traditional strategic cohesion across the board and you've done wonderfully well with that. But you did it in one country, right? So to try to build an international business which is whatever it is, six or seven countries with a sort of feeling a little bit scattershot brand portfolio. I'm just curious if strategic fit is part of it beyond the financial attributes and the ability to leverage your infrastructure and so on? Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. That sounds like an indictment, so I think, Steve is ready for that beach ball.","Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Sure, not a problem. It's a great question. Many of these international subsidiaries, the countries that Matt puts on the chart were acquired, right. When we did other acquisitions, Carter-Wallace has been the primary one and it had some cats and dogs for sure. So, three years ago, what we decided to do is to make this an engine of growth. We had to have a strategy. Both what markets, what brands, what capabilities and where from an acquisition standpoint we would like to go. So, what we did is we identified key brands that we knew we could grow in international markets, right? That's one.","Two is, we have a North America focus, so we take the capabilities that the U.S. has and we extend them north, Canada, south into Mexico, so you saw Mexico, fabulous performance. We expect that to continue to grow, the biggest brand growing the fastest is our ARM & HAMMER franchise, so we feel like we have a long runway and we can continue to extend that further south through Latin America and the new sales and marketing offices will be a jumping-off point for that.","Around the world is mostly a personal care business, so it's our personal care brands that we've been able to really ignite in many parts around the world. BATISTE, fast-growing in every market that we launched in, right. STERIMAR, so we sell STERIMAR in 87 countries around the world. It's a unique phenomena that doesn't really exist in the United States, it's this concept of nasal hygiene. So we look at countries like China as a great opportunity to leverage our capability, all the clinicals that we do in this space into emerging markets and they've really taken hold.","So, one of our most successful markets for STERIMAR is in Mexico City for those same reasons. So we're exporting that same technology, talent, and capability in markets where we believe we have a right to compete and win. Femfresh is another category that is growing quite nicely for us.","So we really selected down for international markets, key brands that we know where we have a competitive advantage and a right to win and then we're deploying our capabilities in markets, so then we select countries that we want to win in and that's been the magic of success, really driving significant growth.","Last year, we did over 8% organic growth. This year, we're doing 10%, really based on that very strategic model.","Unknown Speaker","That's great. That's really helpful. Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Olivia?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. First question on laundry, we didn't really talk a lot about liquid laundry detergent, it's been a while since we've seen something in terms of innovation there and it's still a much larger category than unit dose despite the growth there. So I was just wondering if you can give it a little bit more color on that? And then back to international, clearly the growth has been phenomenal there, but for 2017, you're looking for growth about half the level what you achieved in 2016. So can you sort of bridge that gap a little bit, realizing that of course it's tough to expect double-digit growth in perpetuity? Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. The liquid laundry category, you're right. There isn't a lot of innovation in liquid laundry, so it's more of a brand story and brand equity, so all the growth has been driven by unit dose over time. I think that's going to continue in the future, so it's \u2013 no expectation, there was an expectation actually at one point there'll be further compaction in liquid laundry that clearly is not obvious today. Once upon a time, it was believed in 2017, liquid laundry will be compacted again because Wal-Mart announced that years ago. That is not on the radar screen right now.","So, with respect to liquid laundry, it's more of a brand story. I'll ask Britta or Lou, if they want to add anything on liquid laundry detergent? You want to add to that?","Louis H. Tursi - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","The only thing that I would add to that would be that over the years, we have launched a lot in laundry detergent, and some of those sub-segments have done better than others. And so, there's distribution opportunities on some of those that we still haven't capitalized on, as we launched a different flavor or in the free category sensitive, that's what I mean, so we have opportunity in the sensitive category as an example. So, we are looking to expand our distribution in some of the great items that we've launched in the past that haven't capitalized on all the distribution opportunities.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, what's the second question you had, that was a two-parter?","Louis H. Tursi - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I would love to commit to 10% or double-digit growth from here into infinity. But I think what we see is some of our core markets, like developed markets in Europe which had a fabulous year last year, we don't expect that to continue long-term, we expect that to moderate to kind of the company average growth. Last year, they really over-delivered.","Same thing with Canada with a great performance last year, we don't expect that long-term to continue. But we do expect the 4% to 5% at a minimum. We have higher expectations for ourselves in international markets, but I think we do see developed markets slowing down from their high point last year.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Steve?","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","I'm actually going to build on both of those questions. On the laundry side, your main competitors are \u2013 speaking of branding and marketing, are branding a lot right now, right. Both of them in the Super Bowl with various properties. So it sounds like you're going to go to market in liquid with basically your current portfolio, is that a big area of focus for stepped-up marketing next year or \u2013 is \u2013 what's the strategy in liquid as your competitors do a lot?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. There's no way we would \u2013 we'd go through our laundry strategy today for 2017. Is that what you're asking?","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","So, I guess, yes. There's no real incremental news that you're....","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Maybe I can help.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah.","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Maybe I can help a little bit. So, first of all, Super Bowl, I think \u2013 I want to be very clear, I think it's a great PR for most of them, but value. We are value-driven. We are very clear now on our metrics where we invest, and where we don't invest. So I think that's my number one to say about Super Bowl ads, right. We all enjoy watching them, but if you think about it you want to reach consumers at affordable cost, they're not the greatest.","Secondly, I want to say, laundry, I mean, strip out a little bit of the noise, how much innovation has really been in liquid laundry over the last couple of years. You get a new flavor and a new flavor gets promoted and then it drops off again. And that's true for many of our competitors and I think we're making a decision to be much more clear that this is the area where consumers are not looking for something new every single time. They want good great performing products at a great value and that's what we are driving, what we have been driving. And just to come back to our shares, I think that's the secret formula of ARM & HAMMER and we've proven even in 2016 with all that kind of laundry battle going on, that ARM & HAMMER was a big winner. So, I think that's just to put it in context and distract a little bit of the noise around.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Fair enough. And then on international, just trying to get a sense of it sounds like, it feels like it's an increased priority. When it comes to M&A, is the financial bar higher or lower internationally versus domestic?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. it's not lower. The financial bar is universal, whether it's international or domestic and the businesses we just bought have cleared those hurdles.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","So, there's no relaxation on our standards.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Jason?","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for the question and congratulations again on a strong finish to the year. A couple of quick questions. First, kind of housekeeping on the stock options accounting change. If you look at your 10-K filing for last year, it would have been around a $0.14 benefit, the year before $0.06, the year before $0.07, why only $0.03 benefit as we look into next year and I guess what I'm getting is, is there a degree of conservatism embedded in that?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'd probably answer that a couple of different ways. So, quantitatively, you're right. It's a bigger benefit if you take 2016, our math has a dime, $0.10 if it was 2016. If you take the five-year average, it's a nickel. If we take Q4, annualize it, zero, right? So, it all depends on how the stock price moves and it's kind of a circular relationship. So, you can't have a low target price and high expectations stock option exercises, right? It just doesn't work in the modeling. So, that's on the stock option exercises.","So net-net, $0.03, about $1.8 million of stock option exercises is our expectation. That could change, right? And we've seen our peer group, a lot of volatility, you guys see it even more than I do, right, people have raised and lowered multiple times already on this new accounting standard and so we're trying to take the noise out of it and if \u2013 hey, if it's worth it we're going to \u2013 we'll raise the number, we're going to be really clear about it.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate the visibility. Let's talk \u2013 go back to a question where we don't have the visibility and that's back to the unmeasured channel performance. It's hard, it's difficult since we can't see it, feel it, touch it and we're used to seeing, feeling and touching the performance. It's also hard because if we look at your performance and we compare it to what we can see, the spread, the delta is quite volatile.","We have a really wide gap this quarter, a pretty narrow gap the quarter before. Implicitly you're guiding to a fairly narrow gap in the next quarter. I guess, we'll see how consumption comes out but what we've seen so far suggests a pretty narrow gap. Can you give us a little more color in terms of what drives the volatility quarter-to-quarter, why that isn't sort of a steadier state magnitude of relative outperformance? And maybe if there were some real lumpy volatility from last year, you can give us some color just so we hopefully can anticipate it coming?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, some of it can be distribution, the timing of distribution from year-over-year. Let's say you're right about online, it should be pretty steady if you have X sales online in one quarter it should be that or more in the next quarter. But, yeah, I think there's definitely going to be some distribution and portfolio mix year-over-year, but it's something we struggle with too, it's hard to forecast actually.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I would say the same thing, it's a little lumpy for us too, so we tried to give you guys the best all-in algorithm that we can and sometimes we are under and sometimes we are over, but visibility is still tough.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","There's something else you should be aware of too, you can be online on, say, Amazon with plenty of products this month and next month, you're not. So you can get in and out because of their algorithms and how much you're selling online, et cetera, and that does create some wide fluctuations within a quarter and sometimes quarter-to-quarter. I'm sure you've heard that.","Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Maybe I can help with one little one. So how many of you took a New Year's resolution? We had a big campaign, New Year, New Me on vitamins, which is, we are the number one brand on Amazon online. So these kinds of effects and how successful one of these campaigns is going to be as we are all learning about online is hard to predict. So I would say that's also to invisible parts, these accelerating factors, which is certain categories perform well, certain timing of the year perform well. So that's for example, why the gap in Q4 where we shipped for that New Year, New Me was already, not visible to you guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Right here.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks. I have a general question on pricing and your ability and willingness to pull the pricing lever in 2017 especially given the heightened competitive environment. That would be first. And then second, your price mix internationally during the quarter deteriorated sequentially. So if you could touch on that as well as in terms of your ability to do it internationally, thinking about rising or increasing FX headwinds?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","When you say the price lever in 2017, you're saying our ability to raise price? Yeah. Okay, well, as far as raising prices goes, typically the categories you may be able to do that are categories where you're most dominant. So, say, baking soda, you have a 75%-plus share. Condoms, you have a 75%-plus share.","But if you don't have that kind of leverage it's more difficult, number one. Number two is you need to have the support of the commodity cost rising. So, there are a lot of retailers, we will be able to pull the lever if you can support it with input costs which of course we have, but it remains to be seen if we can pass that on in 2017. A lot of retailers are very reluctant to take price as you probably know. What's your second part of your question?","Unknown Speaker","Just the same concept internationally, because in the fourth quarter price mix deteriorated sequentially, so just thinking about it internationally as well as you think about your mix?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","If anything it's probably just mix rather than in terms of country, right. If Canada's doing better, it's more of a household-type product, that's probably more than anything. I wouldn't read into it.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Anybody else before we wrap it up here?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks you all for coming today. Thanks for joining online, as I said super fourth quarter and optimistic about 2017. Thank you."],"4612":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February  5, 2013 12:30 PM ET","Executives","James Craigie - Chairman and CEO","Matthew T. Farrell - EVP & CFO","Analysts","","[Call Starts Abruptly]","","This was what this floor is made for in a refreshner economy, which we have been in from about 2008, this was the case of the laundry category, more and more users are shifting from the premium mid-tier price points for the Value and Extreme Value price points. In fact as of little past year or so, the Value category is now growing bigger than the mid price category, which you can see on this chart and encroaching up on the premium category soon.","In fact more households, you look at actual households, more households use a Value detergent than a mid or premium price detergent and its growing, and we\u2019ve got share results. As you can see we have just steadily every year gained a point or two of the total fair of the total laundry category. We are now almost 15%. As you will see Church & Dwight has grown over the last three years, we\u2019ve gained 300 share points, everybody else has lost and now we\u2019ve past Sun as the number two company in America on pure dollar share basis.","If you look at the Value segment, we are by far the biggest player in the Value segment, over 50% of the segment; we\u2019ve gained eight share points within the Value players. We are now bigger than the number two, three and four players combined. You can look at the total Washload. This is what people actually use in their household. How many Washloads are our products versus other products, they give us some liquid dollars because those are just purely what they use in the Washload, you can see we have increased the number of Washloads in the American household between 2009 and 2012 and we are far closer to Procter on total Washloads than we are of a dollar basis and growing.","Every player well in 2013 will expect continued strong growth of our laundry business plans of 2013. First of all we have achieved some major distribution gains on our two products across major North American accounts. So we\u2019re going to be growing the shelf across all these accounts. Now, I know some of you are workshop analysts will ask me questions as to which accounts and the answer is we\u2019re not going to tell you. For competitive reasons we\u2019re not going to name those things these things are happening as we speak by the way this is the pitch of the three analysts will have a hold on our stock anyway.","There are no details you\u2019re going to ask me 100 times and you could tell you accounts what timing whatever. I would simply tell, I still try a little around on distribution across all of our products within 2009, 2012. I will simply tell you in 2013 in our laundry business we probably have the biggest amount of distribution gains than we've ever had in our business and by the way we deserve this because of our share growth the distribution have to keep catching up with our share gains and this is not as we've got something we deserve we totally deserve this because we grew our share of net products, so I showed you so much.","And we have some great new products coming around next year for both ARM & HAMMER and Xtra that will help drive increase sales along with that increased distribution. And Xtra, this is a brand that provides great value to consumer. This brand is about a third of the price of the premium brands. We put a dimension on how big Xtra is?","Xtra share is \u2013 got a highest cubic share ever in the fourth quarter of 6.4, how big is that? Some you may not know this. That is bigger than P&G\u2019s Era and Sheer combined. That\u2019s bigger than West House Son and Width combined. So Xtra is a big brand and we\u2019re launching two great new fragrances on this in 2013. This brand is very much driven by its fragrance and deo and so we are launching two great new fragrances to help drive this brand.","Big news today folks. This is ARM & HAMMER ultra power, we\u2019re leading the way in the liquid laundry category on concentration. This is a win for everybody out there. The consumer wins in this case because we\u2019re improving value we\u2019re offering 20% more lows along with the downsized version here with less water in it, improving performance, this product is 50% whiter and 50% fresher. As a product the smaller bottle which you get a compaction is easier for handling and storage. That is environment friendly because its less weight. And the consumer to control the dosage and I\u2019ll talk about that in a second.","The retail wings on this one the bottles are small they can ship more per truck so they save lots of money on their transportation cost. They can fit more bottles on the shelves. So see you a lot of stock and higher and one of the best fit and drives category growth. And we are watching the product incrementally to our base business today and only will walk into retail seeking incrementally \u2013 we just result them. There sponsor has been extremely positive.","Why are we doing the next around of compaction from you would say because it is a little bit of risky going from bigger bottles to smaller bottles this is why we\u2019re doing it. If you look at the last amount of compaction which has happened over 2006 to 2007 as a world out across the country and then you look at it in the 12 month after it was fully out there going into 2008, 2009 compactions rolled a 5% gain in the total laundry category, big improvement, which I think fully liquid laundry category, everything right in the first place leave my own side that was big that\u2019s big growth.","","You might say well isn\u2019t positive during that or something we call unit dose. The answer is absolutely not. Consumers use less laundry detergents when they switch from liquid or powder to unit dose. You can see on this chart that as unit dose sales versus the total category, this was reported by Nielsen, all channels which captures 90% of retail consumption out there for all manufacturers involved with it. Unit dose has grown, since it started the numbers versus year ago, you can see growth of $22 million over a year ago to $140 million.","But you can see down for the laundry category, which is liquid, powder and unit dose, all three forms, incremental in Q1, but in Q2 as the biggest player, I know this category has started pushing unit dose. You can see the total detergent category has lost more and more and more sales. Unit dose is hurting the laundry detergent category. Compaction will help the laundry detergent categories, we last did it and that\u2019s by we are leading the effort and hopefully the other manufacturers will get the news and follow us. I was very pleased to hear yesterday Clorox doing around a compaction in bleaches. Smart move for all the same reasons we are doing it.","All right so we are on the (NYSE:TV) product portfolio, part premium, part value, which is really helping to drive great sales in especially recessionary time, but also great times too. Number two we know how to build our powder brand share. I\u2019ll talk about we have eight powder brands as you can see in this charts. Those eight powder brands represent 80% of our sales and profits. Those were the eight powder brands there, the number one in every category or a major product and leading households like ARM & HAMMER, which connects about many categories.","(Inaudible), we think there is no secret to this, this should be every brand in America, but we have very innovative products that I would tell you I think our innovation pipeline is as good or better than any other CPG company out there. We\u2019ve increased our marketing spending, we\u2019ve increased our distribution in to those three things and you build your share on your brands.","Let me talk about new product series. The major news today coming across, I think first of all the major new products on our existing platforms today, in a second I will talk about some wide space categories, and the joining categories. These are some of our new products, I talked a minute ago about XTRA, just repeating that slide. I talked a minute ago about Ultra Power, big new news leading the way out there and the next one is compaction.","Let\u2019s move to Cat Litter, Cat Litter we had massive new launch to XTRA called Ultra Last, it\u2019s the number one new Cat Litter launch since 2005 and this year we are going to grow it even further by launching a larger size expansion to 2013. Pure Ecstasy and TROJAN, this is the next new form of TROJAN going out there. We\u2019ve had a great success line. I will show you more in a second on that. It is a revolutionary new patented design that makes you feel like nothing is there and it\u2019s an Ultrasmooth lubricant going with it.","Nair Spa Clay Trio, wash and launch Nair Spa Clay product individual product, this we are combining them into a package called Trio, so you get in one little package how to prepare your skin, how to remove the hair and how to moisturize the skin all at once.","Now to White Space, turning over to big White Space categories we are going into which we think will help drive very significant growth for our company. These categories are big, manual toothbrush $800 million category, Cold Sore $200 million category dishwashing additives 140, Sexual lubricants $250 million category.","Last year we launched late last year Tooth Tunes proprietary technology we actually acquired from the Hasbro Company. This product we launched in the second half of the year. This product is doing awesome already achieved a 16% share of kids battery toothbrushes. In this case, proprietary technology only we can do and I\u2019ve always said jokingly but true if we had children we yell at all the time to brush their teeth at night you have to yell it from stop brushing their teeth when they have Tooth Tunes and the music is playing in their head.","Big new news here folks we have the exclusive bright news for our musical toothbrush form the One Direction brand now the old timer is going to say who the heck is One Direction, for those of you have young kids they\u2019re going to say oh my god One Direction this is the hottest boys brand in the world. They sold over 23 million singles albums and DVDs last year they were named Billboard MTV\u2019s Top Artist for 2012 their world tour for 2013 is already been sold out and they got a movie coming out in August of this year. This is as hot as it gets and we\u2019re launching two brushes with two of them are the favorite songs on them (inaudible) those are you going home tonight with especially young girls in the family are going to be very curious when you bring this product home tonight its shipping as we speak and your kids will be the first once in America to have this product.","Cold Sore, Matt mentioned we had some issues on the oil gel \u2013 private label, we\u2019re dealing with that on the core business. Last year we launched a new product called Cold Sore treatment. Again it\u2019s a some patent technology this product is incredible it\u2019s always in the top 10 SKUs in the Cold Sore category. I tell if you have friends have some cold sore tell them to use this product. The competitive product that\u2019s been out there has \u2013 users over seven straight days and it only stops healing by about six or seven hours. This product is one application healing stuffs immediately its incredible I swear to you tell your friends about Cold Sore, given this product they will thank you.","Dishwashing additives another thing we started last year, we\u2019re going to span out this year our Oxiclean Dishwashing Booster with the number one new product in the dishwashing additives category. Again we launched it late last year. As I told to you straight back then dishwashing products, they get phosphate out of the product last year but the government phosphates and great cheap cleaners that help make your glasses sparkle they had to take it out they haven\u2019t quite found replacements for that. We've launched this product to help you store the cleaning power of dishwashing products. It is DD additives category since we was launched 58% of the growth was due to our product, we've achieved a 10% market share in year one. And we\u2019re spending on that in a year or two by launching a larger size of not even value of consumers.","Huge news, our company which is the owner of TROJAN brand the number one sex brand in America is launching a line of lubricants next year. The lines that we call TROJAN Crazy Sexy Feel. We\u2019re going to do a (mimine) to this category with the X brand end of the ordering category.","There is going to be great excitement in this category which it needs. And we have a huge competitive advantage we\u2019re going to be launching samples of this in the millions and millions of boxes of condoms that we fill so we\u2019re going to be putting again wait it to the hands of people out there to enjoy.","You can see lubricant category is very attractive on a totally North American basis you can see condoms is about $500 million basis lubricants about half that size. The category is actually kind of stop to declining because of the lack of the news and we\u2019re going to fix that and the margin of this business are very high. Why the people use lubricants, its not a myth out there, which need to dispelled. A lot of people believe lubricants are just used for older women they\u2019re just for only to fix the problem that\u2019s not true. We've done extensive studies with major universities out there and found out lubrications are critical components and great effect our lubricants are used mainly for pleasure, fun and comfort and lubricants use fulfills want the needs of across a wide range of users and situations.","You know folks that\u2019s the mainstream acceptance in this country, the Fifty Shades of Grey book is the moving seller for the past two weeks, the movie is coming out in 2014. So we want to take TROJAN and make it our next great mega brand in this country after the ARM & HAMMER mega brand. We want to become the leading brand in three major sexual health segments, we already own a 66) share of the common business in North America we want the become a leading premium brand n the vibration market in North America and want to become the leading premium brand in the $250 million lubricant market.","You can we (inaudible) uncommon through great innovations that we launched over last few years and achieve sheer growth again this is across from three countries and doing extremely well. Lubricants and vibrators have to understand are helping to extend our franchise as this chapter shows that\u2019s age of consumers on the bottom the show for condoms \u2013 use of condoms declines over age. Youths and vibes don\u2019t. they stay very high usage in overall age group. So this is really going to bring great growth and strength for the TROJAN business force for launching in these businesses. We combine through seconds, interesting fact about just make you very popular your next cocktail party your neighborhood.","There are two types more people use vibrator, 30% use condoms, 53% of adult women and 46% of adult men have used the vibrator sometime in their life. So that we say when an adult women and men have used it with their partner that will surprise you and get this one 56% of women and 59% of men who have never used a vibrator before believe that a vibrator use is a healthy part of a women\u2019s sex life where as people have used (inaudible) 95% believe that so this category has a lot of outside opportunity.","We've now with a full line of vibrators on the marketplace and last year we did am interesting little test, we decided to give away vibrators in New York City to find out how much people appeal to it improves the reach out in America that everybody wants vibrators. On the first day we did in August 9, we launched in New York City and we have hires that announced it and we have people lined up over five blocks more and waiting for a free vibrator to the point where Bloomberg said its folks that didn\u2019t us down in front page of New York Post the next day (inaudible). Well, next day we got the license to come back out and do it from the city we did down on the meat packing district we\u2019re not stupid.","","And you can see the lines again, lining up before that and the people loving it, we give away almost 10,000 free vibrators and it was extremely popular. We since rolled that out last year to Chicago and Boston, had equally incredible results. This year we are going to roll up 15 more cities and drive extended retail distribution, there is the picture down there in Washington, in front of the Washington monument; again we are very careful how we choose our sites show the symbolism behind them and have great success. So if you want to actually put it to do we will give you the cities and the timeframe, so you can meet all your friends across the world and fun out there.","So that\u2019s good in price, I think it again it probably the most innovative new pipeline of products that we ever had in our history entering some major new categories with exciting news. We support those increased marketing, interesting chart, we\u2019ve never quite shown this kind of detail before. This is a chart of our total marketing spending and very carefully here this is advertising, consumer and trade dollars. We are not going to give you the details, but I am just going to show you a few additives up across the years, you can see that our spending across, out the most total three elements of what we call marketing has gone to 9% CAGR across the year. So we have been increasing our support by on great innovations.","You take those two, you will grow up in sales, grow up to the retail world and you tell them, hey, we need more distribution, and we get it. This is a fascinating chart that compares between 2009 whatever we had in this brand, how does it compare that\u2019s a 100, how to compare certainly well in 2012 and you can see just from that timeframe, which goes through the end of last year we had major gains across our brands and I would tell you in 2013 or probably the biggest year this division gained across our entire franchise out there. So when I come back here next year I will show you the 2013 results, but I can tell you right now based on what we know from what a counsel said to us in a very (inaudible) to do its going to be a terrific year in 2013.","Yet all together and after the great growth in our power brands, this is the last five years our eight power brands have grown share over 75% of the time, heck of a lot more of the other companies out there who are trying to get to 50%. We\u2019ve gone to 75% December time, again had a great year in 2012 with six of the eight growing and actually I explained to you Nair had a great year, but there was a new entry that grew the category even more than we grew, so tactically our share went down, but our sales were right here.","This (inaudible) chart say well, this just shows you how we are not just one year wonders, we do it consistently. Here is share growth in ARM & HAMMER (Toothpaste) shows us 16% CAGR between 2003 and 2012. Here is ARM & HAMMER Litter, a category we entered in 1998 and had a 14% CAGR and sales force driven by tremendous innovations over that time period.","OxiClean, a great brand and I will talk a bit more in a second. If you look at this brand, we bought it in 2006, but where it is today take those combined sales of the Oxi product itself and we what we co-branded with, this product is going up to 22% CAGR and we tripled the total sales of this business since we bought it 2006.","First Response, I love this brand. We acquired this brand in 2001; it is a (mute) number three brand with a 12 share. Now about 11 years later we are the number one player in the marketplace with over 30 share and still growing.","The bottom line we had a great year in 2012 and we exited with great momentum, on the year, six of eight power brands grew to record levels, didn\u2019t just grow record all time levels on an annual basis and in the fourth quarter of 2012 seven of the eight grew share in the fourth quarter and those quarterly shares and half of them, a record quarterly share, so, very important to us as we exit the year with very strong momentum.","Now well great portfolio, great power brands driven by innovation and marketing, distribution, but sometimes people say we got little Church & Dwight, you are only $3 billion in sales up against guidance, they get to $8 billion in sales, how do you defend yourself when you got a task? Let me show you. I have told this story before, the ending is even better than I told you before. This is the story of OxiClean. We bought this business in 2006 with a 27 share, which was the number one brand at the time. In the next three years through 2009 we grew it to 40.7 share, how we do that, like I just told you, create new products, increase the advertising significantly, but then in 2009 the player in the marketplace decided they are one of the biggest share of this business.","They already had a little stain pen out there, that was a sub 10% share of the category, but they decided to come on board with also the ones that come out as hard. We didn\u2019t sit there, we ferociously defend the business, we launched a whole line of new products, we also cobranded the product, because other products being more awareness of the OxiClean name, we increased advertising spending to make it the number two most advertised product in the entire fabric care category and the end result was that now today, our share in 2012 is actually higher than it was in 2009 when the other guy entered the category and you can see on their line, the second line down there that their share at one point reaches high as 17% to 18% of the category. They have backed down to13% of the category and are barely above where they started the business in 2009. And you can see we totally deflected all the share gain to other players in that category, so not only we are still number one, but we are growing.","International, international is about 18% of our portfolio, not as much as (inaudible) but a very good piece of our portfolio. Our business is concentrated in six countries, where we have $500 million in sales, five of those six countries are doing very well. Over the five year time periods of 2012 we had good strong sales growth across those countries and even the one we are often really down about 1%.","Drivers of that is not only do we have our power brand corporately in some of those countries, but we also have some very strong international power brands between RUB A535 which is the hot, icy hot brand of Canada, we have Grava, number one upset stomach brand affairs, (Therma) which is big, which is the international version of simply failing we have here, so we have some very strong power brands, number one and two in their categories out there, mostly personal care, mostly high margin and we have our corporate power, we\u2019ve been expanding ARM & HAMMER Laundry to Canada and Mexico, Cat Litter the same, we have extended toothpaste around the world and we grow out Spinbrush around different countries.","We are also acquiring some brand. We acquired the Batiste business last year in the UK for dry shampoo, doing exceptionally well, it\u2019s a fixed share in the UK, you heard so much, we are the leading wet shampoo business the dry shampoo the leading wet shampoo business only 12 this business has grown from a four to six share in last 12 months and really a hot product and we have a process expanding this around the world. And last but not least we\u2019re leveraging our one company strength in across all functions around the world both to drive innovation drive our marketing better and to drive all of our cost savings.","And we\u2019re proud expanding gross margin. We've told you many times in the past gross margin is the gas to our gas tank. We've had a fantastic record here between 2001 and 2012 we've increased our gross margin from 29% roughly to 44% or 1510 basis point increase.","As well talking about competition the last five years Church & Dwight has by far exceeded anybody\u2019s growth in gross margin last timeframe we\u2019re over 500 basis points over the last five years, the next closest guy is about 200 basis points.","The key drivers of that things we talked to about before what we keep doing them there is going to be very cost optimization program, good to greater, use of that famous book by Jim Collins, just our name -- it applies to what we call reformulation of products reducing packaging, reduce the number of SKUs and have got plans for more efficiently laundry compaction was a big contributor back about 2007, 2008 and hedging commodity do an excellent job of doing -- make sure we had consistent lower across the commodities.","Supply chain restructuring we've got lot of capital we\u2019re building some new plants out there to help our laundering capital businesses which are very heavy businesses so it makes it very different that our plans across the country we now have plans in the East Coast, Mid West and the West Coast the best solution chain of any laundry product out in America, so and diesel being as high as it is, the money on transportation cost they had three plants out here.","Acquisition synergies I\u2019ll talk about more in a second but we love the core high margin brands and drive a lot of out of cost out of them to make them ever more accretive to our business. And price mix, we have a principle in-house that everything we launch is new products we want the gross margin equal to or higher than the other products in the line that\u2019s launched.","I mentioned acquisition we have a great track record in acquisitions very clear guidelines we try to follow in every case so we primarily want number one or two share brand. I am firm believer that anything below that is a bread that\u2019s in trouble and with some possible turnaround so we want leading brands we want higher growth brands higher margin brands, we want to act that like that means we got to love to pick up headquarters and plan something like that we will have some competitive advantage. But we don\u2019t like to otherwise, we want to leverage our capital base in manufacturing logistics and purchasing and we want businesses we believe over the long-term with sustainable competitive advantages so we can grow their share and sales.","Here is our track record you can see a little past 12 years our businesses and I mentioned really Matt said it too, we have eight power brands seven of those eight brands we acquired that I was questioned earlier what is new Avid acquisition will be nice power brand and it is so Avid -- presentations going forward that\u2019s going to become our next power brand. We quickly integrate these acquisitions and quickly grow their shares you can see on all these acquisitions how much we have grown shares over time very solid consistent record .","Let me talk about Avid for one second those of you have heard it before this is the fantastic acquisition. This is the acquisition the very fast growing category called vitamins, mineral supplements. And we have the most unique and hottest product in that category by acquiring this company. And this is the business I mean vitamins, minerals supplements what a category I mean you know in our world today historically 3% to 4% growing category was good now most categories are growing 0% to 2%, decent business is going to steadily very single -- mid to high single digit growth rates and those growth rates are doing to continue as this increased focus on health and fitness in this country is the population ages above the mineral supplement categories continue very strong growth rates.","Interesting split here very big difference from kid\u2019s category to adult category. The kid\u2019s vitamin business is only about $200 million category adults are at least $3.3 billion category. Gummies in total make up over 58% of the kids business, they don\u2019t make up 3% of the adult business. So we\u2019re looking at adult being 16 times the size of the kid as a category and yet only 3% penetration of gummies and we believe there is tremendous upside there.","Avid little critter brand is always the number one brand in the kid\u2019s vitamin world, the Vitafusion brand which is the adult version is the number one brand, but again number one with only 3% of the total business. We do see how fast these are growing the Vitafusion the adult version on the left there because only launched in 2008 and its already through 2011 we have issued 2012 numbers that\u2019s the 2011 already close $100 million business. The kid\u2019s side again is the number one player there is already over $100 million business with tremendous growth rates.","This little place for strength I mean think about what we do well and what I talked about already. We ship a fragmented category that\u2019s why its opening for very strong agile competitor like Church & Dwight. We have a great track record I showed you of building the share. We have the resources this company did not have to take all their great product and their great marketing support and expand distribution.","We have great internal know-how that they didn\u2019t have and that\u2019s the systems and packaging line from we can apply to their plans and save a lot of money. We have economies of scale they don\u2019t have in purchasing logistics and this is a business somebody say well this is a regulated business well how we have a bunch of regulated businesses that we fully understand how to properly deal with the FDA going forward.","This is going to have a great impact in our share price going forward we just acquired this business officially in October 1 and paid $650 million for it over this year and we are set to realize $15 million in cost savings I would tell you that\u2019s right on track everything is going very well doing a great effort for my entire team and you can see down, we have talk about this few minutes \u2013 couple of minutes, we\u2019re calling 9% EPS growth on the core business in 2009 an additional 5% EPS growth will come from the Avid acquisition.","So that\u2019s our formula there a great core business great acquisitions, great continuity to see our results. And if you haven\u2019t tried it yet there is a sample in your goodie bag (inaudible) someone in the room here try them, I swear to you I was like most of you I had never had anything but hard pills for my vitamin, they brought this I got into it, I got in the gummies and I look forward every morning, get up in the morning and eating my gummies its just the best (strip) and we have the very best gummy in the market. I\u2019ve tried them all many times, other guys are not as soft and chewy, not as favorable, we have the best tasting gummy vitamin out there and you\u2019re going to be hearing a lot about that as we double the advertisement spending on this in 2013.","Getting more into the math territory right now, we have best-in-class free cash flow, we kind of talked about this. You saw the tremendous growth in the cash flow over the last five years. The blue lines here are through 2011 and we had latest information on competition. You can see we are best-in-class. Nobody has done as well as we did and we've done it again, the gold line in 2012 more than 118% free cash flow conversion.","Number eight something very unique by the company\u2019s superior overhead management control. Interesting chart our revenues have increased 93% since 2004. Our headcounts increased only 15%. Now I showed you this chart in the pad, our headcount actually have been going down through last year, but in the Avid acquisition we picked up about 750 employees. So actually prior to thinking of Avid our debt employee line would have gone 3800 in the past to 3600. So making that we would have increased sales 93% and actually reduced headcount and the same time taking our EPS up 260%, but even with Avid we\u2019re still best-in-class in the industry. Nobody has the revenue for employee that we do even picking up 730 employees.","And believe me folks we do walk a lot. We don\u2019t have a company trial, I wish I did. I don\u2019t have a company plan I wish I did. I don\u2019t have a golf club membership, I wish I did, but I have Church & Dwight stock, and I can buy all those things, my Church & Dwight stock because it\u2019s not as so much. In fact lot of that things in my Church & Dwight stock and if you wanted to you go afford all those things. And then say -- Okay, Jim, great results. How do you get them, how do you keep doing it? Well we put in a new health care plan in the second next year, they have to save money, you know we spend a lot of money on a information system, we\u2019ve got an SAP system. All that allowed us to go forward and keep our headcount down to continue to grow this business and it will help us as we keep lowering our percent of net revenue spend what we call SG&A.","My expert management team in the room here today, all my lovely experts, I tried it before, I do not believe in rotating people around. I do not believe at fine desk person he is training over in sales or marketing or vice versa, makes him a better person in the future to be Jim\u2019s replacement someday, I don\u2019t really train 50 people be my replacement someday, there is only one of me. In the mean time I want people to become experts in their functions and they are -- my age strategic business views leaders have been in their current jobs at least five years, they have an average of 23 years of experience in the industry that pays off, our eight power brands I showed you, have grown category growth 30 out of 40 times in the last five years.","We've been able to minimize headcounts because they don\u2019t need extra people to help, in fact they can reduce people because they know the business so well, that is also in the execution, everybody knows each other, they know what they doing they have been doing over three years, its great and then execution is one of the great hallmarks of Church & Dwight and we're able to absorb big one, big one, absorb acquisitions without adding out incremental headcount. My people actually beg me, they are kind of somewhat bored running the same business over again they say give me new brands, give me your businesses and we can bring out business out without adding lot of additional headcount s.","(Figures) one to nine we will end up with a fact that we are total shareholder returns junkies. We have had an incredible decade of growth, tripling sales, gross margins were up, marketing spending up, SG&A only up 220 basis points, leads to great results, you can read them at operating income, EPS, adjusted free cash flow and our marketing cap in my tenure has grown $2 billion to over $8 billion, huge increase.","And if you own our stock about ten years you have averaged 19.2% of the total shareholder return, which you have to make a lot of your investors out there and shareholders very happy.",".There is my team, that\u2019s actually done a year ago, February 7th to my point a second ago, there's my team. Every one of them is here today, who are in their very last year, I have been even with the same stupid tie I wore last year. Last year, I had a giants had on because the giants had just won the Super Bowl, I am not aware (inaudible) or good team, but anyway we are here about again today with all my great TSR junkies throughout this room. And folks we are 100% in the game, our bonuses are tied to 100% of business results, the business results mean the most you and all of your models out there, 25% of our bonus is now revenue, 25% of our bonus is in the gross margin expansion targets, 25% is sitting at our adjusted EPS target and 25% free cash flow.","Our equity compensation is 100% stock option, that\u2019s where you should want to hear. We are not going to get rewarded if the stock price doesn't go up. We don't have phantom stock or restrictive stock that grows in value for no improvement in stock price. We are 100% stock options. We are exactly in the same mindset you are, grow that stock price and we are required to be heavily invested. Over 80% of my net worth is in this \u2013 of this company\u2019s stock. But trust me I watched the results every day, we broke 60 this morning. Thank you.","Anyways with that I\u2019ll let Matt come back up here and tell you more about the outlook for 2013 and the numbers.","Matthew Farrell","Okay we are going to wrap it up now. So you know our long-term algorithm for organic sales growth is 3% to 4%, we are calling that again in 2013. As I said before we have three divisions, Domestic, International and Specialty products, so all three divisions we expect to be within that range.","Our gross margin, you should all think of 2013 as a reset year for us. So we just required a business that has lower than company average gross margins. So we have four quarters that I have baked into our numbers into 2013. But keep in mind as we said in our release that we expect our existing business, base business to expand its gross margin 25 to 50 basis points. One of the things too is we about 60% of our most volatile commodity hedged as of today, so it again increases our confidence and our ability to hit that number on a full year basis.","And then marketing, again, it's a kind of reset year for us and we\u2019ve got four quarters of the gummy vitamin business. As you know it had historically a lower spend as a percentage of sales. We said we are going to take that up at not as high as necessarily through our other businesses. And the thing we watch most closely is share voice versus share market. So we're very, very keen on what is been spend in a particular category and making sure that we are more than competitive with respect to our investment in our brands.","And then finally EPS, so you can see we are expecting 14% EPS growth in 2013, and this is a summary page. So 3% to 4% gross margin marketing kind of flattish, but remember as I explained the acquisition had some impact on that. Lots of leverage on SG&A, so round numbers as you know, our long-term algorithm is to expand operating margin 60 basis points, so we expect to do that again in 2013, and you know the rest with our dividend increase today of 17%. We have a dividend yield of about 2%.","And this actually 2012 is the 12th consecutive year that Church & Dwight has grown earnings per share of 10% or better and you see the 10 for 20 club there, so our idea there is by 2020 that we would have done it 20 years in a row. So 2013 would be the 13th year that we are shooting for. And now we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","James Craigie","Mr. Smith? I never knew you would need a mic, but go ahead","","Unidentified Analyst","Is there a plan to take the whole laundry portfolio to Forex concentrate at some point, so is this kind of a catastrophe how it goes and then ultimately you may want to convert the whole thing?","James Craigie","No it's not a test. We're launching this incrementally into the business, it is eventually the retailers of the world, it\u2019s not they want everybody to go to Forex, we would be perfectly happy taking our whole line. But right now this is between the launch of an incremental effort to our current business and we think about to please consumers tremendously, please retailers and I think as a result they are hopeful the retailers will say why isn\u2019t everything for everybody on a compacted basis.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you and did you say what retailers you are going to expand the distribution in? On the Avid business, is there a game plan to get the gross margin up above corporate averages and then can you just tell us what the business grew this year, because the market is doing pretty great relative to when you bought it, so\u2026","James Craigie","(Inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","Do you have a growth of the share, I know it\u2019s not a (gag) yet, just a business from that 2011 base\u2026","James Craigie","Double digits on the growth. That\u2019s all I will tell you and we do have a long-term game plan to get it up over the corporate average.","Unidentified Analyst","Great thanks.","James Craigie","(Bower)","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, I don\u2019t think in the press release was a breakout of the \u2013 what I would call non-recurring items in the first quarter tied to \u2013 could you tell us what they are in terms of inventory step up transition cost and deal cost?","Matthew Farrell","","Yeah, there actually no difference than we said previously, so\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","The $0.06?","Matthew Farrell","So the step-up cost were about $7.5 million and transaction costs were $4.5 million. So between two of that\u2019s $12 million, so it\u2019s $0.05 to $0.06.","Unidentified Analyst","And so, I guess in the guidance you said that Avid would had 4% to earnings, but if you just set out its more like 2, right?","Matthew Farrell","","Yeah. We don\u2019t think of it that way. So the way we think about it is, Avid was neutral to EPS in the fourth quarter. So, I know we can play games, and say what do we want to take in or out. But, we look at it has the EPS that Avid contributed fourth quarter is no different than if we bought on December 31. So consequently we say, we want everybody to understand this $0.13 of earnings per share in our numbers in 2013.","James Craigie","And don\u2019t forget we told you we are going to at least double marketing spending on Avid. We really, we stepped it up a little in Q4 but really that will take starting this quarter right now. So we are going to be smoothly increase the marketing spending to drive the strong growth here. So you can use Q4 really at the base of what happened because the marketing spending hadn\u2019t fully going to step up here \u2013 we have those step up charges and we just got in control of this business as far as distribution. But this will be a double-digit growth on revenues for us. We are going to spend some of that back in the marketing side to drive this business because we just \u2013 it\u2019s a long-term tiger by the tail we have here. We wanted to go \u2013 we have to get out there and do well as quickly as we can.","Unidentified Analyst","How fast is the kids, vitamin part growing for you?","James Craigie","","The kids vitamin part because we are already -- the kids \u2013 gummies are already over 50% of the total kid category. We already number one. So the growth there won\u2019t be as much as the adults because we are already a big number one player there in a category that\u2019s already well developed. It\u2019s growing; it will be more I will say mid-single digits. And then the adult side depending on how fast to get the distribution, how fast we drive the growth we definitely be a double digit growth category, how much will depend on, how fast we can get the distribution and spend the marketing dollars and get the trials. Because of the samples \u2013 sampling drives this business when you taste this product you are converted on the spot. So we got to do a lot of sampling progress. We will save some time. But, 2013 will be a great year to drive a lot of incremental distribution incremental sampling and then convert all these people to use this long-term especially on the adult side.","Unidentified Analyst","And do you think in your core business that detergents will grow faster than that 3% to 4%?","James Craigie","","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","And the last part is ARM & HAMMER are extra growing faster in 2013 of the two?","James Craigie","","Well, it\u2019s had a great year. Both are getting significant incremental distribution, both are great new product launching, we will be supporting those heavily and we had a great in 2012 fastest grower in the entire laundry category in 2012, biggest share gainer in 2012 and with what I know right now in 2013 to be another terrific year. No more, you are done. Next?","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, what do you building in for a promotional spending, I know you said there was going to be some sampling on some of the new products but just overall I know you always have a little bit of a gloomy attitude at the beginning of the year and the numbers usually come in better. So\u2026","James Craigie","","So you are talking gummies or everything?","Unidentified Analyst","I\u2019m talking everything.","James Craigie","","I think it\u2019s a pretty stable comparisons building out there. I think the business environment the economy is just kind of in a lower spin. We have seen every category for the past two years about half up and half have flatter down actually they are continuing. I don\u2019t see any difference. That\u2019s a little optimistic you won\u2019t believe that. I honestly think confidence in this country is starting to turn right now. And confidence always comes before the results. And if you watch what happened in the building industry is having a turnaround. And the building industry usually perceives an economy turnaround because new homes create needs for product in those homes and things like that.","So I\u2019m very encouraged to see the new home market picking up in this country and I think that will be the precursor hopefully maybe in 2014 or 2015, nothing will happen so much this year it takes time. But, I love the fact, I\u2019m seeing confidence in the consumer environment, they are starting to build and I hope that continues. I hope double net quits putting us in a crisis mode with these fiscal cliff issues and makes \u2013 quits getting everybody else nervous because when consumers get nervous they pull back. So hopefully I can file the budget crisis and look forward and I hope the building industry they continue to improve and maybe in 2014 or 2015 we will see some improvement in the GDP. I think 2013 is another whole year right now. But, I don\u2019t see things getting worse. I don\u2019t see in 2013 getting better. Hopefully I can spend a year from now and hopefully the data will support the beginning \u2013 turnaround in this country. So we will see.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just on the three to four organic, I know you kind of labeled that your assumptions were aggressive but I think achievable is your quote, the three to four I guess, if you think you about you are going to get Avid into the organic sales composition.","James Craigie","No, it\u2019s one quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","By the fourth quarter. You are getting increased distribution, you are already seeing laundry is going to grow faster than the total company. So, again, I understand that\u2019s an ever green target. But, when you flush it out a little bit more, I mean, what could really step\u2026","James Craigie","I said aggressive, but thinking more of the 14% EPS target nobody is going up the 14% in our industry. It\u2019s a tough competitive environment, we got a lot step go out there and we do expect to spend the marketing support to do. So I think very happy, my number one thing is the 14% EPS target. We are going to deliver that heck of a hell in a high water. And if there is competitive issues out there, we will deal with them, but that\u2019s a rougher target nobody, I know is even in double-digit range. So the 10%, I mean, we are 700 basis points above anybody else in this industry as far as EPS growth and I think that\u2019s extremely aggressive given what we face out there.","So could we \u2013 better 3 to 4, possibly but if we do, we will probably reinvest the money in the business with the marketing spending so I want to exit next year the share growth on leave three quarters of our brands ad maybe strong in the fourth quarter that formula has worked for us consistently. I told you, I will show you numbers that will stay in general our January results were very strong this year, so we are very off to a good start, you always worry; you have a good year and a good quarter. But the inventory loading is something that did not happen and I was gauged by how well January is \u2013 and January is off to a very good start. So I\u2019m very encouraged. So we are off to another good year, its one month, but I will take it. And then in the bag, we see what happens ago 11 months ago, I think that\u2019s a very, very positive about 2013 for my company.","(inaudible)","Unidentified Analyst","And just a two questions on gross margin, last year, you said you did 30 basis points on the base business and if you are sort of sticking with your long-term 25 to 50 for 2013, you will have a full year of partial compaction. You got a full year of the price increases in (inaudible), you got a full year of Victorville, so why couldn\u2019t we see something better than the 25 to 50 on the base business.","And then secondly a little help on the cadence of the gross margin this year because you have obviously got some shifting comparisons in the base period into 12 plus you got Avid.","Matthew Farrell","As far as the comparisons go, my favorable comparisons in the second half, so when you think about 5ish on a full year, you would expect to be down in the first half and up in the second half because Avid obviously we are going to get some of those synergies, $15 million of synergies, most of those come post 2013. But, it\u2019s some coming in the second half of this year.","Can we beat the 25 to 50 basis points maybe like Jim said its just like the 3% to 4%. So there is a lot of things that could happen during the year and we do a lot of pluses as well also have we have a lot of dry powder with which to deal with competitors.","James Craigie","Yeah, you are right. We have a lot of things in the pipeline we hope come true but that\u2019s still given where everybody else is these days, that still I think and could target but aggressive target on the core business and the mix claw down from the Avid business. So but we do a lot of good initiatives, we put a lot time last year with the new plants and everything else or even hopefully it will pay off and deliver at least that in 2013.","Bill?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, following up from the gross margin, looking back the last of round of compaction, did you ever quantify or could you quantify what you did to gross margin, I mean, was it 20 basis point, 300 basis points and as we look out this, is it that type of \u2013 if it was all implemented again, can you have that type of benefit or is there something we are structurally, a lot of the low hanging fruits are being grabbed?","James Craigie","It\u2019s about 472 time people have asked this for our historical gain (contraction). It was meaningful. It was the single largest product impact on gross margin in my tenure in this company I'll not you what is worth. Now this time (inaudible) on the entire flight. This time is just on the incremental piece. So, it certainly won\u2019t be a big 2013 if not it would be big if the whole business was converting and we hope the retailers of this country receive that, the consumers (inaudible) thumps up and the retailers will then especially the big one out there will get thumps up for the entire industry to those point and let's take this to it.","I'm encouraged by Clorox's action on bleach I hope that shows the way because the effort of anything we are the manufacturer do should be to grow a category and the same time bring benefits to consumers that they will appreciate and this effort does and I hope, what we are doing is kind of risky on our part to take the lead but again we did it only by the retailers being non-incremental everybody we'll talk to is willing to do that and add non-incremental to our business and hopefully consumers will start -- will react very strongly.","We are going to put some good strong marketing support behind this and I think we are guiding some of the outstanding way of putting the product out there with great package and offering 20% more loads to encourage people to bring the product on and try it. So, we have got great distribution, great displace for comments. Watching this quarter, as we speak you will see it popping up; you will see the commercial start mid to late this quarter and hopefully the results will be great and hopefully it will encourage the entire industry to move with a separate on a complete basis of line.","Unidentified Analyst","And on the distribution gains, I think one of the goals or possibilities out of (inaudible) was to maybe expand distribution on the West Coast and West coast Retailers is that part of what you are talking about in some of the distributions gains or is this still too early?","James Craigie","","Yes of course, we had already been expanding on the (inaudible) West Coast and (inaudible) lot of money to ship out to some major accounts out there. So look our games, there is nothing significantly different than games in the West Coast and elsewhere because now we can ship it out there a lot less. So, yes, we have had major gains in West Coast accounts are doing very well out there in fact I'll have to check with Mr. Tursi but I believe we are the number one laundry brand and one of the major accounts in the West Coast right now certainly by far the more value brand out there.","So, being able to shift a lot less distance so these accounts was going to is the reason we built (inaudible) plant. We are working so much the plant Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania was more from a processing basis because our previous plant was all just (inaudible) and that we made a very streamline plant that was all savings about processing and making the product. The Victorville plant was more of a case of saving logistics that. So, it would benefit us from having the -- much savings on the two heaviest products we make laundry detergent and cat litter. Next now he is going to be careful of caladium red.","Unidentified Analyst","What was the interest expense and why don't you to break it out and what are your plans for the balance sheet for next year?","Matthew Farrell","We actually do breakout interest expense when we file the 10-K you will see it. We typically do not do that in the Qs. For your interest expense for the company was $14 million probably you want to figure this out on your own, but next year it\u2019s going to be around 26. So, it'd be $12 million incrementally year-over-year. Often it\u2019s worth knowing with respect to other income as also our JV income. So, in 2012, I think it was $9 million, the expectation for next year is $7 million. That also a herd as well. So, those together that $14 million year-over-year.","I like to brag too the money we had to borrow to buy Avid acquisition, my finance set a record on Wall Street ever for a company at our rating level, correct?","Unidentified Company Speaker","Yeah, for 10-year money, yeah, BBB rated.","Unidentified Company Speaker","This goes to show the confidence that Wall Street has and investors have in us being able to pay off our debt and ","[Technical Difficulty]","I'm sorry, I can't hear you.","Unidentified Analyst","Plan to pay off any of it in '13 or what's the schedule?","Matthew Farrell","We certainly have the free cash flow to do that, so that would be an option.","Unidentified Analyst","First question on the international margins, I think you've seen sort of an outsized, if you will, EBIT margin expansion in the international business. Is that just a function of scale? And going forward, will the international business continue to close the gap with the domestic business or can you talk about that directionally?","And then, can you clarify sort of specifically your strategy with respect to Pods, I mean, God forbid you're wrong and Pods continue to do well over Tide, is that a segment of the category you just don't want to play in or even continue to invest behind it?","James Craigie","","Yeah, thank you (inaudible), very good. I'll take the second part of the (inaudible) expect for the margins. No, Pods is a very great product out there. We support it, we want (inaudible), we were first in the marketplace with our product. Over the course of a whole year we've got a fair share of the product out there. We're happy with it. We a little cautionary in Q4 we did expect those consumer issues with the Pods out there and we kind of pulled back the marketing support. It's sort of reality as to whether or not this product was going to face any potential recalls or anything because of the consumer news. So, our share of the market in the fourth quarter dipped a little bit but we were a little cautious. In fact, we're launching a sensitive skin version of it. I did mention that today out in 2013.","So, we fully support Pod is a fine product; its got a use out there. I think its particularly attractive to households; we have to go to (inaudible) or difficulty is easy to carry. I told you and I scream again from the pulpit, it is not helping to grow the (laundry) category in fact its hurting the laundry. People use less laundry detergent when they use a Pod they're going to have liquid or powder, but we fully supply the category. We're launching new products to support the category. We'll get our fair share of the category though we believe the answer going forward that's the best in this category, its doing another round of liquid compaction in this category. And we're going to wait for any retailers to tell us to do it, we're not going to wait so the manufacturers do it, we're going to take the lead.","Matt, the EBITDA margin is?","Matthew Farrell","Yeah, can you restate the question on EBITDA?","Unidentified Analyst","No, you just said the operating margin for the domestic business over the last two years I mean, there has been an expansion but not as much expansion as you have seen in the international business so the gap between the domestic margins and the international margins have narrowed and I'm wondering if that is going to continue?","Matthew Farrell","","The international business because it's fragmented and it's in many different countries its SG&A is typically higher percentage of sales than it is for the domestic business. It's also true for marketing because they are smaller brands they still have to spend more money proportionately. So, marketing as a percentage of sales as well as SG&A has been higher historically for the international business.","As far as the (other thing) that's been happening internationally is that we have been selling more household product into Canada and Mexico as a much lower margin so that's been putting pressure on their gross margins that's then brings them down closely to the domestic business and that will continue actually to the extent we continue to drive household in Canada and Mexico so it\u2019s really a mixed effect is what you are seeing.","If I could drill a bit too, we thought about distribution gains, that wasn't jus the U.S. we have some major distribution gains on our products going on and our current countries do so it's across the board. Again not because we actually didn't deserve it because our business has been growing so fast the distribution is always trying to catch up to it and our sales and marketing folks done of good job of convincing the retailers say, we need do more shelf space because you are getting out of stocks in our brand because it keep selling more and more.","James Craigie","Yes, sir.","Unidentified Analyst","Just two quick questions here. First on your 2013 EPS outlook was there anything in particular that convinced you to go to the higher end of your range maybe the strong January you had?","And then the second question on EPS, your longer-term I guess algorithm consistently you have proven on your base business that you can grow EPS 10% to 12% and your adding Avid, which obviously a top-line growth faster than the overall business and you are getting some cost synergies, which should benefit going forward for many years I would imagine. Why can't this business grow mid -teens instead of maybe the 10% to 12% EPS over the long-term?","Matthew Farrell","","Good question. The answer to your first part is, when we first made that call on 2013, we are only I think partway through Q4. Q4 finished stronger and this year started out (business) strong so that's why we raised our target up to we raised the bottom end of the target. Second thing is, I hope you right but we kind of feel at this point and time 14% is a very aggressive call versus the industry. We have to compete with people out there and (inaudible) we want to keep investing in the marketing side as best we can. So, if there is an opportunity to beat that we'll probably redeploy that money back into marketing our businesses and driving their shares for long-term success."," So, we love to having a model where we have the ability to invest and still deliver the best EPS results in the industry but we don't today if I could easily beat that"," non-performance strip up marketing or pull back in initiatives now they\u2019re going to go to the future. But I want to come here every year and tell you at least on a 12% which is nobody else has done the record and we have and I don\u2019t want to have a 20% a year I didn\u2019t get a 5% a year following it I think that good steady double digit growth has been a key of Church & Dwight. Our investors can account on it. It drives our stock price and the consistency of the whole market and the company if you hedge fund and your looking for short term gains go by somebody else. If you are somebody want to buy a stock and go to bed at night and get that 19% CAGR unit TSR by Church & Dwight. Thank you for that 30 second public announcement.","Way in the back, back from (inaudible) of producing a beautiful a baby.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Double thank you.","Matthew Farrell","I am not going into diaper business by the way so.","Unidentified Analyst","","So and by she loves Church & Dwight rattle.","Matthew Farrell","Thank you.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, it\u2019s good.","Matthew Farrell","Few money when you rattle with, got a dollar sign, I told you that.","Unidentified Analyst","So first in just in terms of the distribution gain so if the laundry compaction is incremental product how much of the distribution or is a lot of that incremental distribution in laundry business because of that product\u2026","Matthew Farrell","No I would say its about 50-50 on our base products we have just around distribution gains too on our base products so its going to be a fantastic year for the laundry category distribution gains because we need the more distribution our core products which have been growing steadily and had another record year and now we\u2019re launching this incrementally. So both sides of the business are doing very strong.","Unidentified Analyst","And any sense of where the incremental self space is coming from?","Matthew Farrell","Somebody else.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Matthew Farrell","Somebody who is not growing their shares.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then in terms of wide space entries. I mean last year you talked about wide space entries and some of them kind of were later in the year but how much did you say those ended up adding to your sales growth this year?","Matthew Farrell","It\u2019s a good question. But I honestly I don\u2019t know the quantitative answer to that is certainly is going to help us we had good results last year. I mean sometimes you have a wide space is tough and there is incumbents there they don\u2019t want to see you there. Everything we did last year got off to a great start we\u2019re barely upon it this year. I mean we\u2019re taking on major players like KY like a 60, 70 share lubricants out there. And so there is going to be incumbents who are not going to roll over but we\u2019re being very careful on this we\u2019re not betting the bank of the company on these things we\u2019re launching these categories with products we've been working on for several years with good strong marketing support and we\u2019ll take a one step at a time. And I expect everyone of cases we\u2019re here we\u2019re going to build our share from last year and go forward form there.","So we\u2019re not I think, you should comfortable we\u2019re not taking all our marketing money and throwing up behind these initiatives which are riskier because we\u2019re going up against incumbents out there my sales force has got an outstanding job I can tell the lubricant line is getting out there and distribution support out there. I told you I gave the team (inaudible) his team here with new products that charge, I want to be X brand on this category bring excitement news and young feeling to all, very aspirational two versus the big guy out there who we kind of feel is out and dated and not really aggressively pushing the categories, so we are trying to bring that x type feel which is the massive success in the deodorant side of the world. So, I want to think its just \u2013 it will be meaningful, it will be meaningful and these products all carry very good gross margin to them. But we are not going to -- trust me \u2013 some of them don\u2019t do as well which I don\u2019t expect but we still make our numbers. We still feel confident when we make our numbers on these, we will start to build a very strong presence here.","And like I said our goals to be the leading premium lubricant, I should tell you that too, the lubricant category there is a lot of lower priced products. These products are selling for obviously about $14, $15 a box. Yeah, this is the upper end of the premium market. We are not coming into low price entry, which are good chunk of the market. We don\u2019t want to get down the low price, we are going into the upper end of the market. So like x in the category, in the upper price range of the category and that we believe the TROJAN name of the products deserve. So its very good gross margin which enables to have the marketing spending to support these products.","And the winner to is, in fact, we are using existing trademark name. So I think, I told you the story earlier, we want launched Alexa\u2013 I don\u2019t know 6, 7 years ago was my brainstorm, we lost a whole new condom line TROJAN Alexa, that was mostly Alexa side but TROJAN was there. We spend a fair amount of money on it. The line itself did not do well. We actually have to pull it out of the market but because we have spent money at TROJAN Alexa, it help to build only the best tier ever on the base condom business.","So that\u2019s how smart, we didn\u2019t come in within brand x name on lubricants TROJANs. So all that money, we are increasing pretty significantly amount of money we are spending on TROJAN this year and that will help the entire franchise, TROJAN Vibrators, TROJAN Condoms and TROJAN Lubricants. If I have to build a mega brand and Bruce Fleming my head of marketing gang are outstanding out into the advertising, so you do get a sense of the TROJAN brand as you go out there and so everyday we spend will help you entire the line not just the new form in there, both in HAMMER, HAMMER success story I used to tell you all the details here but.","ARM & HAMMER when I came here, this was on 2004 was totally what you call desperate brand, the packaging was different, the advertising was different, we spend a dollar of detergent, the new health toothpaste, and Bruce is doing brilliant job, pulled together the advertising, the packaging and everything and that\u2019s why ARM & HAMMER which is a 160 years old, double digit in pretty tough category. We are planning that same thinking","I would tell you we are the masters of mega branding. I truly feel that I will tell Coca-Cola, great master two, we are terrific ahead of mega brand, a brand. And that enables you to smartly spend the money and not to just blow money up on a new brand and new category which \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t work, you doesn\u2019t wait for the money 100%. This money will not be waste, it will help grow the mega brand. But its like this is the next new thing, we do ARM & HAMMER, we continue to grow that and we are expanding that to new categories, we are taking ARM & HAMMER to Spinbrush now, we took the ARM & HAMMER in an aim to simply failing now, so we will continue to grow that business. We\u2019ve got lot of licensing on that business."," I told you before ARM & HAMMER is in more aisles of the grocery store in your brand in America more categories in your brand in America added feel to the growth of a brand, which was going 1% when I and my team walked into the door, now its growing over 10% of the total brand. Now apply that same thinking that TROJAN when I look forward in the future I think some of their brands on our portfolio have mega branding status, which we're beginning to see with OxiClean, now into dishwashing out the soap. A very successful thing we do very well and I think is a way to good results as we go into these white space categories, I hate that term, but its like five categories should make sense. So\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. The 20% free loads that you have on the compacted detergent, is that meant to be introductory promo spending or is that kind of a baseline price point where you think the compacted detergent will be?","James Craigie","That\u2019s baseline. And it's not a bonus pack. It will be ongoing, correct? Correct. Yes they are nodding their heads.","Unidentified Analyst","Right and is it \u2013 I guess compared to the last time compaction went through where I guess the effort was to maintain price points where you are letting it slip because you guys are going so well and leading it, is that kind of a rationale?","James Craigie","We are maintaining price points. This is from the line price with they call the 2X product. So it would be line price that\u2019s compacted, in this case kind of an encroachment for people to go over to a slightly small package we are offering 20% more loads in it. So I think it was very brilliant move on our part to give people the incentive to- well, it's a little smaller, same price, oh, it offers more Washloads. Great, let\u2019s try. Yes sir.","Unidentified Analyst","I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on share repurchases, you showed the dry powder slide and your leverage is still if you know well I think under where your longer-term targets are, so anything here for 2013 and then may beyond?","Unverified Speaker","Yeah we just to remind everybody, our most recent authorization was $300 million. We had $20 million left on the old authorization. So we had $320 going into the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter we spend $50 million and in January spend another $50 million. So we spend $100 million of the $320 that we had going into the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that we are done for the year, so that remaining amount of shares are dry powder for share repurchase will be used in 2014 and 2015. And it\u2019s largely the cover share creep.","James Craigie","Yes sir.","Unidentified Analyst","I think when we got together last year you had mentioned that you had spent probably more time looking at acquisitions, than you had in \u2013 before - and I was just wondering if you could sort of give us an update on your thoughts of sort of what's out there now, and maybe what your views on bid-ask spread of buyers and sellers at this point?","James Craigie","Yeah so we are still aggressively on the trail. I\u2019m walking out of this meeting right now and half and hour to a meeting in a side room here to look at an acquisition. We've made business, we bought Vitafusion and other acquisitions we\u2019re very selective. I think its an interesting time out there about that I told you I\u2019ve been very surprisingly down sided that they\u2019re have been more acquisitions out there in the marketplace because cash is dirt cheap. Businesses are struggling organically out there. I am surprised that there wasn\u2019t more spin off and divisions or mergers of companies but I think I told you, I think that this would happened is stock market treated everybody pretty well despite lower forecast of organic growth in earnings so companies didn\u2019t feel the pressure, so we have to acquire something and bring a company in, driving synergies driving EPS back up.","But I think with cash flow relatively cheap above debt I think you might see some more I don\u2019t know there is a lot of actually out there honestly the sellers still have pretty lofty multiples in their heads for their businesses which is leading to a lot of sales don\u2019t happen because they want a lot more than anybody who is willing to buy. I think that\u2019s pretty smart on the buyers, buyers are staying pretty smart is not overpaying there have been some deals we've seen which we shook our heads at we stopped and we brought the (budgeting) business the competitor of ours bought another business in that space that twice in multiple we bought the business that we would thank them very much because we compete with them. So I hope they\u2019re totally overwhelmed by what the price they bought but I don\u2019t know they\u2019ve been a great company over time we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see.","There is a lot of activity there is a lot of activity people offering (inaudible) still the road block to more activities the sellers really want too much money for their businesses than that so but we\u2019re very active because we got math so we got a ton of dry powder but we\u2019re very selective and we love this last acquisition there is tremendous potential for us going forward in a tremendous category and we\u2019re looking for businesses like that as we go forward. And we\u2019ll just keep looking","So then we\u2019ll go running to one of the side rooms here to see who is there but we\u2019re looking we constantly look and a lot of time in the road looking at stuff because it is a part of that we\u2019re great at it and my team I can\u2019t complement enough -- I sometimes tell people they have to work for greatest strength at Church & Dwight I think there is a lot but at sometimes seems our ability integrated business is one of our greatest strength and all my functions do a brilliant job of bringing those businesses in fast creating accretion. I mean you know a lot of acquisitions on accretive year one, Avid is going to be we told you going to add 5% to our earnings I don\u2019t think the company is going to do that on a scale like that and we do it and seriously absorb that we are looking right now more acquisition is coming on stream and (they haven\u2019t) we\u2019ll take them you might, we\u2019ll say I cant put our trajectory you never know until they happen I know exactly what I\u2019d like to buy right now I can guarantee we\u2019ll get to our satisfactory price with the people trying to sell those business and if we cant no deal and if we can great.","Are there question from wonderful crowd here? Well, anyways I want to thank you very much for\u2026","Unidentified Company Speaker","Hey, we have \u2013 I\u2019m sorry confused. I\u2019m sorry.","Unidentified Analyst","On the latest round of compaction, how much water is coming out of the bottle and what\u2019s the change in the size of the bottle?","James Craigie","I need my technical genius back in the corner there. This is (inaudible) can you give that in a round number so that I will\u2026","Unidentified Company Speaker","(Inaudible)","James Craigie","All of you, I want to thank you for all coming today for the New York Exchange, two things, we had the most fantastic goody bag you have ever seen in the back of the room, with a lot of new product we talked about today. Please don\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s in it, until you get home in your kitchen with your children around you may want to check that do that before you do that. But with all that exciting products we have the wonder action tooth brush in there, we have the new lubricant line in there, you may want to take that out. We have new gummies in there for adults, please try out, if you haven\u2019t tried adult gummies. I think we have two in there. All the cool store product is in there. So all of our hot, hot new items in that goody bag. And if you really boarded at 3:59 and 45 seconds, you will see my ugly face and my team on CNBC today ringing the closing bell. Thank you."],"5095":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call January 31, 2020  1:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Matthew Farrell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Britta Bomhard - Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer","Steven Cugine - Executive Vice President International and GNPI","Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Paul Wood - Executive Vice President, U.S. Sales","Conference Call Participants","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc","Joe Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies & Co.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Matthew Farrell","Okay, gang. We\u2019re going to get going now. Okay. Thank you all for coming today and thanks, everyone, who is dialing in from office or home. I\u2019m going to begin with the Safe Harbor statement. I recommend everybody to read that at your leisure. Say who is with us today from management, we have our CMO, Britta Bomhard; our Head of International and Global New Products, Steve Cugine; our General Counsel, if you have any legal questions; Rick Dierker, our CFO; Rick Spann, who runs Supply Chain; and Paul Wood, who runs U.S. Sales.","All right. So here\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m going to give you a short story right now. So you don\u2019t have to really pay attention to the other 150 slides. We had a terrific year. This is the second consecutive year that our company grew organic sales 4%. The U.S. posted 4% organic sales growth and 10 out of 12 of our power brands grew or held share. International posted 9.2% organic growth and continues to be a juggernaut for the company.","And as we ended the year, organic growth returned to the Specialty Products business after two down years. Last time, we had an up quarter was Q4 2017. And the reason it turned positive is because the dairy market became healthy. And another encouraging sign is that domestic volumes turned positive in the fourth quarter. And finally, we had record cash from operations in 2019.","So now looking ahead to 2020. We\u2019re calling 3.5% organic growth, and that is net of exiting the low-margin gummy private label business. And consistent with our Evergreen model, we\u2019re calling 7% to 9% EPS growth and that is top tier in CPG.","Now I want to recap for a minute why Church & Dwight is a standout in the consumer space. Number one, we have an Evergreen model that our shareholders are very familiar with as our employees. Number two, we focus on cash. Number three, we have an ability to execute and that\u2019s what drives our performance.","We deliver meaningful top line and bottom line growth year-after-year. We have a very lean company with the highest sales per employee of any of our peers, and that sales per employee stat is an underappreciated metric. We are innovators with new product offerings across many categories year-after-year and we\u2019re becoming digitally savvy.","The 8% of our sales are online today and that does not include buy online, pickup in store. If we included that, it\u2019d be much higher than 8%. But we made good choices when it comes to acquisitions. Those choices have led us to dry shampoo, gummy vitamins, women\u2019s hair removal, water flossers and hair thinning solutions. So we believe there\u2019s no better place to invest in CPG than Church & Dwight.","So here\u2019s our track record. Let\u2019s go to the next slide. Here we are. So look at our last three, five and 10 years, we delivered double-digit TSR returns to our shareholders. And if you look at 2019, 8.3%, and that\u2019s on top of a 2018 that was plus 30%.","Let\u2019s move on to the formal part of the program. So who we are, why we\u2019re winning. Britta is going to come up and talk about them \u2013 give you an update for the master brand. And also Britta and I are going to ham and egg the consistent innovation story. Steve is going to come up and talk about international, I\u2019ll kind of come back and tell you about animal productivity and how we run the company, and then we\u2019re going to end with Rick on financials.","All right, first, who we are. So let\u2019s talk about our Evergreen business model. This is in green not only in the hearts of our employees, but all of our long-term shareholders as well, 3% top line, 8% bottom line. And if you say, well, how\u2019s it going for you? And you look at the last 10 years, the average organic sales growth has been 6 \u2013 3.6%.","So where\u2019s that 3% coming from? Well, it\u2019s kind of 2% from the U.S., 6% international and 5% Specialty Products. We don\u2019t always hit this in the market any one year, but that is the long-term algorithm. If you say, what are your brands? We have lots and lots of brands. Well, we have 12 power brands. And those 12 power brands account for 80% of our revenues and profits. And we have very well-balanced portfolio. A little bit more than half is \u2013 or consumer products part of the house.","For those of you at home, those are just couple of balloons going off. The personal care, 49%; household, 44%; and you can see Specialty Products at 7%. Now it\u2019s a diversified portfolio, in that, 63% is premium and 37% is value. That means we perform well in virtually any economy. And we have a lot of runway for international. So international has been a juggernaut, as I\u2019ve said, for the last five years, still only 70% of the company. So we\u2019ve got a long way to go there.","And we do operate in the land of the giants. You can see, we have $4.4 billion in sales, all of our competitors are significantly larger than we are. We think this gives us an advantage. So we\u2019re fast, we\u2019re nimble. When you have only 4,700 \u2013 4,800 employees, you can make quick decisions, you can move fast, your communication is easier, and you can adapt to change better. And we have a long history of acquisitions.","We\u2019ve added almost $3 billion in sales since 2004 over the last 15 years, and a lot of that came from acquisitions. And we have very specific acquisition criteria. We\u2019re only going to look for a brand that has number one or number two share, high-growth, high-margin, needs to be asset-light. We need to be able to leverage our supply chain footprint and they must have a sustainable competitive advantage.","And since the year 2000, so over the last 19, 20 years, we\u2019ve acquired 11 out of our 12 power brands. In the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. So what we say around the house is 12 brands today, 20 tomorrow.","Now why are we winning? We have five reasons. One, we\u2019re in the right categories; two, we know how to grow shares; three, we don\u2019t have a high exposure to private label. We\u2019re growing online and we are on trend.","So let\u2019s look at the categories. So if you look at the categories over the last four years, in general, our categories\u2019 weighted average grow 3%. So this is the underpinning for the company\u2019s long-term organic growth of 3%.","As far as growing share, this is our report card. You don\u2019t get this report card for many CPG companies. but every year, we tell you how we\u2019re doing. So for our 12 major brands, we maintain our growth share. And you can see this year for the first time 10 out of 12, we\u2019re green. And we get lots of questions generally about the laundry category. So what\u2019s the long-term trend in laundry? So over the last three years, we\u2019ve had 120 basis points of share in laundry. The other winner was Procter & Gamble and Henkel has struggled.","Now, you know, as we go from quarter-to-quarter, you\u2019ll have some questions on non-measured channels. Let me give you a sense for how big our non-measured channels for some of our categories. Most of these categories are going to be 70%, 80%, 90% represented on Nielsen. But if you go to the far right, you\u2019ll see some of our more recent categories, power flossing, hair thinning and even electric \u2013 women\u2019s electric grooming are all significantly less than 50%. So something to bear in mind going forward.","We have low exposure to private label. The weighted average share of private label for our categories is only 12%. Only five of our categories have private label exposure. And as you can see from the lines on that chart, you can see it\u2019s relatively stable and we\u2019re growing online.","Back in 2015, we were fourth quartile when it came to online sales. Today, we are first quartile. We hit our goal of 8% in 2019 and we have a goal to be over 9% in 2020, and we have lots of products \u2013 number one products on Amazon. And Amazon, of course, is the number one online retailer.","Okay, on trend. So we\u2019re all through four of our brands and while we think we\u2019re on trend. Take BATISTE, it\u2019s a business we acquired in 2011. So dry shampoo was a convenient solution to women between wet shampoos. This was a business with $20 million in sales in 2011. If you look at what kind of runway do you have in the U.S.?","Well, in the U.S., 125 million women \u2013 there are 125 million women over the age of 18. Two-thirds of them don\u2019t wash their hair every day and 13% of them today use dry shampoo.","Now, if you look at household penetration, it\u2019s only 7.5% in the U.S. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to figure out, well, how big could it be in the U.S. We look at the UK. The UK is the most mature dry shampoo market, that\u2019s where it originated. So if we compare with where the U.S. is, the U.S. is in the middle innings. And we can see by in comparison to where the UK is that the dry shampoo market will double from $225 million at retail to $450 million over time. So being the number one dry shampoo means, we have a lot of runway ahead of us.","So next up is women\u2019s electric hair removal. So we bought the number one women\u2019s electric hair remover in FLAWLESS. So these are tools to remove \u2013 so I\u2019ll go left to right, face, brow, leg and whole body. So women are looking for convenient ways to remove hair. And if you look at the household penetration, it\u2019s only 2% in the U.S. and less than 2% rest of the world, so a lot of runway here for this business.","Next up is water flossers. We have the number power pulse and recommended by the ADA. So what\u2019s the story there? We can do a show of hands. Everybody knows, 80% of the people don\u2019t floss everyday, even though they should. And consumers are discovering water flossers. Water flossers are the easiest solution to flossing.","Again, look at household penetration. 22% in the U.S. not bad, but we think that could go as high as 48% if you just look at the penetration for electric toothbrushes. And then if you look at \u2013 in Europe, for example, it\u2019s only 3% to 5%. So we\u2019re just getting started with water flossers outside the U.S. Again, on trend, got a lot \u2013 lots of runway ahead of us.","Next up is gummy vitamins. You know the story pretty well. The gummy form is more appealing than pills and capsules. And if you go back to when we bought the business, the adult gummy form was 3% of the category. Now it\u2019s 18%. And if you look at the size of the category, it just continues to grow. It grew from 2015 to 2016, 2017 from $800 million to $1.5 billion today, lots of runway.","And then finally, is hair thinning solutions. We have the number one hair fiber and the number one hair thinning supplement. We all know it\u2019s on people\u2019s mind. 40% of men and women have noticeable hair loss by the age of 40. So we have great solutions to that.","And now I\u2019m going to bring up Britta to talk about the master brand.","Britta Bomhard","Okay. Hello, everyone. [indiscernible] So you might remember, ARM & HAMMER is by far our biggest brands. It\u2019s more than a million \u2013 billion, sorry, dollar brand. So really important to us. And you might remember from last year, we presented our more Power to You campaign year in this iconic institution. Now, I know most of you are pretty skeptical. You\u2019re a little bit like my boss. Is this really working? So I thought, why don\u2019t I share a couple of results first.","Since we launched the campaign in 12 months, we\u2019ve actually added 2.6 million households who are now buying ARM & HAMMER, and that\u2019s an increase of 3%. And this picture you\u2019re seeing is actually, it is currently nearly seven out of 10 households buying ARM & HAMMER. And if this room is representative, my ambition is actually to have three out of four households buying ARM & HAMMER.","So you might remember, there\u2019s not many where the U.S. is as united as having three out of four people agree that this is a great choice. But what\u2019s more important? You could now say, well, but you get them in via promotions? No. Actually, we have people spent more money on ARM & HAMMER, and you see here they\u2019re spending 5% more.","So if you think about it, what is a great sign for brand health? More people buying it and spending more. So I think that\u2019s very clear answer that ARM & HAMMER is very healthy and growing wonderfully, right?","There we go. And I think for those of you who saw it last year, you might want to note that we have ARM & HAMMER every single one of our brands and categories. And I want to show you a couple of how we communicate about ARM & HAMMER. And for those of you who have seen some of our cats, they just got cuter. So just have a look at the cats.","[Commercials]","That\u2019s a really distinctive campaign and it\u2019s working really well for us. You might not have seen this campaign, because we just recently launched our ARM & HAMMER dental campaign at the very end of last year, it\u2019s a very hard one to break through. So I hope, A, you appreciate how different it is to a normal dental commercial you might see; and secondly, it also illustrates that this campaign works in no matter what category. So let\u2019s look at that one.","[Commercials]","Challenged and check, how well the plaque removal is currently on what you use. And moving on to our next, you might know, if you\u2019re not part of the Burning Man crowd, and I\u2019m pretty sure most of us here in this room aren\u2019t, then this one is what we say is a great deodorant.","[Commercials]","This is a broad spectrum of what we can do with the ARM & HAMMER campaign on every single of those different categories, playing to what\u2019s important and what\u2019s the consumer insight, but still bringing it all together and driving the overall 1 billion brands. So I think that\u2019s pretty unique.","But I\u2019m actually here to talk about something new. Well, it\u2019s not too much of a rear wheel as it\u2019s standing or sitting on all your tables, but our new CLEAN & SIMPLE laundry detergent. It\u2019s clean, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s smart and it\u2019s powerful.","So what have we learned about consumers and you might have seen that in a few other areas. In food, the transparency in less is more in ingredients has already been quite established. And this trend is now moving from what people ingested to what\u2019s on me and then to what\u2019s around me. And this is where we have an amazing detergent, which has a no compromise, powerful, clean laundry with a simple ingredient list.","So none of the others offer that. And what\u2019s even better of it and it\u2019s a pity that my colleague, Carlos, who heads up our R&D, is not here today. But he and his team are really revolutionizing of how we look at making innovation.","One part is, there\u2019s a very different innovation in culture. We are connecting the different teams around R&D and the different areas of expertise, a lot more risk-taking and obviously speed. And that\u2019s what you can see here how we came up and looking at what\u2019s happening in the food industry, it\u2019s a very clear trend, which will come into the other areas. And that\u2019s where our future works team actually discovered the CLEAN & SIMPLE formulation.","So what\u2019s in there, or better what\u2019s not in there? Because that\u2019s what consumers are asking. So it doesn\u2019t have dyes, no added preservatives, no phosphates, no brighteners and no parabens. It sounds pretty attractive, doesn\u2019t it? But what\u2019s in there is six Essential Ingredients: a hard-working cleaner, active stain remover, laundry booster, baking soda, of course, water softener and fragrance. And what is more and important, it has few ingredients, but it is as powerful as our best selling product, which is ARM & HAMMER with OXICLEAN.","And as we said, it has fewer ingredients not only as our own, but a typical average laundry detergent has between 15 and 30 ingredients, so we only have six. And here, less is more. But not only that, it\u2019s also very good for the environment. So on the next iteration of laundry bottles, you will actually see this back label, which we\u2019ll talk about our partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation, where we help planting trees for cleaner air and water.","This product is also being elected as a Safer Choice, so we have that endorsement, which is very important to reassure consumers. And we\u2019re also using the Green-e, which says it\u2019s 100% certified renewable electricity. And, of course, we\u2019re one of the leading partners of how to recycle, which is in a lot of our labels and also graces this label as the bottle is fully recyclable. And now you wonder how will we tell consumers about it. So let\u2019s have\u2026","[Commercials]","I hope you noticed. We\u2019re helping women making the right choices and we have very positive feedback, because it\u2019s such a good way to get it from a trusted brand like ARM & HAMMER. And once we drive people to store, this is what they will see in the future. We have massive executions in stores and coming soon, Dollar General. Sorry, that was too quick, can you go back? Wait, if I can do that.","So what else do consumers want besides CLEAN & SIMPLE? There\u2019s other trends, which are about sustainability and convenience. And Matt talked about online shopping, lots and lots of more people actually order online, that\u2019s not as developed in the laundry area, because it\u2019s difficult to ship big bottles.","So we have a solution for consumers who want convenience and sustainability, because we have launched ARM & HAMMER plus OXICLEAN, our best seller as a super concentrated laundry detergent. It has three times more cleaning power, but it has 37% less plastic and uses 30% less water. So, again, fully on a sustainability trend and available to consumers who prefer shopping on e-commerce.","I\u2019ve talked a lot about ARM & HAMMER. We also have another exciting brand, OXICLEAN. And if I look around the room, except for everybody who is on my team today, you know that black clothes, dark clothes are very important. And about 42% of all wash loads get sorted into black, dark colors and we have a solution for that.","So OxiClean Dark Protect, which is specifically formulated for dark and black fabrics. So as we\u2019re now in winter season, take a note, you might want to get one of those.","And with that, I hand it over to Matt, who is going to share insights on hair care.","Matthew Farrell","All right. Obviously, I\u2019m the expert on dry shampoo. So if you\u2019re somebody with normal hair and you pick up an aerosol can of dry shampoo, that\u2019s okay, that might make my hair dryer. So we said, \u201cHey, what\u2019s going to appeal to women with normal to dry hair?\u201d So we said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to launch Batiste Waterless Cleansing Foam. So this is something that you rub into your hair and refreshes your hair and dries in 60 seconds, and we have four different variants we\u2019re launching right now.","And now WATERPIK. You also often hear us talk about WATERPIK water flossers. Well, WATERPIK, that business, we\u2019re experts in water-jet technology. So that technology has been around for almost 50 years. And so now we\u2019re coming out with a brand-new, the first-known FDA-registered showerhead. And the insight here is that, millions of Americans discuss massage with their doctors, it\u2019s something that WATERPIK folks look into.","So here it is, WATER FOR WELLNESS, this FDA-registered power pulse showerhead. And we\u2019ve done nine clinical studies. And what those studies tell us is that, these particular showerheads soothes muscles, they increase flexibility and they promote better sleep.","And here\u2019s kind of a fun fact. The average shower is eight to 12 minutes. And what our consumers tell us is that, these benefits they start feeling after two minutes using these showerheads, really cool innovation.","Okay, I talked a little bit about FLAWLESS earlier. Women are look \u2013 are focused on convenient hair removal. So new product from FLAWLESS called NU RAZOR. This is waterless, whole body hair removal anywhere, anytime.","Now, floss, we\u2019ve got a lot of interest in FLAWLESS on the part of analysts and shareholders. So let\u2019s give a little bit of update on that. One major retailer right now, the reset has already happened from As Seen On TV through the wet shave aisle, and that\u2019s happening in a lot of retailers. Why is that important? It\u2019s because the traffic in the wet shave aisle is four times the traffic in As Seen On TV.","So this is launching right now with one major retailer, wherein after two weeks, the POS consumption is up 7%, and that\u2019s just one major retailer. We know what kind of wins we have for 2020 and our total distribution point is going to be up 15% in 2020. And recall, if you read it in the press release that we expect the FLAWLESS sales to be up to 15% and this is part of the underpinning for that, as well as the NU RAZOR launch, we think we\u2019re going to be in good shape for the coming year.","All right. Next up is natural toothpastes are growing 14 times the rate of the toothpaste category. So we\u2019re introducing ARM & HAMMER Essentials Toothpaste, two different variants, and we\u2019ve gotten really, really good reception from retailers, particularly the drug class trait.","Next up, men, this is TROJAN condoms, wait for it. Men wants to ensure their partner is satisfied. So we got a new product called G SPOT from TROJAN and we have an ad for you. Take a look.","[Commercials]","We always have a lot of fun with that TROJAN brand. By the way, whenever we have a meeting for new products, it\u2019s the most \u2013 for TROJAN, it\u2019s the most well-attended meeting in the company, if you look people sitting on the window sills.","All right. VMS, so vitamin. We have lots of line extensions coming in 2020, and we are addressing a lot more need states. And we\u2019ve really picked up pace of innovation for vitamins. If you look at 2017 and 2018, we kind of averaged six new items a year. We had 22 new items in 2019. We\u2019ve got 17 more coming in 2020. Too many to run through today. And we have more innovation coming in 2020 in other categories, so stay tuned. You\u2019ll hear about those later in the year.","And next up is Steve to tell you our fabulous international story. Come on up, Steve.","Steven Cugine","Thank you, Matt.","Matthew Farrell","All right.","Steven Cugine","Excellent. So I\u2019m pleased to be here to share with you the fabulous international growth story. So, as Matt already talked about, the Evergreen target for international is 6% per year. In 2014, we delivered $535 million in sales. We finished 2019 at $756 million in sales.","The important note here is that, we firmly believe that we\u2019ve reached global scale. There isn\u2019t a market that we\u2019re not in today and where we can\u2019t reach with ourselves through our existing subsidiary markets or through our GMG business. I think even more impressive than the size of the business is that we tripled the organic growth rate from roughly 3% to about 9%. So significant, the larger business tripling the growth rate.","This is an important chart that we show every year, but there\u2019s some new information here. Our Global Markets Group is now 33% of the total business. For the first time, it is the largest segment within the international business, followed by Canada, Europe, three countries, Mexico, and Australia.","We have grown historically well above our Evergreen target of 6%. In 2019, we hit 9.2%, an outstanding year, and we leave the year with momentum delivering 10.6%. So we feel the wind at our back.","Let\u2019s break that down in a little more detail. Our subsidiary markets delivered 5.2% and our GMG business, a whopping 19.2%. Our subsidiaries are largely in developed markets. So 5.2% in developed markets is really outstanding performance. Our brands are healthy, whether they be in emerging markets or GMG or in our subsidiary markets. So we\u2019re excited about the performance of both of these businesses.","The GMG business is certainly an engine of growth for the division and for the company. Since 2014, when we initiated the start of our new growth strategy for international, this business has delivered 19% CAGR throughout its lifecycle. And again, 2019, we did 19.2%, lot of 19s in there. And it\u2019s driven by our core brands. So we\u2019re driving ARM & HAMMER, BATISTE, WATERPIK, VMS, OXICLEAN, STERIMAR, FEMFRESH and now FLAWLESS.","We continue to invest in building capabilities around the world. As you know, year in year out, I\u2019ve been up here talking about the investments that we\u2019ve made in Southeast Asia and then talk about China. We continue to make incremental investments in China, Southeast Asia, Germany, fast-growing market for us in Europe and in Central America.","We\u2019ve taken the opportunity to localize the content that we give to consumers, because these brands need to show up differently market-by-markets, so they\u2019re relevant. We\u2019re investing, particularly last year and this year in technology, because Matt talked about speed of decision-making we feel is a differentiator for the company. That is also true in these very dynamic international markets.","We invest a lot in our GMG distributor training and regulatory affairs. We want to make sure that our partners in particular markets know as much as we do. We provide them innovation, case studies. That share case studies. So they are an extension of our family, and we think that is unique to Church & Dwight.","So we\u2019re absolutely committed to 6% organic growth moving forward. We believe we have a runway for our existing brands. We have demonstrated our ability to grow acquired brands, WATERPIK, now FLAWLESS. Our GMG group will continue to post double-digit growth and we made investments in fast-growing markets that we think we can leverage. Because we feel that we have a scaled global business for the first time, we\u2019re going to make a new commitment. And that commitment is not only organic growth, but we\u2019re going to continue to expand operating margin year in and year out.","We\u2019re going to take a big step change from 2019 to 2020. And part of our Evergreen target is to deliver another 50 bps of growth \u2013 of operating margin expansion. And that is on top of any incremental investments that we\u2019re going to make to ensure that we have the capabilities around the world.","So in summary, one, we have the right strategies for growth. We\u2019ve demonstrated that, we know that. Two, we have brands that consumers love around the world. Three, we built a management team that is outstanding and several of them are around the world are here today. So to them, I say thank you. And we feel that we\u2019re just starting. But there is a lot of runway in international markets for Church & Dwight\u2019s products.","Dropped the mic.","Matthew Farrell","That was another balloon for you at home.","Steven Cugine","I see.","A - Matthew Farrell","Wow, that was perfect punctuation mark. Okay, animal punctuation. So back to the algorithm \u2013 3% algorithm, 2% U.S., 6% international and 5% for Specialty Products. Where is the 5% going to come from?","Well, we have a bulk chemicals business, which is bulk sodium bicarbonate and then animal productivity, 6%. How has that been working out for you? Not very well. Well, let\u2019s talk about why is that.","So this one goes \u2013 flow on this. When you look at the top of the chart, that\u2019s Specialty Products Division organic sales growth since 2011. So what do you notice? We\u2019re up in 2011, down in 2012 and 2013. Up in 2014, 22.6%, down in 2015 and 2016, up in 2017, down 2018 and 2019, back up in 2020. And then below it, you say, \u201cOkay, what was going on with milk prices.\u201d And you can see, as milk prices recover, that\u2019s when you see a green for the growth at a Specialty Products business.","So we knew that a few years ago, 2015, we said, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got to start moving into other species.\u201d And in 2015, 99% of the animal productivity business was dairy. And today, that\u2019s not true. It was 1% non-dairy. Today, it\u2019s 27% non-dairy. So we think that we\u2019re going to be able to flatten this out over time.","Now, why do we go into other species? Well, because of demand for protein and simply population growth. We have 7.7 people \u2013 7.7 billion people today going to 9.8 billion by the middle of the century. And antibiotics are out of favor. And the consumers are telling retailers and farmers, \u201cHey, no antibiotics, no hormones, no chemicals.\u201d","And if you look at the stats, you see that there\u2019s a 40% decrease in the use of animal probiotics since 2015. So that bodes well for us, because we bought two businesses. One was called VI-COR, the other was Agro BioSciences. They get us into prebiotics and custom probiotics. We were in nutritional supplements for dairy. We then got into prebiotics and probiotics. So now we have a nice portfolio for not only dairy, but cows, swine and poultry.","So as I said before, the non-dairy business is 27% of animal productivity. Today, we think that\u2019s going to have big growth in 2020. And we get lots of questions about milk. Hey, people raise their hands. Isn\u2019t milk consumption in the United States on decline? Absolutely. So if you look at this chart here, the per capita consumption of 2015 was 174 pounds annually. More recently, it\u2019s 164 pounds.","But if you look what\u2019s going on with cheese, big offset to that. It takes 10 pounds of milk to make one pound cheese. And then when you comes to the Church & Dwight Conferences, you always walk away learning something you didn\u2019t know. So when you think about milk, also think cheese. Cheese is a big offset for the decline in milk production. So the dairy industry does have growth ahead of it.","So we feel good long-term about our algorithm of 5%. We have the trusted brand. The ARM & HAMMER brand goes across prebiotics, probiotics, all of our products. We are aligned with the consumer trend, we\u2019re now into multiple species, and all the growth is ahead of us, particularly internationally.","Right now, I want to talk about how we run the company. There\u2019s five operating principles. One, we leverage brands. We have 12 brands that account for 80% of our revenues and profits. These are brands that consumers love.","Second thing, we\u2019ve long been a friend of the environment. And I\u2019m going to go into it a little deeper in a moment, and we leverage people. We have highly productive people in an environment, where people do matter.","And finally, we\u2019re asset-light. We leverage our assets. Now if you do those four things well, you\u2019re going to have really good returns. But because one of our competencies is identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses, we turn our good returns into great returns.","As I said, here are the brands. We have brands consumers love. As far as the friend of the environment goes, over 100 years ago, we started using recycled paperboard in our cartons. In the 1970s, we were the first and really only corporate sponsor for the first Earth Day. Actually 20 years later, in 1990, we\u2019re still the only corporate sponsor of Earth Day, and we were the first to take phosphates out of laundry detergent.","More recently, we\u2019ve been more focused on green global electricity demand supply by renewable sources by wind and power. And we\u2019ve been planting lots of trees with Arbor Day. And we all remember from fifth grade science, that trees take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and they turn into oxygen.","All right. What are some of our goals. We want to reduce water and wastewater by 25% by 2022. We want to recycle more. We want it 75% by the end of this year. And finally, we want to be carbon-neutral. So 100% carbon-neutral by 2025, and that\u2019s through having green electricity and also planting millions and millions of trees.","So that\u2019s our goal today. We\u2019re at 60% carbon-neutral. What that means is, we offset 60% of the CO2 that we put into the atmosphere. Okay. And we\u2019ve been getting some recognition for that as well. We\u2019ve regularly show up on list of Barron\u2019s, Forbes, the EPA list of companies that are faithful to the environment.","All right. Now I\u2019d just also mention highly productive people in a place where people matter. This is the statistic that is interesting. This is revenue per employee. So you can see, we\u2019re on the far right. We\u2019re over 900,000 right now on our way to $1 million per employee. And you can see where our peers are.","We think this is very representative of how lean the company is. And the thing that most people can\u2019t tell about any company we invest in is, what is the culture. And the culture in our company is as follows. And we talk about this both inside and outside the company. It\u2019s blue collar, high aptitude, underdogs. We\u2019re digitally savvy, we embrace diversity and we like taking risks.","And because we \u2013 that is the environment within our company. And you can\u2019t just snap your fingers, flip a light switch and create that. I didn\u2019t create that. That\u2019s been there for many, many years. It\u2019s the greatest asset of the company. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re so successful year-after-year-after-year.","Now, we have tremendous financial literacy within the company. Most companies will focus on revenue and EPS. We also focus on gross margin. And that\u2019s 25% of everyone\u2019s annual bonus. And when it\u2019s in your bonus, you ask questions like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s gross margin? And how can we get it, because it affects me.\u201d","And it\u2019s \u2013 so how we get it is, we have a Good to Great program, that\u2019s our continuous improvement program. We\u2019re continually optimizing our plants, new products are launched with higher gross margins than the products they replace. And when we buy businesses, we make them better. We expand the gross margins of businesses that we acquire.","We have very simple compensation structure. You can see on the left side of the pie, net revenue and EPS. On the right side, we focus on gross margin, which is uncommon, as a metric within incentive compensation program. And cash from operations, we\u2019ve long described ourselves as free cash flow junkies and we still are.","All right. I\u2019m going bring up Rick to talk about financials now.","Rick Dierker","All right. Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon. So we\u2019re going to go through three things. We\u2019re going to go through the 2019 results for the quarter, for the full-year and then go through the outlook.","And before we do that, we\u2019ll just start with Evergreen model, we \u2013 because we always do. 3% top line growth and 8% EPS growth. And then the drill down for that is 2% organic net sales growth, 25 basis points of gross margin expansion, flat on marketing as a percent, higher dollars typically with revenue growth. We leverage SG&A and we get to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and then 8% EPS growth. So that\u2019s the backdrop.","So how did we do? In Q4, you heard from Matt already, you saw in the release this morning, 4.4% organic revenue growth. Domestic was 3.5%, international was 10.5% and SPD for the first time in eight quarters with positive organic growth, which is great.","Adjusted gross margin was 170 basis points up. I\u2019ll walk through the detail of that in a minute. Marketing was up 240 basis points. So that\u2019s the highest spend rate we\u2019ve had in 2019. Just $37 million more year-over-year. It\u2019s a very significant increase. SG&A was up largely because of the acquisition. Our TSA agreement as well as the amortization with that deal.","Adjusted EPS was $0.55 versus the $0.54 outlook. So, on a revenue basis, the quarter was very strong, 4.4% and it was very strong even versus a strong year ago, 4.3%. So on a stacked basis, 8.7%. If you run your eyes across the page, 4.5% in the first quarter, 4.9% in the second, 3.5%, 4.4% and then 4.4% for the year.","So for the full-year, like I said, 4.4% domestic has a 4% in front of it, that\u2019s fantastic. As Britta said, 10 of 12 power brands grew share during the year. Internationally, just heard from Steve, 9% is a great number and then SPD was minus 3%.","Gross margin was up 110 basis points. I\u2019ll go through the detail gross margin in other slide. Marketing was up 10 basis points, that\u2019s greater than our outlook. And then adjusted SG&A was also up for the same reasons I talked about in the quarter.","EPS was up 9% to $2.47 and cash from operations was up to $865 million, up 16% year-over-year, just a fantastic result, higher cash earnings and improved working capital, which leads to free cash flow conversion of 128%, which is industry-leading, and we have a slide on that.","So gross margin, just to walk you through the puts and takes. In Q4, plus 60 basis points, so that\u2019s really the \u2013 we continue to get the benefit from price, as well as higher volumes. Inflation is a 50 basis point drag for the quarter, that has moderated a little bit since earlier in the year. Productivity programs are up 110 basis points. It\u2019s been pretty consistent for the whole year.","And then acquisition, so there\u2019s two parts of the acquisition, 50 basis points from owning FLAWLESS, 10 basis points is because they have a slightly higher gross margin in the company. The other 40 basis points is acquisition accounting. Remember we took that the revenue minus COGS, minus marketing, marketing profit, that\u2019s one line in net sales from the period of May through October. And so when there is no offset, it\u2019s a pure margin.","So gross margin expansion on a reported basis is 170 basis point. And then on a comparable basis, it would be 130 basis points. So that\u2019s the quarter. And for the full-year, many of the same things apply and comparable gross margin expansion is plus 70 basis points. So just a fantastic year. We raised gross margin, I think, three times throughout the year.","So on to 2020. So 6.5% reported sales growth, that\u2019s larger than 3.5% for organic plus the FLAWLESS impact. Domestic is a 3%, international 7% and SPD is 3%, that\u2019s our outlook for this year for the division. Gross margin is up 10 basis points. If you exclude or if you make 2019 comparable with the excluding the FLAWLESS accounting, we\u2019re up 50 basis points apples-to-apples.","Marketing is up 10 basis points. Again, we\u2019re investing incrementally behind these brands and behind these big launches you see on the table today, as well as FLAWLESS. SG&A, we\u2019re going to leverage by 10 basis points and operating margin on a reported basis is up 10 basis points, but apples-to-apples, up 50 basis points.","The effective tax rate is 21%. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 21%, for 2019, it was slightly below 21% and for 2020, we think it\u2019s 21%. What does that mean? It means all of our EPS growth is largely the operating income growth. EPS range from 7% to 9%, mid-point is 8% and then cash from ops is $890 million. So, as Matt talked about this year as a record, we would have a new record for next year.","Okay. So here are some details on the outlook. We start with our 8% Evergreen model, 8% plus 2% accretion for FLAWLESS. Tariffs is a minus 1% drag. We\u2019re getting a hit with tariffs 4B hitting FLAWLESS and our showerhead business to the tune of a drag of about 1% on EPS. Marketing investments for the new launch, that\u2019s the 10 basis points you guys saw on the earlier page. And so that\u2019s how we get to the mid-point of 7% to 9% and 8%.","We focused on gross margin for a long, long time, it\u2019s a hallmark of this company. Gross margin, as Matt said, is in everyone\u2019s bonus. Gross margin drives cash flow, cash flow drives valuation. So we had an inflection point of 44.4% in 2018, we recovered nicely in 2019 and we\u2019re going to continue to improve in 2020.","So in 2020, here are the details. Plus 80 basis points as we continue to get some benefits carryover from price and as well as higher volume. Inflation continues to be a drag of 150 basis point, that\u2019s largely pretty much across the Board from a commodity perspective.","I would say, commodities were flat to up, slightly up. Some examples for you, ethylene is up mid single digits, clay is up high single digits, we have PCR, resin as an example, which is high, up significantly. HDPE resin is flat. So we have some headwinds on inflation, tariffs are in that \u2013 is in that number as well.","Productivity programs are up 120 basis points, just getting very, very consistent with that. We\u2019ve done some great work on the supply chain. And then the acquisition kind of making that apples-to-apples again shows you how gross margin on a reported basis is plus 10 basis points, but plus 50 basis points when you say it\u2019s comparable.","Matt showed this slide earlier, organic sales growth, 10-year trend, 3.5%, which is fantastic. In 2020, our expectations are no different. 2019 was the first time since 2015 that we had a 3.5% outlook. And so we\u2019re proud to say that we\u2019re doing that, again, despite the pullback on private label and getting out of private label vitamins and a little bit of OXICLEAN laundry high promotion.","Okay. So just as important as volume, I mean, organic revenue growth is how we get there, right? So for the last 10 years, organic revenue growth was 3.5%, our volume growth on average is around 4%. You can see on the graph that we kind of inflected in 2019 and volume went down, right, and price mix went up.","And our outlook for 2020, 3.5% organic revenue growth, about 50-50 is going to come from volume versus price mix. Then marketing spend again is up 10 basis points. We\u2019re one of the top 20 advertisers within CPG. So we just have a significant amount of firepower here that we put to use for our brands.","And then SG&A, on a reported basis, it looks like it\u2019s gone up for the last few years. But when you strip out the acquisition, amortization, it\u2019s actually very flattish. So we\u2019re just really proud of this and 2020 is going to be no different. We expect to improve and leverage SG&A in 2020. We\u2019ve had consistent strong adjusted EPS growth, so high single-digit, double digits with tax reform and again, high single-digit in 2019 and 2020. So our range is 7% to 9%, mid-point is 8%, the peer average is about 1% to 2%.","This is my favorite Slide, best-in-class free cash flow conversion. We spend a lot of time on this, because we believe cash flow drives value and Church & Dwight in 2018 was 124% free cash flow conversion, that\u2019s free cash flow divided by net income, the peer average was 85%, a lot of companies target 90%.","Here is a new slide for you. Here\u2019s our history over time. 125% in 2015, 130% in 2016, 123% in 2017, 124% in 2018 and 128% is what we just finished out in 2019. Our outlook for 2020 is 119%. So we just believe this is what sets us apart from our peer group to play in the 80s, 90s or close to 100.","And how do we do that? Well, we do it a couple of different ways. One is really strong cash earnings. The second one is our improvement in working capital, cash conversion cycle. We\u2019ve gone from 52 days in 2009 all the way down to 18 days in 2020. If you strip out the last two acquisitions we\u2019ve done, this shows you how good we\u2019re doing it at really moving the needle in working capital, trying to get down to zero. That\u2019s still a goal.","So we\u2019ve gone \u2013 if you strip those two out, we\u2019re at seven days today. Our baseline changes, because we\u2019ve added these two new businesses that have a Chinese supply chain. So now we start off at 18 and we\u2019ll continue to work through that number. But you\u2019re going to see that we had great working capital improvement in 2019 and we expect no different in 2020.","And we have a very strong balance sheet. We ended the year, less than 2 times levered, 1.9 times, we expect by the end of 2020 to be about 1.5 times. We have significant financial capacity, right? When you\u2019re 1.5 times levered by the end of the year, you have the ability to do deals.","Our prioritized uses of free cash flow has been the same for many years. Number one is TSR-accretive M&A. Number two is TSR-accretive M&A, but debt reduction is number two, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to use the cash for this year. Number three is NPD, number four is CapEx for organic growth, and then number five is dividends or buybacks.","We\u2019re not a capital-intensive company. We\u2019re bumping up about $90 million next year and that\u2019s still less than 2% of sales. We have a great dividend increase in 2020, it\u2019s 5.5%. This is 119 years consecutively paying a dividend And then here is a new slide for you. Over the last three years, our average in the peer group for dividend annual growth rate was 8% and that\u2019s the top tier of all of our peer set.","And so with that, I\u2019ll invite the management team up and we\u2019ll answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","A - Matthew Farrell","Well, all the hands are up, hands not even up here yet. Okay, Nik.","Nik Modi","I finally beat someone taller than me. So I guess, two questions. I remember, I don\u2019t know, maybe it was 10 years ago, seven years ago, compaction was a pretty big deal for Church & Dwight from a margin perspective. So I was hoping to get some perspective from you on the new product launch and what that means for shipping costs and just packaging costs and how you think about that?","And then the second is, when it comes to FLAWLESS, I know there\u2019s kind of conflict right between the As Seen on TV and the merchandising aspect. And so just thinking longer-term, is there a plan to like completely migrate this to a in-store and digital and online product where you don\u2019t have that comp, because you guys have really execution, merchandising, display activity. So just \u2013 was hoping to get some clarity on the long-term plan there?","Matthew Farrell","Well, I\u2019ll take that one first. Yes, I mean the plan for FLAWLESS system migrated from As Seen on TV brand and completely into the wet shave aisle and completely vacate that part of the store. Because in a lot of stores, it\u2019s not in a very attractive place. So if you look at one major retailers by automotive. But when we bought it, we said no, this is a brand that\u2019s going to have legs at long-term and it belongs to wet shave aisle. And one major retailer is getting behind it right now. So over time, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see happening. It\u2019s happening right now in 2020.","Your other question was about compaction. So when compaction happen, there is one major retailer that drove that many, many years ago, that\u2019s not on the horizon right now for the industry. I mean, right now, one would argue that the biggest form of compaction is pods.","So that pods at some point \u2013 if pods at some point plateaus, I think, it\u2019s possible then we would go back to, it may be a major compaction for liquid laundry detergent, but that is clear enough on horizon right now. Were you asking the question about that new product\u2026","Nik Modi","Yes.","Matthew Farrell","\u2026that we have online. I\u2019ll let Britta take a swing at that one and what the insight was around that.","Britta Bomhard","So I think you\u2019re talking about the product I showed, that\u2019s an e-commerce play, right? So it\u2019s not in mass distribution, because I think I\u2019ve said that, and you\u2019ve seen our ambition to grow on the online class of trade, because that\u2019s where all the consumers go and a lot of shopping happens. And currently, there is not a good loan resolution there. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed this specific product for that class of trade, and we\u2019re seeing phenomenal results.","Nik Modi","Great. Thank you.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Bill?","Bill Chappell","Yes. Sticking on the laundry side, maybe first on CLEAN & SIMPLE. Can you give us a little more color. Is this incremental shelf space? How cannibalistic do you expect it to be? And then also, I mean \u2013 and maybe it\u2019s in the plans, there is not a pod form coming out, I guess on the initial launch. Well, it seems that Tide is coming at you with the Tide Simply version of pods.","So maybe the thought behind that of is, are you seeing pods in your category start to level out where it\u2019s not as important? Do you not see this as big of a threat? So any more color both around what the shelf space looks like and how you expect this to interact with the core brand and then also just from the pod standpoint, the competitive launch?","Matthew Farrell","Yes. So CLEAN \u2013 I\u2019ll let Paul comment at some point, but CLEAN & SIMPLE, whenever you launch a new product in liquid laundry under the ARM & HAMMER brand, you\u2019re going to have some cannibalization. But this one there will be some cannibalization, but net, it will be incremental to us and we think as well to the category.","As far as, are we going to move into pods for CLEAN & SIMPLE, we wouldn\u2019t disclose what our plans might be with respect to the CLEAN & SIMPLE as a platform. Could it happen? Absolutely. Bill, I\u2019ll let Paul comment as well some retailer reception to CLEAN & SIMPLE.","Paul Wood","Yes. I\u2019ll be a little guarded just in the message, more for competitive reasons than I\u2019m to avoid your question. But what I would tell you is, with every launch, we are going to have that cannibalization where you have the incrementality, absolutely. This one is a little different though, the story on this one of everything Britta showed in the marketing and the timing, what the consumers are looking for in the health and wellness front, just the other trends going on, makes us a very interesting story as you\u2019re pitching it to get incremental space, different space, display space, other things in the store.","I would tell you, it\u2019s happening as we speak right now, the resets, so I don\u2019t want to give away what others are doing. But I\u2019d encourage you the next couple of weeks to get out to a retail, loved to have retail with you and show you firsthand. This one is a little different.","I would also tell you on the insights front, we believe this isn\u2019t just looking at the consumer within our set today buying another yellow bottle. This is going to get some attention on shelf from maybe you\u2019re not buying it today. This is going to bring you in, the CLEAN & SIMPLE, the marketing grid has got behind it. You just saw fraction of it today. In the shopper marketing we\u2019re doing with retailer is going to be a little special. So I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m going to temper my vocabulary here, but love to talk to you more on this one.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Rupesh?","Rupesh Parikh","So I guess, just my first question with FLAWLESS, just curious what drove the shortfall in Q4. And as you look to this year, just want to get a sense, it seems like distribution is driving all the growth, just wanted to get a sense of velocity, the contributor. And then, also do you expect any inventory adjustments?","Matthew Farrell","Yes. So in the fourth quarter, we were down year-over-year. So business was $180 million in 2018, it was $186 million in 2019. We bought the business, we thought it would be higher by the end of the year. We know why \u2013 a couple of things we disclosed. We had an issue with one large retailer, Bed Bath & Beyond and we also delayed a launch into 2020.","Now as far as the consumption goes, consumption was down significantly in the fourth quarter. We expect that to continue, but to start to recover in the first quarter. And by the time we get to the second quarter, we\u2019re in the new launch and also the new distribution, we expect consumption in measured channels, because measured channels in this \u2013 for this category is less than 50%.","But you\u2019ll start to see in measured channels a year-over-year increase. And we think it\u2019s going to build from Q2, Q3 and Q4. So I think a lot of the growth is ahead of us starting in Q2 as a result of the NU RAZOR.","Rick Dierker","Yes. And I would just add to that. From an organic growth perspective, right, we\u2019re calling 50 basis points for tailwinds from FLAWLESS. In Q1, we think it will be flat to slightly down, and \u2013 but pretty much 90 basis points to 100 basis points of tailwind in the second-half and that\u2019s how you get to the 50 basis points for the full-year for organic.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. And then\u2026","Matthew Farrell","Do you have another one, Rupesh?","Rupesh Parikh","Yes. One quick one. So just in your guidance, what are you assuming for the promotional environment?","Matthew Farrell","Okay. So on the promotional environment, we\u2019ve talked about every quarter, and as many of you know the promotional environment generally talking about the household side of the house and not a personal care. And when we say household, it\u2019s about laundry and we\u2019re talking about litter. I\u2019ll take litter first. The litter category is pretty tame right now as far as the promotional environment. So if you look at sequentially, it was pretty much flattish and even year-over-year, there is no story there. So we think it\u2019s steady as you go in litter.","I think you got to keep in mind is that, in the litter category these hard fought price increases, it\u2019s unlikely that the suppliers are going to want to deal that, that the hard one increased back to the consumers. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change in 2020.","Laundry, same story. I mean, Q4 was our lowest quarter of the year, 25% sold on deal. And the category was 35%. And liquid laundry, little bit higher, it was 37% sold on deal. But two big suppliers would be Church & Dwight and Henkel both down sequentially from Q2, -- pardon me, Q3 to Q4. And Procter was up, it kind of filled the void in the promotional space. We expect that to continue in 2020. Okay. Your next. Yes.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Thank you. Just on the \u2013 sorry, 3.5% organic growth, like and you\u2019re exiting that you said is now out of the vitamin. So the vitamin business in private label, is that going to be \u2013 I\u2019m assuming that growth was more dilutive to your growth or \u2013 it was actually growing faster. So that 3.5% on a more continuing space is like a 4%, or is not \u2013 is small relative to make \u2013 to move the needle?","Matthew Farrell","Yes. I\u2019ll take a swing at this and then Rick can jump in. Yes. So we call it 3.5% for 2020. Our run rate in the second-half of 2019 as a company is 4%. We\u2019ve said, hey, that\u2019s going to accelerate by 50 basis points, because of FLAWLESS from 4% to 4.5%. So we have 100 basis points go in other way for two reasons. One, exiting private label vitamins and number two, we\u2019re continuing to pull back on OXICLEAN promotions.","Now with that 100 basis points, the lion\u2019s share of that is the vitamin business. We have stepped up our innovation over the last couple of years in vitamins. If you saw the Slide that we had earlier, you\u2019ll see \u2013 if you went back to 2016 and 2017, we had like six new launches a year, 2018 \u2013 from 2019, we had 22 new launches and next we\u2019re going to have 17 new launches. So \u2013 but this is the right time to exit our private label, it came into the company with the acquisition and it\u2019s lower margin and we think it\u2019s fine.","Rick Dierker","Yes. I would just add, that business was flattish, the private label business for vitamins, it wasn\u2019t declining or anything like that. We just felt that, that wasn\u2019t the right strategic choice for the company. So we decided to proactively get out of it.","Rupesh Parikh","And that is I think \u2013 that is accretive to margins, If I assuming right on exiting, to end that business or that\u2019s not?","Rick Dierker","It\u2019s \u2013 when you think about the scale and the size of that business, right, where \u2013 if we give you a sense of it, if we\u2019re saying 100 basis points is going down for those two things, maybe two-thirds of that is the private label and one-third of that is the laundry stuff. So, any impact on margin is pretty minimal.","Rupesh Parikh","And following up on Bill\u2019s question, if I may, on the CLEAN & SIMPLE, is that a margin accretive innovation or in the meantime you might have \u2013 like, what is the price point that you\u2019re positioning at this point?","Matthew Farrell","Hey, Paul, do you want to take a swing at the price points?","Paul Wood","Yes. So the price points, this is going to be right in line with our existing lineup. So just as Britta was talking about the efficacy and it being equal, that\u2019s how it will show up for shelf as well. And that\u2019s a really big message that our retailers really resonated with them that it was going to be line-priced.","Rick Dierker","And then from a margin basis, we wouldn\u2019t really say much, but it\u2019s at brand average. Year one we have, of course, cost to drive volume for incrementality.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Joe?","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Just wanted to get a bit more color on the increase in marketing spend, obviously a big in the fourth quarter, and it sounds like you\u2019re looking for about a 1 point of headwind on EPS growth in 2020. What\u2019s driving the increase? Is it bigger new launches and what particular brands is it going behind and are you shifting dollars away from promo into marketing?","Matthew Farrell","Is the question with respect to fourth quarter?","Joe Altobello","Fourth quarter and 2020 as well?","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Well, fourth quarter, we could see what was coming and we are doing well on top line and gross margin. So we have a chance to reinvest both in marketing and in SG&A. We call that all places we invested in SG&A. So obviously, we\u2019re able to throw a lot of money behind on the brands. That \u2013 and that always helps you going into the new year. As your question about 2020, is the 10 basis points uptick?","Joe Altobello","Yes. More so that the 1 point of EPS headwind that you\u2019re expecting to from launches?","Rick Dierker","The 10 basis points does represent the 1% EPS drag and it\u2019s really for the new launches, right. The one on the table, we\u2019ll really get behind that in a big way. The NU RAZOR for FLAWLESS get behind that in a big way. And then maybe, Britta, if you want to talk about.","Britta Bomhard","Yes. So we have a couple of exciting product, as you saw. So, for example, BATISTE foam, we are category leader and as you\u2019ve seen, there is a huge household penetration opportunity, it\u2019s also a new hair type. So we\u2019re going to spend some money on educating consumers about a new way, particularly women with curly and dry hair.","Matthew Farrell","And maybe one more I had, I just thought of is, we showed you household penetration for WATERPIK in the U.S. versus internationally, and we found that it\u2019s very responsive to advertising. And so now we\u2019re going to start rolling that out in Europe and Canada and Australia. So that marketing investment is happening globally as well.","Joe Altobello","And just one for Steve. The increase in operating margin for international this year is pretty big. Is that coming from sales leverage among other things or cost savings programs? What\u2019s driving that?","Steven Cugine","Yes. So I think there\u2019s a couple of things. We had some expense in the year that we\u2019re not going to recover. We feel like we\u2019ve made investments on top of that, that we\u2019re not going to repeat again in next year. I would say, that\u2019s a large part of that and there is some mix as well.","Joe Altobello","Okay. Thanks.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Steve?","Stephen Powers","Okay. I do have a question for Steve. But something Rick said earlier prompted another question. Why would FLAWLESS have any impact on organic regardless of what it does in the first quarter, given that you didn\u2019t owner it a year ago?","Rick Dierker","It doesn\u2019t. I was trying to give you a sense that on a reported basis in Q1, that it could be flat to down. The organic impact is 50 basis points for the full-year. All of that\u2019s in the second-half, around 100 basis points.","Stephen Powers","Okay, perfect. And then internationally, maybe you could get a lot going on, but maybe you could rank order, the growth initiatives you have on top three, whether you think about it by brand, by geography or by category? And then as you think forward with the commitments or margin expansion as an evergreen, does that inhibit your ability to kind of press on growth as you have been or should we expect some deceleration back down toward that Evergreen\u2019s six-ish level?","Steven Cugine","No, we feel really confident, I mean we see the business accelerating as you saw in 2019, and we see that continuing into 2020, again with less requirement for investments. Because we think we have the right kind of staffing level in each one of the regions, China was a big investment over the last couple of years, as we\u2019ve built our own team in China plus we spent money on slotting, getting product into that market.","So we think all of that, whether it would be Latin America, which has been growing very nicely for us and in Asia-Pac, whether it would be China or Southeast Asia, we\u2019ve made a lot of investments in the past. And now we think we can reap the benefits of continued strong organic growth without those investments repeating. That\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s why we feel, so confident that we can continue to deliver on the operating margin, because we\u2019re going to get leverage in the P&L. So we\u2019re going to get that on marketing and we\u2019re going to get that on SG&A, for sure.","Stephen Powers","It is the growth investment skewed anywhere, I mean are you more excited about emerging markets about...","Steven Cugine","You know it\u2019s a funny thing, and [indiscernible] is here. He runs our GMG business and he would say this year, we had strong growth in EMEA and in Latin America. Latin America is smaller for us, but fast growing. We made those investments in China, we saw very strong China growth in 2019 and we expect strong growth in Southeast Asia as well. Asia, in particular, we see is real growth engine long-term for the company, because we\u2019re just still young and small, but growing fast.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. Swing to this side of the table, Kevin?","Kevin Grundy","All right. Kevin Grundy, Jefferies. I had a question on international as well. So it works out. So connecting the dots just to sort of pick up where you left off there, Steve, given that why the implied deceleration in the outlook for international and I don\u2019t want to diminish 7%, which is outstanding. But you guys haven\u2019t done a 7% in the past five years in the region and now you have a presence in China.","So I\u2019m just trying to to connect the dots with that. And then more broadly, maybe, Matt, you can chime in the role on M&A and how you potentially see that longer- and growing your international business.","And lastly, from a capital planning perspective, when do certain markets you potentially consider moving them from the export model to the subsidiary model? What\u2019s sort of like a tipping point? How do you think about that and implications from an income statement and from balance sheet perspective? Thanks.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. I\u2019ll try to remember all that. Let\u2019s start off with the current year. So, we have an algorithm of 6% annually. So we always go back to that, can we sustain 6% year-after-year-after-year. And if you look at what Steve has been doing in international is hitting out of the park.","And so, now we got a big plan for this year, you might say you\u2019re sad because it\u2019s not 9%, but we\u2019re not a company that\u2019s going to get way out over our skis. So we think we got a strong plan for 2020. We don\u2019t view that as a deceleration, we look at that as we\u2019re consistently now delivering above our algorithm.","You asked the question about international. So we have done some M&A internationally over the past few years. Viviscal was a \u2013 is an international brand. Our WATERPIK had some international as well. We bought the ANUSOL brand from J&J. And so we\u2019re putting a lot of effort behind those and we get a lot of traction.","So Steve and his gang have done a great job, taking those two to international markets. So we\u2019re continually scanning for things that we can acquire, and we can put into our infrastructure and leverage it. But we\u2019re pretty fussy about what we\u2019re going to buy. And as you know, you had a third one though, the third question.","Kevin Grundy","Yes, when does it tip to go direct?","Matthew Farrell","Yes. Okay, I\u2019ll go \u2013 Steve can say what we\u2019ve done in Germany.","Steven Cugine","Yes. So we look at markets where we can go direct and it really is all about SG&A leverage. So how concentrated is the retail environment. And in Germany, it\u2019s quite concentrated. So, we were able to go direct in Germany and manage that P&L, so we get returns fast. My two buddies down here, they\u2019re pretty disciplined about spending and returns, as you can imagine.","So you really need like a 20 to 1 relationship in terms of SG&A investment to sales growth. And so where the markets are young and highly fragmented from a retail environment, it takes a lot more SG&A to make that happen. So we know the underlying economic model for us, what we need to have to shift from an export market to a subsidiary market. And we\u2019ll make those calls as we see fit, but that is not required for us to hit our evergreen target.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. All right. Same table, Jason.","Jason English","Good afternoon, and thank you. Two very different topics for questions. First, sticking on international, but with a supply chain angle. Can you update us on the status of tariffs on your supply chain and also whether or not we should be considering any risk related to the coronavirus in terms of supply and manufacturing of \u2013 whether it\u2019d be the WATERPIK or I\u2019m not sure where FLAWLESS is manufactured whether we should be cognizant of that as well?","Second is on private label. Could you size of 100 bps drag, how much of it is from the private label exit, any reason to think that may actually suck some capacity out of the industry and help your branded side? And is there also maybe on the other side of that, risk presumably a good time to exit would have been five years ago when you\u2019re spending a lot of money to add capacity, I imagine you chose not to, because of, there was a risk tethered to it. If assuming that\u2019s the case then why is that there no longer that risk?","Matthew Farrell","I\u2019ll start with China. So we\u2019re well aware of what\u2019s going on in China, right now with the virus. So we have checked with our suppliers of both of finished products and also business like FLAWLESS and SPINBRUSH and WATERPIK. And right now, it looks like because of the extension of the Chinese New Year, there is going to be a one, maybe two-week delay in startup of those manufacturing sites. But because of our safety stock what\u2019s on the water and also, you can overcome some of delay like that with air freight, that we don\u2019t see a risk right now with what we know right now to quarter call that\u2019s in the \u2013 it\u2019s in the release. Good on that one?","Steven Cugine","Yes. And then on tariffs I would I try to talk about in my prepared remarks, a little bit. But that 1% drag on EPS is tariffs that\u2019s really the four B list that went into effect on December 15, and we\u2019re getting hit on showerheads and FLAWLESS. So you can do the math on what about 1% EPS drag is, but it\u2019s a couple of cents.","And then your other question on private label vitamins of 100 basis points decline in organic growth, I had said about 60% is piece of the private-label vitamin beginning to exit, right? It\u2019s a two-year process. So 50 bps of the 100 bps is from private-label vitamins. And I don\u2019t know, Rick, if you want to say anything else about the supply chain in China or are you good?","Rick Dierker","Yes. Matt pretty much covered it. We\u2019re working very closely with our suppliers. And what we know so far is the one to two-week delay that Matt referenced on starting up after Chinese New Year. We have ample safety stock don\u2019t anticipate a material impact to Q1, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to monitor on a regular basis.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. All right. Okay. You\u2019ve been waving your hand for a while.","Stephen Powers","Thanks, Matt. Wanted to talk about two different categories and just state of competition in laundry and cat litter, and then also your expectations for fiscal \u201820 between volume versus price mix?","Matthew Farrell","I couldn\u2019t hear the very first part of it.","Stephen Powers","Laundry and cat litter, the state of competition.","Matthew Farrell","Oh, the state of competition in the laundry and litter category? Okay. Well, I mean you saw the chart with respect to shares in laundry. We had a great year in laundry. ARM & HAMMER was up. XTRA, for the first time in a longtime held share up a little bit. And OXICLEAN, we lost some share, but that was as not as expected because we pulled back on promotions.","You also saw from the chart the dynamics over the last three years, but who is winning and who is struggling. We think we have an unfair competitive advantage in the laundry detergent, because we have a value brand, that\u2019s advertised, which is ARM & HAMMER. And ARM & HAMMER is $1 billion brand if you go across all of our categories. And actually we\u2019ve done a wonderful job in positioning that product against Sun over the last couple of years and we continue to win distribution.","So we\u2019ve got a long-term plan and we aim to be the number two supplier of laundry detergent at some point. In the litter category, litter is a function of innovation and we have been the innovator in that category for many, many years. And we think that over time that is going to bode well for us as far as growing share in the future.","I commented earlier about the promotional environment, it is pretty much \u2013 pretty tepid, I would say, in both categories. I don\u2019t expect that to change in litter as we said, because we\u2019re not going to deal back your price increases. And I do think that the reduction in the amount sold on deal in the laundry category is really de facto price increase, we want list price increases in laundry. But the pull back in promotions as a group over time is de facto an increase in price and it improves margins.","Steven Cugine","And Matt, if you want me talk about just how we advertise Oxi Laundry and what\u2019s this done to the additives category?","Matthew Farrell","You can do that.","Steven Cugine","Well, sometimes myopically we just look at, Oxi Laundry is down a little bit in share, but we really didn\u2019t take a broader brush and say since we launched OXICLEAN laundry, we\u2019ve gone from a 42 share in additive to 56 share in additives. So we\u2019re really happy with our OXICLEAN megabrand.","Matthew Farrell","I hope everybody paid attention to that. So if you go back and say, wow, OXICLEAN launched into premium laundry detergent and we\u2019re sad because it didn\u2019t work out. No. So in stain fighters, we had a 42% market share when we launched OXICLEAN over in liquid laundry, it went from 42% to 56% today. So all that effort paid off, and so we\u2019re making a lot more money today. So that brand is alive and well.","Britta Bomhard","Can I add something. So you see\u2026","Matthew Farrell","Let\u2019s pile on here. This is good.","Britta Bomhard","Sorry?","Matthew Farrell","Let\u2019s pile on.","Britta Bomhard","Yes, well, I love that brand. So I have to talk about brands. And I think you\u2019ve seen the more power to you and what it does for us. We now have a similar and that\u2019s work your magic on OXICLEAN, which is equally working extremely well across the different components of OXICLEAN. So if we have several very clear evidence the lifts after we advertise and then it\u2019s across the different sub-segments of OXICLEAN as well. So I\u2019m very confident, positive that OXICLEAN is a very, very strong brand and we continue to grow.","Matthew Farrell","Okay. All right. It looks like we might be done. Hey, I want to thank everybody for coming today. We had great questions and looking forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter."],"5198":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

LLC","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Dierker. Rick will comment on each of our businesses and review the outlook for Q3 and the full year. And when Rick is finished, I'll get back on and we'll open the call up for questions.","So here are the highlights; Q2 was a terrific quarter for our company. We posted organic sales growth of 3.7% and 16.4% EPS growth, which is 17.8% EPS growth on a currency neutral basis. Category growth was broad-based, in that nine of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective four of our 10 power brands grew share.","Now I'll comment on a few of our categories; that would be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 2.5% year-over-year. This is the fifth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 4%, led by ARM & HAMMER, Simply Tide and Sun, mid and premium tier segments grew slower than the category. The Laundry category growth was driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments.","Now I'll comment on our three laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years. ARM & HAMMER laundry share continued to grow this quarter, up 10 basis points. To illustrate the consistency of the brand, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 26 consecutive quarters.","Our unit dose products are gaining traction. ARM & HAMMER unit dose in the quarter grew twice the unit dose category growth rate. Our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Growth was equally driven by base and promoted volume signaling a healthy balance.","These are encouraging signs and we are really pleased with the results. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 40 basis points to a 3% share in the quarter. Our XTRA brand lost share in the quarter as we continue to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q1, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to increase year-over-year for full-year 2016.","OXI laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year as we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity and increased distribution. As we have said before, we are committed to OXI laundry detergent and are in this for the long haul.","As you know, Henkel has plans to acquire the Sun Products company, which owns all, Wisk and Snuggle brands and competes in private label. It's too early to know the impact on the category. There are two obvious schools of thought; we may experience a disciplined competitor who competes with innovation, or the laundry category could see even more discounting. We'll have to just wait and see. Regardless of what happens, we believe our brands are important to consumers. Consumer insights leading to the right products, at the right price point will be our formula for success.","Moving on to stain fighters, OXICLEAN is the leading stain fighter in the additive category. This is the second consecutive quarter that OXICLEAN share hit a 48% share, growing 2% versus last year.","Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment is healthy with consumption growth of 4.5%. Q2 saw a significant increase in the amount sold on deal by competitors, notably Clorox and Tidy Cat. At the same time, our amount sold on deal was significantly lower than the prior year, resulting in a pullback in share.","In the end, innovation carries the day, we are very pleased with the performance of our new premium priced CLUMP & SEAL MICROGUARD. And while we're on the topic of innovation, I would like to acknowledge that ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL litter received the prestigious 2016 Nielsen Innovation Award for food and household products. CLUMP & SEAL was selected from a field of 3,500 new product launches over a two year period. Innovation is the key to long-term organic growth and we continue to focus on litter innovation.","Now, let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The gummy segment of VMS grew at 15% in Q2. Let me break that down for you, the adult gummy segment grew 21%, while the kids gummy segment declined 4%.","So vitamins is a good news story for us. Both VITAFUSION and little L'il Critters grew in the quarter. VITAFUSION adult gummy consumption grew 9% and L'il Critters children's gummy also recorded positive growth of 40 basis points. Most notable, our combined points of distribution for our vitamin business grew 5% year-on-year, reflecting continued distribution gains.","Our strong quarter was the result of new item introductions, expanded distribution of existing SKUs and the quality issues that we experienced last year are behind us. In adult and children's gummy vitamins category, VITAFUSION and L'il Critters are the number one brands, with shares of 31% and 32% respectively.","Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. Remember when we bought the business, out of the entire adult VMS category, only 3% was in the gummy form. Today, it is 9%.","The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 28% in Q2 after growing 26% in Q1. The category in the U.S. is now nearly $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category, if we match the historical category growth experienced in the UK where the product originated.","BATISTE is the number one brand in the U.S. with a 22.3% share. BATISTE was the fastest growing brand in the category and BATISTE original dry shampoo is now the fastest turning SKU in the category. BATISTE global net sales will cross $100 million this year for us, making it the number one dry shampoo brand globally and the BATISTE brand is expected to be one of our fastest-growing brands in the future.","Next up is Rick to give you details of our second quarter results and the outlook for Q3 and the full year.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share, compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat. Netted in that $0.85 is a penny or a 1.4% drag from currency year-over-year.","Reported revenues were up 3.6% to $877 million, organic sales were 3.7%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. Our organic sales beat was driven by our Consumer business, both Domestic and International. This may surprise some of you who track our consumption reports every few weeks, the Nielsen and IRI numbers are a barometer of consumption growth, the difference is unmeasured channels. I want to remind everyone about our strength in club and the growing strength of our online business. For example, you read in the release that online sales for our vitamin business doubled. So third-party consumption reporting is directional but doesn't give the whole picture.","Now, let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 4.4% driven by VITAFUSION Gummy Vitamins, Batiste Dry Shampoo, OXICLEAN additives and partially offset by KABOOM cleaners. We continue to expect full-year organic sales to be approximately 3% for the Domestic business.","International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by higher sales in Australia, Mexico and Canada. We are raising our expectation for the full-year organic growth from approximately 5% to 6% to approximately 7% to 8% for the International business.","For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were down 7.7%. Milk prices are still relatively low as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been around 15% plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We are lowering our expectations for the full-year for the SPD division to be down 4% to 5%. We like this business but we do experience these cycles from time to time.","Turning now to gross margin, our reported second quarter gross margin was 46.5%, a 250 basis point increase from a year ago, which was quite a bit better than we originally expected, largely due to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies and higher Personal Care sales.","Since we spent quite a bit of time last quarter on gross margin, I'd like to breakout the detail now for the quarter improvement versus year ago. I will do the same thing for our full-year gross margin outlook in a few minutes. Q2 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 70 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, which include the absence of vitamin startup cost, together is worth 130 basis points. Price volume mix is worth 60 basis points, as we had higher Personal Care organic sales, up almost 8% versus a year ago. And in general, we had a low level of promotion across the portfolio. Finally, we had 20 basis points from the higher margin acquired businesses offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency.","Moving to marketing, we increased marketing spend by 3.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of revenue was consistent with 2015 at 13.7%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.8%, an 80 basis point decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. Remember in 2015 we had a pension settlement charge of $8.9 million, so on an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 30 basis points, in line with our full year expectations.","Now to operating profit, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 20%, which is 320 basis points higher than the prior year on a reported basis and 220 basis points better on an adjusted basis, largely driven by the gross margin improvement. Other expense was $6.8 million for the quarter.","Next our income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%, we are raising our effective tax rate forecast for the full year to 35%, largely due to geographic mix. So there is a bigger drag from tax.","Turning to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. So on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $297 million of cash from operations, which is a $48 million increase from the same period a year ago.","So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include 3.7% organic, 16.4% EPS growth, which again equate to a 17.8% currency neutral EPS growth.","Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%, behind stronger promotions and slower growth for our International and SPD divisions. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to increase, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales, as we begin to spend back our gross margin expansion.","We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.92, compared to $0.90 per share a year ago, or a 2% increase year-over-year, which reflects the step up in marketing, the higher promotional activities, slightly higher SG&A due to incentive comp and a higher tax rate.","And now, turning to the full year. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be 3% to 4%, which has been increased from 3% when we started the year. We posted 4.4% organic growth in the first half. And in the second half, as we plan to spend back a bit more on promotional activities, it results in lower second half organic sales growth. We will likely end up in the middle of the range.","In May, we called approximately 75 basis points of gross margin expansion. And we are pleased to say that we are raising our outlook to 110 basis points of expansion. We can attribute this increase to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies offset by incremental promotional activities.","I'd like to break out the detail now for the full year gross margin outlook versus year ago. For the full year, gross margin benefits from lower commodities and that's worth 60 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs including the absence of vitamin startup costs is worth 50 basis points. Price volume mix is worth 10 basis points as we invest a bit more in higher promotions in the back half. And finally, we forecast 20 basis points from the higher margin acquired businesses offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency. We are increasing our full year marketing expectation by 10 basis points to 12.4%, as we spend back some of the gross margin beat.","Moving to SG&A, adjusting for the 2015 pension settlement charge, we are now forecasted to increase by 40 basis points. We had previously called 25 basis points for the increase. The higher SG&A rate is due to significantly higher medical cost and higher incentive comp. So now we expect 60 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year.","Next is income tax. As I mentioned before, we now expect 35% for the full year, so it's about 30 basis points greater than our previous outlook. In terms of EPS, we dropped the low end of the range and are now targeting 8% to 9% of adjusted EPS growth, despite the incremental spending on marketing and promotion as well as the higher tax rate.","We now expect $640 million of operating cash flow, which is $10 million better than our previous outlook of $630 million. We continue to expect $55 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $585 million of free cash flow, which represents 125%-plus of free cash flow conversion.","Wrapping up, as you read in our earnings release today, we also announced a two-for-one stock split of our common stock. The split will increase our total shares outstanding from approximately 128.8 million to 257.6 million shares.","Now, Matt and I will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Matt, I wanted to start, or Rick as well for that matter, on the guidance. So, organic sales stays the same, gross margins a bit better. But, Matt, it seems like but \u2013 and then advertising and marketing moves up more modestly, so it seems like you're probably leaning a bit harder on trade spend and coupon with some of this gross margin upside relative to taking up advertising and marketing. Is that correct? I just wanted to get some additional thoughts on how you're sort of balancing the trade spend in advertising and marketing?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Matt and I can both answer that. But, Kevin, from a financial perspective, I'd say it's pretty broad based. We have higher promotional spending. Yes, we also have higher advertising. So, I think it's a combination. And, that's kind of the \u2013 again, broad-based across advertising and promotional spending.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hey, Kevin, just to give you maybe a little more color. In my remarks, I said, hey, there's a lot of discounting going on in laundry and litter. And litter for example, we actually pulled back on trade promotions year-over-year in Q2 while at the same time, if you looked at Tidy Cat or Fresh Step they were up significantly in Q2. And even in laundry, the amount sold on deal for ARM & HAMMER was actually lower year-over-year in Q2, whereas if you looked at Tide, Simply Tide or Sun or especially Purex, are way up in the amount sold on deal year-over-year. So, every quarter is different. So you got to react to what's going in the marketplace and as I said, we're \u2013 we want to stay behind OXICLEAN, OXICLEAN laundry so, we're in it for long-haul there.","And here and there in some other categories there's some competitive moves that we need to react to. So, fortunately, we have the financial flexibility in order to do that and as you know, we got a big portfolio of brands. So, we're in a position where we need some help, we're going to put the help there.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. All right. That makes sense. Rick, I wanted to come back to, you touched on it a little bit, some of the non-scanned channel growth versus the scanned or tracked channel growth and so, you are up about 0.5 point in the Nielsen data for the second quarter. That implies very strong double-digit growth in non-tracked, just using sort of back of the napkin sort of math based on reasonable assumptions for channel mix.","So, can you guys help me a bit, what is online now as a percent of sales and understanding that club is not in the Nielsen data as well, but curious what that number is, if you care to share it, what are your market shares look like online versus non-tracked? Procter talks about having higher market share in the online channel relative to more traditional mass channels.","And then Matt, maybe touch on a little bit as this continues to evolve and the consumer continues to move online, talk about the implications a bit for your business from a \u2013 even broadly, margin perspective, seemingly less trade spend at this point et cetera? Thank you.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, Kevin, just to touch briefly, we don't really go into the detail of our online sales. We've said historically, it's 1% to 3% of sales, just like any other CPG company, that's true, I'd say it's fast growing. From a market share perspective, we don't really comment on that either.","What I will do for you though is help you with the tracked versus not-tracked and there is two or three drivers on that disconnect. For example, there's probably around 200 basis points from club and online, plus the fact that BATISTE isn't really tracked in Nielsen data from the reports you guys get.","There is also a disconnect when you don't spend on promotion. So for example XTRA, consumption is down 6%, our net sales is essentially flat because we're not spending as deeper on promotion, same thing with Spinbrush, which we talked about before as well, we're up 10% consumption, net sales were up 15%. So when you're trying to bridge consumption all the way back to organic, those are a couple of the reasons why and I'll turn it back over to Matt for online.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, just broadly as Rick said, that most consumer products companies have sales between 1% and 3% online and online is actually not as clear as you might think in order to determine shares, because you got Amazon, walmart.com, target.com, there is lots of places where we want our product to be available and the whole game is, you want your product to be ubiquitous, right, it needs to be wherever a consumer wants to find it. So we're looking at this as just another class of trade. We have a convergence going on between research and advertising, right? So a lot of the research now, a lot of consumer behavior research is digital, it's online. At the same time a lot of the advertising is online. So we understand that, so we're weaving both our advertising and our research efforts together as a result.","It's the early innings for everybody and everybody has got to look at do we have the right pack sizes for online. You're going to have different packs online than you have in the store just to take the weight out. We always look at change as our friend, because we're a small company. So we think that we can react to change a lot faster than other companies. So we're kind of looking forward to competing online.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. The organic growth guidance for the third quarter, was there a timing shift in shipments at all or is it merely a function of higher promotional spending which is going to take the gross to net down? Because the comp's much easier in the third quarter than the second quarter obviously.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think it's a couple things. I mean, what you're getting to is also just deceleration from first half to second half. But the incremental promotional spending, right, that's one. We're up against higher comps for vitamin, like for example our Personal Care growth was up big in Q2, up 8% organically. And for vitamins we were cutting a year ago in Q2 and that kind of lessened as we got in the back half. And then, category comps for laundry for example are up a little bit in the back half, and then International growth, the first half was at 10% and the full year is at 7% to 8%. So that implies a second half of 4% to 5%. So all those reasons are why we're decelerating a little bit. But, I'd say that's \u2013 our original outlook was 3%, we always thought it would be, we raised that at the beginning of the year to 3% to 4%. And we always knew it was going to be a little bit lumpy.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I mean, but how about the comps being harder in this quarter than they are for next quarter. I mean, because all that stuff is good, but like in aggregate the comp's like 200 basis points easier than the comp in the second quarter. You know what I mean?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Well, I mean, the other comment I'd make is the laundry category \u2013 going back to the category dynamics for a second, if you go back to 2015, the laundry category was actually down in Q1, right. And in 2016, the laundry category was up in Q1. So on a stacked basis that was around 5%.","In Q2, it's around 4%. But then, when you look out, the laundry category actually had 2% to 3%, almost 4% growth in the back half of the year in 2015. So, part of it is, like I said before, Household comparisons for laundry and then Personal Care, really vitamins going from Q2 to the back half is a more difficult comp.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just directionally, is it fair to think that like the Personal Care business has 20 gross margin points higher than the Household business. Is that a safe assumption, as I try to calculate the mix impact of the business shift?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We've said that publicly before. We said Personal Care margins are about 2000 basis points better than Household.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got you. And I'm kind of surprised that the mix benefit wasn't more though, given like the lower promotions in the lowest margin categories like XTRA and cat litter?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We were very pleased with 250 basis points of expansion.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, was I. Okay. That's all I got. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, just wanted to clarify. As I look forward, as you're spending back in some of these brands, has that always kind of been in the plan of hey, we just kind of get to midyear and look to redeploy in certain areas? And then specifically, is what you're seeing in liquid laundry in terms of the price competition or some of the rollbacks what you expected or has competition heated up a little bit?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know if it's \u2013 I'd say competition has heated up because the amount sold on deal. It's certainly higher than it was year-over-year. Sequentially it's probably consistent with the first quarter. The way we run the business, Bill, is we put a range out there, 7% to 9%. So we're pretty much targeting the midpoint of a range generally. We get a great first half, so we say, hey, we don't see our way to 7%. So we're going to say \u2013 so we're going to take the bottom in the range off so we'll call 8% to 9%. And we don't try to hit the home run in any one year. We're always thinking about the next year. So we want to make sure we're positioned well going into next year. So to the extent we have the dough, we're going to spend it back. And this has been a perennial move on the part of Church & Dwight.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","No. I appreciate that. I think I have a pretty decent handle on the trends. But I was trying to kind of more understand as you look to the back half, I understand the strategy of spending back. But, is there an incremental need to spend back in liquid laundry and\/or cat litter versus what kind of you originally expected to start the year?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Because we \u2013 I would say that because we pulled back as a percentage of sales on deal for litter in the second quarter. Actually that's something we would try to remedy in the back half. Because obviously we lost some share there. But we \u2013 share can be a saw tooth, it can go up and down. But I will say that it's definitely competitive in litter. You have both Tidy Cat and Clorox spending a lot of dough promoting their products. So obviously we have to react to that. But laundry is our biggest category and that's one we're also have to react. XTRA continues to lose share, we're managing that for profit. But there is a line that we won't cross. So we have to make sure we shore that up in the second half.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just switching, Rick, I think you talked about the Nielsen IRI doesn't track your stuff perfectly, I mean, I understand that especially coming from vitamins, which kind of were \u2013 the business was built out of club and mass, but can you talk about other wins or other kind of growth you're seeing outside of vitamins in the club channel or the online channel and where you feel pretty good about?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean other online brand that's very strong is TROJAN for example. That helped lead to the Personal Care organic growth in Q2. Across the board, oral care has been pretty strong as well and that's happening in club, online. Those are two examples, but again it's \u2013 we don't get all riled up about the tracked versus non-tracked, it's \u2013 a piece of it is, although the whole concept of promotional volume and not chasing that promotional volume, that causes a little bit of a disconnect between organic and consumption.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And, Bill, as you know, Personal Care products lend themselves more to online sales than the heavy litter and detergent products.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks so much.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Your line is open.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks so much. Just if you could talk a little more in detail on the share movement. So I know you've touched on some of this already, but I guess six of 10 categories, you didn't gain share, which is unusual. Were some of those flat, and then what are the plans across the board to turn those around for the things you haven't talked about yet?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. Well, the four that were up were OXI stain fighters, Nair, BATISTE and vitamins. So the other ones we might talk about, Spinbrush for example, that category, battery-operated toothbrushes, was up 9.5%. Our adult toothbrush was up 10% but kids was soft. So, sort of a balance there, it's where we fell back.","XTRA, we talked about. Obviously deep discounting there, particularly on the part of Sun products and some Simply Tide as well. Orajel, the issue there was private label had a good quarter. Condoms, that kind of ebbs and flows, so we generally don't worry too much about the condom share because we have approximately 75% share in that category.","FIRST RESPONSE through, there has been a lot of couponing and competition that we have to address. Some of that by the way for the earlier questions is pregnancy kits is also an area that we're putting some money behind in the second half because we lost some share as a result of competition in the second quarter.","And the ARM & HAMMER brand in total all forms was down, driven by litter. It was down slightly, all forms about 10 basis points, but it was really litter that was the driver there. So, that's sort of the rundown on the 10 brands, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Right. And does that \u2013 is that why you're getting more aggressive. Was that really driving the change, or is it simply you have the money to spend. Because, I mean, you generally love to claim that on almost all of your categories you're gaining share. So, is that the goal by year end? You want to up in all categories?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No, it's \u2013 look, when we say four out of 10 it's not like we're unhappy. I don't think we've ever had a 10 out of a 10 quarter, I think six would be great, six out of 10. And if the rest were around flattish. So yeah, I mean, some of them are \u2013 there are clearly issues in each of those different brands, but we expect to remedy them in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And then could you just comment on the UK, which I think is your biggest international market, maybe Canada is. Sorry, but how are things there?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So think of it, it's not just the UK. We have a European business that's our number one subsidiary followed by Canada, which is number two. Europe would encompass primarily the UK and France. And they've been doing fabulously behind BATISTE, certainly is their biggest brand. But they also have STERIMAR, which is a feminine hygiene brand and \u2013 or pardon me, Femfresh is a feminine hygiene brand, and then STERIMAR which is our nasal hygiene brand. So they've been doing extremely well.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Because you didn't call out the UK and you usually do, so I just thought that maybe there were some issues already showing up?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no, no. No issues, it's just that we have the league table. So the ones that are at the top of the league table in the quarter get to take a bow.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And then lastly just on your margin profile online, is there any degradation of margin as you build up that business?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Actually some of the products that we sell online can be higher margin than they are in bricks-and-mortar. So it's a balance right now. We're pretty happy with the margins online. I think the heavier products like litter is where we'd be more pressed on margin. They would be lower than anything we would have in bricks-and-mortar.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, but overall, even online, the Personal Care mix is slanted toward Personal Care, so that helps the margin as well. So we're happy with that.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks a lot.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Caroline.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I guess, I'll just pick up there on the gross margin guide and I apologize if I missed this, was mix the biggest driver of the upside to the full year?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","To the full year? I would probably say, partly mix but also because of the organic revenue growth on Personal Care. But I'd also say, we were pleasantly surprised as we turned the corner on our vitamin manufacturing and our vitamin distribution efficiencies. A year ago when we were cutting customers, the trucks were going out every day and they weren't always filled, because we wanted to get that next shipment to the retailer as soon as possible. When we look back this quarter for example, our fill rate's closer to 99%. So we're shipping out full truckloads again. So that's as an example of what's going on with gross margin.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the third quarter, the organic up 1% to 2%. If you look at your volume growth the last few quarters, it's kind of averaged somewhere between 3% and 4%. So maybe if you could deconstruct for us what you're thinking in terms of volumes versus price mix in the third quarter, is it volumes up 2% to 3%, call it, maybe price mix down 1%?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Joe, I think, you are very familiar with the story. And we've been a perennial volume company. I think this past quarter we had some positive price mix as well and that was because we had lower promotions. It was \u2013 but I'd say for the go-forward, it's typically always volume. So that's how I would look at it.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Just one...","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then as we're spending back a little bit incrementally on promotions or whatnot, it might be a flat to slightly negative drag for price.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I just ask it because \u2013 and this has been brought up previously on this call, but if you look at the third quarter compare for volumes, it's fairly easy \u2013 much easier than the second quarter. So that's why I'm just trying to look at those two drivers. But on the SG&A upside, it sounds like it's more of the same what you guys talked about last quarter which is investments and things like sales and IT, et cetera?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, that's what the difference between our original outlook of minus 10 basis points to plus 25 basis points of spending and that was really the conversation last quarter for the full year. Now that incremental 15 basis points is higher medical cost. Just like many other companies we are self-insured and every now and then we have catastrophic events that we have to cover and then, plus higher incentive comp. Gross margin's doing really well. So, is cash flow and we feel good about the outlook.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you for taking my question. I also wanted to go back to your guidance on gross margins for the 110 basis point improvement this year, the expectation. Just wanted to get a sense, as you look at that improvement, is there anything that you would consider unsustainable and I guess and potentially the new base of gross margins that you expect this year?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, the only thing \u2013 again, to break out the 110 basis points we said it was 60 basis points for commodities, 50 basis points for lower manufacturing cost, 10 basis points for price volume mix, 20 basis points from really the new acquisitions and the 30 basis points drag for FX. The commodity stuff, we are starting to lap. That really started a year ago in August. So, back half of 2015.","So, that's not sustainable for our go forward future. So, that's always a risk. Lower manufacturing cost I think, we do a great job in this company with our productivity program and that's really \u2013 that leads into our kind of operating model. Price volume mix, so, typically we are a volume grower. We don't really take price in a lot of categories. Acquisitions, that's all dependent on what we do buy, typically we do recently have bought Personal Care type businesses with higher margins, and then of course the currency as we lap that drag, hopefully that will be a little bit more benign. So hopefully that gives you some color, Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And if I can ask one more question. Just if you look at the overall environment out there, a number of retailers, especially on the grocery side, have missed their comp numbers this past quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about the current environment out there?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, this is a question we get all the time, what's our perspective on the consumer? And I'm not going to tell you anything you haven't read in the Wall Street Journal. So we keep an eye on employment rates, median household income. You can see oil is going down again, it dipped below $40 this week. So obviously, that's good from a disposable income standpoint. But the issue is GDP. So GDP is, some of the banks are calling it 1.5% for the U.S. this year.","So you don't have \u2013 and you don't have significant population growth. So everybody is struggling to find growth in the U.S. and oftentimes the suppliers, producers resort to price, if they don't have innovation. So that's sort of a \u2013 that's what we're looking at right now, Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you for all the color.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Lauren.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, I just had one last question on the promotional environment. So I guess, laundry more so than litter is probably a category where when commodity costs improve you've seen the environment flare up over time. So a couple of questions: one, would you say, there are other categories in your portfolio where you feel like they are more commodity sensitive vis-\u00e0-vis promotional activity and that sort of this change in environment maybe should have been anticipated or in your outlook to begin with. Luckily, you've got plenty of wiggle room to deal with it.","And then secondly, same would be on litter, just the standpoint you knew that Clorox was launching, I would actually think that maybe it was intentional to step back, let them spend a bunch and then kind of when that quieted down to get more active. So it's just the pattern of promotional activity doesn't strike me as necessarily surprising in litter. And then just if laundry you think is more commodity related than anything else? Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hey, Lauren, did you say you were surprised by the promotional activity in litter?","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No. I'm not actually at all.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. Because obviously we have Tidy Cat getting behind their light weight variants and Clorox has their litter with Febreze, so...","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Just thought you'd be tactical on your part. Like the other two have a lot of like noise, like let them promote their noise and then you'd kind of a take a break and then come back into the market?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Exactly, so we had pulled back on amount sold on deal in the second quarter for litter, and we lost some share. Okay. That's fine. It's not like that we're surprised by that, but one quarter doesn't make a year. Your question is, if you think about our various categories, are there a lot of other categories that are sensitive to commodities? I would say, other than laundry, that's where all the questions go and why, because we're worried about surfactants and ethylene prices and resin, et cetera.","If you think about all the commodities that we sweat \u2013 just going to run down them. So there is surfactants, which is derived from ethylene and then you have resin. Diesel, which is going to affect our transportation costs, but that affects everything. Latex for condoms, but that's actually a small part of the cost of goods sold. And then you have paper, so we have so many things that are packaged in paperboard. So, and then as you get a lot smaller after that, soda ash, which is pretty tepid right now and things like palm fatty acid distillate. So, we would say with the exception of laundry, there aren't a lot of categories that we'd say are going to be dramatically affected by commodities.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Lauren, I would add two things. Number one; I wouldn't expect \u2013 our comments on promotional volume isn't really saying we're going to go spend a lot of money back in the laundry category to drive promotions. We're going to continue to support OXICLEAN laundry. Right now if you look at the data, our amount sold on deal just in total is lower than a year ago or right at levels of a year ago. So we're not throwing a whole ton of money back into across the brands.","The other thing I would say is from a commodity perspective; commodities are starting to inch up. So, we've said previously in Q1 and Q2, for example, that resin was down 10%, surfactants were down 20% and that was true. The second half, we're starting to lap those comparisons. So resin will likely be closer to be flat and surfactants will probably be closer to up slightly, just for context.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. Thank you so much.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Lauren.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Powers with UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Hey, guys, I guess first, just one more cleanup if I could on the organic growth guidance for Q3.You got the increased promotional investment and I'm sure it's all to some extent conservative. But you call out in the release a more difficult year-over-year comparison in International specifically and again, my numbers could be incorrect. But it looks like both the one year and two year comps actually get sequentially easier in Q3 versus Q2. So can you just comment there, is there something that I'm missing or that you're specifically concerned about lapping?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think, you're exactly right, Steve. I think, our comment started off at a country or two, Australia for example, has a high comp and that evolved to a one-liner in the release. But International, as I said before, the first half was really 10% growth and so with the full year at 7% to 8% and that means the second half is going to be closer to 4% or 5%. That's really the context you should think of for the International growth for the year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I guess more \u2013 kind of more broadly, I think, it was back at your Analyst Day in January, you spent some time talking about distribution wins that you've been making over the past three years, four years, five years. I just wonder if you could weigh in a little bit on how much of the strength you've seen in this year is aided by even more distribution wins. And I'm guessing it's pretty broad-based where you're seeing it, but just if you can comment on which businesses you're having \u2013 those wins are having the most impact. I'm assuming it's things like vitamins and BATISTE. But, again, some context there will be helpful? Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No, there is no question, you hit the two that are leading the pack and one is vitamins, where as I said in my opening remarks that we have 5% increase in distribution which is pretty significant, because obviously that carries over into future quarters. And then BATISTE is just a craze. So it's getting more and more shelf space. And when you're the \u2013 there are more and more retailers becoming more interested in it. So, it seems like almost every quarter now, we're gaining more distribution and then that has a compounding effect. That's why we, although, it's a small brand, we continue to talk about it because it is influencing our numbers. So, you've hit on the two big ones there.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for the questions.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jason.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Congratulations on a solid quarter and a good first half.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, thanks. Thank you.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A couple of clarifying questions. First, Rick, your comment on resin and surfactants, in terms of the trajectory in the back half of the year. Were you referring to sort of spot markets or the costs that you actually expect to roll through your P&L?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Spot markets.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And given your buy and I think you were a little bit long on hedges last year, which may have sort of prevented that roll through, is it fair to say that you're probably going to be more favorable than spot throughout the remainder of this year?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we'll be more favorable than spot as we go into 2017.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Okay. So, there is some carryover into next year. And then, back to the questions on the volume trajectory which we've \u2013 there has been a few, right? But you are suggesting that volume decelerates on both a stand-alone and two-year stack basis, particularly on two-year stack pretty substantially despite the incremental spend. So, implicitly you seem to be suggesting that you are not expecting a lot of volumetric response to the incremental promotional dollars you're putting into market. Is that a fair interpretation and, if so, why?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so a couple things. I think I went through the detail of why it's not just the incremental promotional spending. But up against some higher comps for vitamins and the category comps for laundry, for example, and the whole International strong growth but deceleration. We're spending quite a bit of money back on marketing and that's going to take some time to really pull through demand.","On the incremental trade and really couponing spending, those investments are really to drive trial for new products. That's the crux of it. And so we want to get that repeat rate up. I think it's too early to call volume upside from driving trial, so that really \u2013 we're just early in the process, Jason, and we think that when we get back up to our competitors' levels of promotion and are just on par with what we had a year ago even, we think that'll be a nice momentum as we exit 2016.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just to add to that, Jason. If you went to first quarter 2015, the laundry category declined round numbers 1.5%, and then first quarter 2016 it was up 6.5%. So on a stack basis, I know a lot of people like to talk on a stack basis, you'd say laundry was up 5% on a two-year basis. And Q2, on a two-year basis stack, it was 4%. If you go to three and four last year, Q3 was 2.5% and Q4 was 3.5%. So that would suggest, you're going to see deceleration in laundry. If you're a believer in the stack theory and if we think it's going to be around 4% to 5%, we're seeing a deceleration in the laundry category on a year-over-year basis. So who knows that's just math. But it's something to think about.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Are you a believer in the stack theory, when it comes to the laundry outlook?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I was introduced to it by the analysts.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","We like math. We like math. It's an easy calculation.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well. When it's convenient, I think you like to talk about it.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fair, fair. All right. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Andersen with William Blair. Your line is open.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Could you just give us a bit of an update on your capacity utilization in vitamins. I know you've completed the capacity expansion, I think it was 75%, where you sit right now and really the idea here is the contribution margins out of this business, should we expect them to continue to improve as you fill out capacity going forward?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we've talked about capacity utilization in terms of vitamins a few times and we said when we made that investment. It was a 75% increase in capacity in round numbers. When we said that our business was around $300 million and that would take us up to around $525 million. So we have a lot of runway for capacity. We feel great about that. We've made some great strides from a manufacturing perspective. We touched on earlier and even on distribution related to vitamins as well. What was the second part of your question, Jon?","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Well, I guess just kind of where you sit today relative to the $525 million in capacity you have and give us some sense...","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Right. We're not going to give you where our sales are today, but we have plenty of room to run. Your other part of the question was contribution margin.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I talked about that a little bit last quarter and I said, it's going to take us a few years to grow into those fixed overheads. And it really goes back to the fact that, you're right, we have to get some more revenue and more scale. But every quarter that goes by, we get better and better at manufacturing vitamins in Pennsylvania and our skill set just improves all the time. So it's within reach within a few years. So we feel great about that.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","That's helpful. I may have missed this, I apologize if I did, but there's been a lot of discussion around the Nielsen data versus your own shipments. And I understand that non-measured, club, online plays a role in that. In aggregate as you look at it, were your shipments in line with consumption growth?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, absolutely. The other piece I've tried to explain once or twice, there is also a disconnect between when consumption is down and we don't promote in certain categories, our organic growth could be flat or up and so that's also a disconnect between shipments and organic growth.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. So, no disconnect here, no inventory building at retail, just some of these pieces which we can't see through Nielsen or IRI?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, last question for me is just as online continues to grow at a faster rate than the brick and mortar business, what are the implications for your margins if any or are you agnostic with respect to that? Thanks a lot.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we touched on that a little bit earlier as well, we are pretty much agnostic. Because, while margins are tougher sometimes on the Household business. It's also slanted more towards the Personal Care type of portfolio that wants to go online. So, net-net when you blend those two together, we are pretty much agnostic.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask on BATISTE. So roughly to the extent you can, what's the split between sales in the U.S. and international? And then, how do we think about it as a driver from an international standpoint? Is it fair to call it the majority of international growth or is it just not big enough?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, with respect to what our sales are by country, we wouldn't get into that. And one thing I would like to dispel is the belief that the BATISTE is the sole driver of the international business. ARM & HAMMER is growing quite a bit in Canada and Mexico and this is kind of anchored in the benefits of baking soda and that seems to be resonating with people both in developed and emerging markets.","Femfresh is another one I talked about which is feminine hygiene. One interesting phenomenon you might be interested in is there's a lot of product being purchased in Australia and then shipped to China like shelves being swept, we're not the only ones that have benefited that from time-to-time. So, that can help, has helped Australia from here and there.","STERIMAR is the other one I talked about, so that's a nasal hygiene product. Had fabulous growth in Mexico this year and France last year behind strong marketing and lots of new products that we bring out. So it's a nice balance between our export business and our country growth.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then, I realize it's early and I'm not going to explicitly ask about gross margins for next year, but maybe as we sort of think about modeling it, are there any one-off type things, benefits, headwinds that would roll-off next year that we should think about in modeling?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a little early, it's only August, but you may be familiar with our evergreen model. So every year we try to expand our operating margins 50 basis points and generally half of that that will come from SG&A and half of it from gross margin when we try to keep marketing pretty level and not save our way to prosperity by cutting our advertising.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. All right. There are no further questions. I want to thank you all dialing in today. We'll talk to you again at the end of October.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"4602":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (NYSE:USA), Inc.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk, uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a few comments on the quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is finished, we'll open up the call for questions.","So Q3 was an outstanding quarter for our company. Q3 net sales grew 7.2%, which reflects both strong organic sales growth and sales from prior year acquisitions. Sales growth is clearly a powerful earnings lever in an environment with rising input costs.","Organic sales growth was 4.7%, which exceeded our outlook of 3%. Global consumer organic net sales have accelerated sequentially over the last five quarters, as price mix continues to improve. And this performance was a clear standout in comparison to our peers.","Earnings per share was $0.58, which exceeded our outlook by $0.05.","In the U.S., organic sales grew 4.7% with both volume growth and positive price. Our categories are growing and our market shares are healthy: 11 of our 15 categories grew during the quarter, 9 categories have grown for at least four consecutive quarters, and beyond category growth, our share results are solid with 7 out of 11 power brands growing share. As we have said in the past, we have low exposure to private label, about 12% share on a weighted average basis.","Now we're having success in the online class of trade. Global consumer online sales continue to grow. And we continue to expect it to exceed 6% of sales in 2018.","With respect to the promotional environment, 8 of our 11 power brands had a lower percentage of products sold on promotion in Q3 compared to Q3 2017 and still we grew. And this is the second quarter that we've seen this. And we don't expect that to change in Q4.","Our International Consumer business delivered 8.3% organic growth. As you know, International has emerged as a growth driver for our company for the past four years. International markets are a bright spot for Church & Dwight, unlike many of our peers. Canada, Mexico and export had particularly strong quarters. The investments that we've made in new leadership, regional hubs, and our brand focus continue to pay off.","On August 29, the company entered into a long-term cooperation agreement with Shanghai Jahwa, a respected and well established local Chinese CPG company. Shanghai Jahwa will be the exclusive omni-channel distributor for four of our categories, and they would be baking soda, toothpaste, dry shampoo and fem hy. And this is in Mainland China.","This is an important step in our Asia-Pacific strategy. And we're very excited about the partnership, as Jahwa has demonstrated the ability to build strong brands for themselves and other CPG companies in the past in Mainland China. Our algorithm is 6% annual organic growth for the International business. And we expect to meet or beat that number in 2018.","Now turning to specialty products. Q3 was another challenging quarter for us with a 3.3% decline in organic sales. And this of course reflects lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers, who continue to be hurt by low milk prices.","However, we still feel good about our long-term 5% organic sales algorithm, as a result of our acquisitions of businesses serving other species like cattle, swine and poultry.","Now let's go back to the U.S. business for a moment to call out a couple of the big consumption winners in the quarter. In household, ARM & HAMMER detergent reached an all-time high quarterly share of 10.3%. And ARM & HAMMER unit dose consumption grew 31%.","In personal care, BATISTE continued to gain share with 33.5% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category, while the category grew 26.7% in the quarter. Now BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo for the 11th consecutive quarter and continues to be the number one dry shampoo in the world.","So to conclude, we had a terrific quarter. We have a sustainable evergreen business model, because we have brands consumers' love, our company is a friend of the environment, and that is important both to us and to our consumers, and our people make Church & Dwight just a great place to work.","Next up is Rick to give you details on the third quarter and the outlook for Q4 and the full year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.58 per share, compared to an adjusted $0.49 in 2017, up 18.4%. The $0.58 was better than our $0.53 outlook due to a stronger top line and a lower tax rate.","Reported revenues were up 7.2%. Organic sales were up 4.7%, exceeding our Q3 outlook of approximately 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our global consumer growth of 5.4%. We're extremely pleased with our results. This is the second consecutive quarter of global consumer product growth in excess of 5%.","Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic, organic sales increased by 4.7%. As communicated last earnings call, we expected price mix to be positive in the back half of 2018, which is exactly what happened in Q3 with 2.1% price mix growth largely due to year-over-year couponing declines and lower promotional levels.","International organic growth was up 8.3%, driven largely by BATISTE, VITAFUSION and FEMFRESH in the export business. We also had strong growth in Canada and Mexico.","For our Specialty Products division, organic sales declined 3.3% due to lower volume as the dairy economy continues to struggle.","Turning now to gross margin, our third quarter gross margin was 44.3%, a 100 basis point decrease from a year ago. This includes 160 basis point drag for higher commodities, a 70 basis point drag from higher transportation costs, and a 60 basis point drag from other manufacturing, offset by 100 basis points for our productivity program and 90 basis points of favorable volume and price.","Moving now to marketing. Marketing was up $8.6 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was flat at 11.6%, despite recent acquisitions which have a lower spend rate.","For SG&A, Q3 SG&A decreased 20 basis points year-over-year. The $7.5 million increase was primarily due to acquisitions, including intangible amortization costs, incentive comp and IT plus R&D investment spending.","Net operating profit, the operating margin for the quarter was 19.7%. Other expense all in was $16.9 million (sic) [$19.4 million] (7:49), primarily driven by interest expense and higher debt levels related to acquisition.","Next is income tax. Our effective rate for the quarter was 21.9%, compared to 28.7% in 2017, primarily due to tax reform. We now expect the full year rate to be approximately 22%.","And now to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. For the first nine months of 2018, net cash from operating activities was $568 million, an increase of about $145 million from the prior year due to higher cash earnings and a smaller increase in working capital.","A bit of housekeeping here, diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were approximately 251 million and that is the expectation for the full year.","So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights are 4.7% organic sales growth and adjusted EPS growth of 18.4%.","Now, turning to the fourth quarter outlook, we continue to expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.57, a 10% increase over last year's adjusted Q4 EPS or a reported decline of 64% due to 2017 tax law changes.","And now turning to the full year, we now expect organic sales to be approximately 4%. We continue to expect reported sales growth to exceed 9%. We continue to expect full year gross margin to be down 120 basis points, in line with previous guidance. And we are tightening our EPS range to $2.27 per share, or adjusted EPS growth of 17%. We're raising our marketing for the full year to be in excess of 11.5%, as we spend back any earnings beat to continue our momentum as we enter 2019.","And with that, we'll turn it back over to Matt to discuss pricing before we open it up for questions.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Rick. Yeah. Before we open up the line for Q&A, I am going to cover a couple topics. Few words about pricing and tariffs.","So rising commodity and logistics costs have put pressure on our gross margins over the last few months. We've had discussions with our retail partners and made decisions on pricing. In several household categories and geographies we are raising list price in the high single-digit range. And the price increases will start showing up on shelves in Q4. And the pricing covers about a third of our portfolio.","Other categories are being planned for early 2019. Too early to talk about those. Naturally if input costs remain high, promotional support in 2019 would be reduced. And that would be consistent with recent trends.","And then beyond cost inflation, we are impacted by the tariff war, notably in WATERPIK water flossers. And as a result, we are raising price there as well to protect gross profit dollars in 2019.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Congratulations on a great quarter. Matt, can we start on the detail, a little bit more color on the China agreement. How quickly can that ramp for you guys? What does that mean for the growth of the International business. That business has obviously been doing very, very well. What \u2013 why should we not think that this would lead to an acceleration above the 6% target at this point?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, you're like, 6% is not high enough. Huh?","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, look we started making investments almost a year ago in Southeast Asia. You may recall we signed up with DKSH, earlier this year, they're a master distributor. And we've done a lot of training with their people early in this year. And that's starting to pay dividends later in the year in that part of the world.","China is more of a long role too. I mean, this company has in the past been a partner with both Cow (12:13) and SC Johnson. And they're going to be our exclusive distributor in Mainland China. But we think it's going to be a slow build. But once again just like DKSH, we think Shanghai Jahwa is going to help make sure we sustain comfortably a 6% growth rate in the future.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, just one more for Rick. Rick, can you talk a little bit, not that I'm not asking you guys to guide on fiscal 2019. But the higher input cost pressure that everyone is dealing with, higher freight costs that everyone is dealing with. Can you talk a little bit about how much visibility you guys have looking out to 2019 at this point in time? Maybe a little bit of color on how much you have hedged at this point.","And then maybe even comment a little bit, if we kind of stay where we are at this point in time, what level of pressure should we consider on the company's gross margins, both with respect to commodities, freight, tariffs? So we can kind of ascertain that relative to what might be necessary from a pricing perspective, so that the company may or may not be able to deliver on its longer-term algorithm. Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, Kevin. I would just say that we don't really go into a lot of detail at this point in time on 2019. What I would tell you is you are very familiar with our long-term evergreen model. We aim to have gross margin expansion. We aim to have 3% organic sales growth and around 8% EPS growth. All that is kind of the framework in which we operate under.","Yeah, as you know, commodity costs are high. But that is also why companies are leading with pricing decisions and also with lower promotional support. And we're also encouraged as our supply chain continues to build even more incremental productivity programs and progress.","So we're not going to go into gross margin expectations now. I'd tell you, just like any year, we do have a big chunk of the portfolio hedged for next year. So we do have good visibility into what we think is going to happen. But we're doing everything we can to make sure we're in a great position for 2019.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and also congrats on a really nice quarter.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thanks, Rupesh.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","So on pricing, two questions. So first in the \u2013 I guess, the categories that you plan to take pricing in Q4. Are you seeing other players within your categories also taking pricing?","And secondly, related to pricing, do you historically see a negative impact on volume when you have the price increases?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, well, first question, one of the obvious ones I'm sure is one of the categories, litter. And yes, it is. We saw earlier in the year that Clorox announced publicly that they were going to raise price. And we also know that Nestle has done the same with Tidy Cat. So that's one that we're following on.","As far as how we plan these things, yeah, we're planning that conservatively that there will be some impact on volumes as a result of the price increases. And that's sort of baked into our thinking not only for the fourth quarter, but for next year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And the only thing I would add to that, Rupesh, is these price changes are just hitting retail right in Q4. So it's too early to see or tell you if any private label or other competitors would be following.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And then a second question, on the M&A front, there clearly \u2013 we're now in a rising rate backdrop. So from a Church & Dwight perspective, do you guys think you're better positioned in this type of environment on the M&A front maybe versus some of the other players out there?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. We absolutely do, Rupesh. I think, as you know we're significantly under levered, we're right around 2 times. We have a lot of firepower in the balance sheet. So I think we're in a great spot.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you for squeezing me in. Congratulations on a great quarter.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason, you're the third caller, man. We're not squeezing you in.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I know, I'm sorry. I'm used to being squeezed in. It's just \u2013 you're right. It's just a matter of habit. No. Thank you, guys, for slotting me so early. I really appreciate this. This is special.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","That's more like it.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","It's a special day for me. I had a question on M&A, the contribution from WATERPIK. You came in \u2013 you were looking for around $10 million of synergies. Where do you stack and rack on that? And you flagged some of the tariff risk going forward. Can you comment on where the profitability of the business is today?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So two things. So yes, you're right, we had signed up for $10 million of synergies. A lot of that was also international growth, incremental international growth. And we're happy to say that we expect all that to come, which is great. And we really integrated the operations, part of the operations, part of the IT piece, and then largely international. So that's where we stand on integration and synergies.","Your other question was WATERPIK margin. Yeah, it's right where we said it's been at for the last maybe year, year-and-a-half. It's right at company average, around 45%.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's great. When we flow our best estimate of profitability on that business through, we're kind of landing at a organic profit line, EBIT line for you guys, it's been kind of flattish for the year, maybe down a little bit.","Is \u2013 A, is that consistent with how you're seeing it? And, B, if so, can you unpack some of the headwinds? How much is commodities? And it's probably the vast majority of it. And how much of it's reinvestment?","And as we think forward, clearly pricing has been in the news today. Do you expect that pricing, net of commodities, to be enough of a swing factor going into next year to accelerate the organic EBIT?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, a lot of questions there to unpack. I probably won't go back through our full year gross margin bridge.","And early on we said we were getting a little bit of help from acquisitions and divestitures, not necessarily WATERPIK in nature, but some of the smaller bolt-on deals that we had done.","I think from an EBIT growth perspective, again we decided to make some choices when we got a great benefit from tax reform. We felt like we were the one company out of many that let most of the tax reform benefit flow through down to EPS. If you look at our peer group, many people ended up spending that or competing it away. We did not, right? We're going to deliver around 17% EPS growth in 2018. So EBIT growth is \u2013 for the quarter was actually up as well.","But remember, we made some choices to spend back part of that in things that will help us over the next two years, three years, four years, five years. And so we kind of went through that back in February when we gave original outlook, so I wasn't really going to go through that again today.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Very well. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question this morning on your guidance. I'm wondering why you guys expect your Q4 organic sales growth to slow versus Q3 levels. I guess I'm asking this, especially considering the year-over-year comp is pretty similar and the fact that you're stepping up marketing expense in Q4, I guess I would think you'd expect to see some acceleration.","So I guess are you guys just being conservative? Or does that have something to do with the pricing actions that you mentioned that you're putting in for the market?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Let me try to take that, it's Rick. From Q3 to Q4 deceleration, so Q3 organic was 4.7%, right. Our implied organic growth is 3%, 3.5% in Q4. When you say the full year is a 4%. So that's a decline of about 130 basis points.","And then if WATERPIK is growing around 10%, then that would imply that the base business is decelerating by around 200 basis points, 230 basis points. So that's probably the crux of your question.","So around 20 basis points or 30 basis points is because of just, year ago comps, there's a little bit of deceleration, maybe 30 basis points or 40 basis points for SPD, further decelerating because of the dairy economy.","But then pretty much the entire piece, around 170 basis points, is because we have lower promotional spending. It's our lowest trade quarter of the year. It's the lowest couponing quarter of the year. And so what we just saw in Q3 with 8 of 11 power brands being down on promotional spending, we just expect that to continue in this environment.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then I had a question on your sell in versus sell-through. We're still seeing a pretty big gap in the Nielsen data, I think it's about a 300 bp difference in your consumers' domestic business. This came up on your Q2 call. And I think that part of the gap was attributed to certainly the strength you're seeing in non-tracked channels and then maybe a little bit from lower couponing.","So just wanted to hear from you guys if those are still two of the key drivers of the difference this quarter? And then how should we see this gap going forward? Do you expect it to kind of close in the future?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, no, it's a good question, Bonnie. I think you're right, it's a recurring theme that we talk about every quarter. We were \u2013 I think measured channels were around 2%, if you look at Nielsen data. We report 4.7%, so that's 270 basis points. About a third of that is unmeasured channels. So whether it's online growing strongly or Costco or club, those types of unmeasured channels.","And then two-thirds of it is coupon reduction and lower promotional spending. So what doesn't show up in Nielsen, as we talk about all the time, is couponing. And so a big chunk. If you go back to laundry even, and we use Nielsen panel data to \u2013 as an indication. People can use that as an indication.","I think the category for laundry was down 300 basis points in couponing, Church & Dwight was down 1,000 basis points on couponing.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Great quarter, guys.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe to follow up on Jason's question or build on that and also your comments in response, Rick. As you said, we started the year, you'd elected to reinvest a sizable portion of the tax reform benefits back in the business.","Given the strength this quarter, obviously you're reinvesting further into year-end, which I think makes sense to set yourself up for next year.","I guess I'm just trying to parse that a little bit. As we think about all the incremental investments that you've made in totality. Is there a way to frame to what degree they're more kind of one-year discretionary investments, that are likely to or at least could fall away next year? Versus the more structural investments that you mentioned, the ones that may carry a longer term ROI and be with us for the next several years?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I would couch it as most of them are longer term ROI investments, right. Whether it's marketing spending, which is laying the groundwork for not just the next three months, but the next 12 to 24 months in the future, as we build brand equity. Incremental spending for R&D, right? As we lay the groundwork to build a new product portfolio that continues to perform great, like we have in Litter.","Laying the groundwork, as an example we added a few heads around our productivity program and how we organize and really get the ideation sessions around that, in order to increase our productivity target long-term. So all these things are building as long-term investments is what I would say.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair. And then I guess just one quick follow-up, it's sort of nitpicky. But the WATERPIK pricing that you mentioned, I just, I don't have any familiarity with elastically in that business. So can you, just based on what you've learned about that business and what you've sort of learned from their past history, as that business has taken pricing to the extent \u2013 to the same degree that you're planning to next year, what's been the reaction of the brand in the market.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Steve, it's a good question. We bought the business last August. Not too long after we bought the business, we did some elasticity studies with respect to pricing. And so we don't think there is going to be a significant down tick in volume. And it's a couple of intuitive reasons for that.","One is the purchase cycle for water flossers is about kind of every three years. The second thing is that 60% of water flosses are purchased on a doctor's recommendation. And the last thing would be, we're kind of like 98% share of the category, so sort of are the category. So for those reasons, I think there is opportunity to increase price.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Matt. So just two quick questions. One is on just the M&A environment. Obviously you guys have a very good balance sheet with some capacity to do some stuff. So just curious on what you're seeing out there. Looks like at least from the publicly traded companies, valuations are coming down. I'm wondering if that's also happening in the private world as well. So that's the first question.","And then the second question is, most companies this quarter have had really good numbers in the U.S. And maybe you can just provide some context around, is this just category growth picking up all of a sudden? Or is the fact that Walmart, which is typically everyone's biggest customer, is having some pretty good same-store sales numbers? Maybe any color around that I think would be really useful. Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Nik, in my remarks, one of the things I said was, in the U.S. our categories are growing, and they have been growing. We have 9 categories out of our 15 that have grown in last four quarters consecutively.","So and then if you look at our 15 categories on a weighted average basis, we're over 3%. And last quarter was, I think we said it was 2.7%, the quarter before that was 3% plus as well.","So when you look at companies, you have to say, what categories are they in? So we're all not the same. So we happen to have categories that have strength, and we also have strong brands as well.","Now your question on M&A would be, obviously we do have a strong balance sheet. But we're very fussy about what we're going to buy. So you need to be number one or two brands, right, they have to have corporate or higher gross margins, got to be able to grow, and they need to be asset light. So it does knock a lot of things out when we start looking at things, but we are always in the hunt.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just on the...","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And as this...","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, sorry.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, I would just add, in terms of your value question, Nik, as interest rates continue to go up, then you're right, valuations tend to come in. I mean, that's overarching what happens over time.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, just back on WATERPIK, just trying to understand. I think you walked a little bit through its impact to organic growth. But is there a thought that \u2013 I mean I'm just trying to understand how it's infecting international business? I know it's all kind of classified in consumer domestic. But maybe you can help me understand if that's a driver of the International business?","And also from the International, like is there a region \u2013 I know you had invested in three different regions over the past few years. If there was one that was kind of exceeding expectations? Or they were all kind of consistent?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Let me take a swing at that, Bill. So we have this 6% algorithm. And when you look at the 8.3% organic growth in the quarter, we're over 6% without WATERPIK. So we're not going to actually call out, well, what \u2013 how many basis points. But International is healthy and hitting its algorithm without WATERPIK. But obviously it did become part of our organic in the quarter, so that helped to pop it a bit.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. So it is split for Consumer Domestic and International in terms of the organic...","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. WATERPIK goes...","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","...into both divisions. I would tell you, just to expand on Matt's comments, it was \u2013 it went organic for about a month, maybe a month and a week. And actually I think with or without WATERPIK, the rate for International would've been the same in the quarter.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And I mean just sticking on that theme, I mean was there anything else International? Like is BATISTE continuing to do extremely well in the UK? Or is there any other key driver? Or is it just kind of across the board steady?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, if you think about the International business, some of the businesses that are doing really well are, in export, it would be BATISTE, VITAFUSION and FEMFRESH, which is a feminine hygiene product but not sold in the U.S., but outside the U.S.","But we've had strength in the countries as well. So if you want to know, in Mexico, it's pretty much ARM & HAMMER across the board, ARM & HAMMER products, so ARM & HAMMER laundry, ARM & HAMMER dental care, ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico doing extremely well. And Canada, BATISTE and VITAFUSION, similar to export, but also ARM & HAMMER litter. You may remember a few years ago, we took litter up into Canada, and that continues to grow. So we've had strength in the countries as well as strength in export this quarter.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I'm not going to ask a WATERPIK question. But wanted to ask you on your consumer products pricing announcements. Wanted to make sure I heard everything correctly. Did you say you're taking 30% \u2013 or sorry, high single-digit pricing across 30% of the portfolio. Is that math correct?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, we said \u2013 I said a third. But yeah, you're right.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And that's on top of the reduced couponing. So I think that this is \u2013 this announcement is incremental to kind of the success we saw in 3Q?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Correct.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then if we kind of like roll that through to think about what that implies for volume, you're still implying that volumes are going to be up slightly for the fourth quarter. Is that the right framework?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. That's correct. We think we're going to have balanced positive volume and positive price mix for Q4.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then the last one would be for the marketing spend. It sounds like you guys feel pretty encouraged and are putting some more back into the business in Q4. What specific brands are you seeing the most responsive to with the ad spend in the marketplace that you felt like taking that up? Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, we have over 80 brands, but we have 11 brands that represent 80% of our revenues and profits. So we'd be ploughing these back into the power brands.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I have two questions around SG&A. First, in terms of the marketing spend increase plans. Are there specific categories where you've decided you want to push the spend? Or is it pretty much across the board, since you have that capability at this point?","And then in terms of the SG&A leverage \u2013 or the SG&A for Q3, I'm surprised that you didn't get a little bit more leverage off of a pretty strong top-line beat. So I was wondering if you could go into that a little bit? Because your results were pretty impressive. But obviously you didn't see too much leverage on SG&A. Thank you.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So the first question, Matt just answered that from Steve, Olivia. I don't know if you didn't hear it when he was in queue. But really saying that we have 80 brands, but we're going to be spending back the marketing incrementally on the power brands that matter.","Your second question on SG&A. We're actually thrilled that we did leverage it, all right? We're down 20 basis points from a leverage perspective. And this whole front part of the year, we haven't been leveraging SG&A, because of all these small deals that have higher SG&A rates.","And so just the fact that the WATERPIK amortization kind of rolled, we're comping that now, as an example, in a large way. It just gives us great confidence that our model is intact, once we get through this transition 11, 12 months.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, thanks. And then I'm interested in this China agreement that you referenced earlier in your prepared remarks. I mean what's the plan there? Is it going to be more around personal care brands versus household? And just a little bit more color on that would be great.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Are you talking about the Jahwa partnership? You kind of broke up a little bit.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Yeah.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So we did reference it in our prepared remarks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","You mean the categories, are you interested in? Yeah.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Exactly.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So it's \u2013 yeah, it's ARM & HAMMER baking soda, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste, BATISTE dry shampoo and feminine hy products would be FEMFRESH. Those will be the four categories.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about China. Because I know I think it was about 1% of International back in 2016. So I was just kind of curious why these are the four categories you chose to go with? I don't really know anything honestly about the baking soda I guess category, or sort of the Chinese view of baking soda as an ingredient. So just anything you could offer on again these four categories and what's already in the market? Because I know it was a little small piece of the business before this announcement? Thanks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So before going forward and picking a partner, we did a lot of homework on what categories would resonate most with the Chinese consumer.","And one in particular we thought was very important, it was ARM & HAMMER baking soda. So ARM & HAMMER for our company is $1 billion of our $4 billion dollars in sales. And we've had some success with going internationally with ARM & HAMMER. And we thought that was an important one to set as a foundation for the future in China.","And then the other categories we picked like toothpaste, dry shampoo and fem hy, again, because of our market studies, we thought that we had products that would resonate with the Chinese consumer. So that's why we picked those. And our partner is pretty excited about taking those to market for us.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. And I think I could say thanks for squeezing me in by the way. Appreciate that.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Wow, I didn't know you guys were so sensitive to the queue.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","No. Just kidding. It's all good. So first question I guess is on guidance, and if you look at the third quarter you beat your guidance by about a nickel, you're effectively keeping your full year unchanged. And I know you mentioned you're spending a lot of that upside back in marketing. And I'm sure there is probably some conservatism baked into that as well.","But beyond those two items, is there something else that sort of changed materially from 3Q to 4Q? Was it really just the higher marketing and conservatism?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Not really. You're right. It's predominantly higher marketing. We might spend a couple million bucks more on R&D again to lay the groundwork for the future but those are \u2013 marketing is the bigger one by far.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And, Joe, you know at the end of the second quarter we had a beat as well. And we said we're going to \u2013 to the extent that that continues for the year, we're going to spend it back primarily in marketing or any other areas we think can help us long term. And people who have followed us for years know that's consistent with our past practices.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Is retail destocking still an issue at this point? Or is sell in and sell through sort of converging?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, Joe, you can go back and look at the script for the last in perpetuity. We've never called out retailer destocking as an issue. I think it is an issue sometimes in different competitors or different categories, but it just so happens in our categories, we've never really called that out as an issue.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay and just last one, SPD, how big is dairy for that business, given all the acquisitions you've done (38:01)?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","It's kind of round numbers we have, it's a $300 million business. You could see that in the K. And the simple way to think about it is, it's two-thirds, one-third; one-third is bulk sodium bicarbonate, two-thirds is the animal productivity business and that is largely the dairy business. But wouldn't go into too much more detail than that.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's fine. Okay, thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you. So on the organic sales drivers, can you update us on how Trojan performed during the quarter? So historically, you've seen some share losses, but has it stabilized recently? And how are you thinking of the way to reposition the brand to go back to market share gains and potentially grow the category again?","And on a separate basis, I was wondering how you did so well in laundry? And you \u2013 and Rick commented on couponing being less of an issue. I was wondering how the pie as in total in the U.S. has expanded. So I wonder how, if you can comment on the category from the second quarter to the third quarter, how it expanded. Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. With respect to Trojan and condoms. So the condom category has been under pressure now for many, many quarters. And the reason for that is because a lot of other alternatives that are out there, like Plan B, for example, and the resurgence of IUDs, etc.","So we are the category leader. The good news is that in our most recent quarter, we gained share, although consumption is down in the category, our consumption was not as down as much as in the category.","And more recently things have been turning more positive for consumption of Trojan condoms. And this is largely due to we have a new Trojan campaign, and we have a new Trojan Man. So I encourage everybody to go out there and look for it. And the new Trojan Man is promoting, it's a big sexy world, so you want to protect yourself with a condom.","So the condoms like I said is, there's some secular changes that are going on there with respect to other alternatives. But it is up to us to drive the category. And we think we have a really great campaign right now that's going to help us do that.","With respect to laundry, yeah. So the laundry category is less promotional that it was. It's down 130 basis points year over year. As far as in liquid laundry, the liquid laundry category grew 1%, ARM & HAMMER grew 5%.","And in unit dose, unit dose category grew 9%, so that sort of reaccelerated. In previous three or four quarters, unit dose only grew \u2013 the category only grew 5%. But this quarter up 9%. But we grew at \u2013 ARM & HAMMER grew 31%. And ARM & HAMMER now has a 4.4% share in unit dose, so it's up 70 bps.","So ARM & HAMMER had a really spectacular quarter. The other two brands, XTRA. We have \u2013 in the prior years, XTRA was declining in share. Last quarter it actually held, was up a little bit. And this quarter down 10 basis points. So we think we've stabilized XTRA.","OXICLEAN on the other hand, there was a pullback in the quarter for us. And we found that OXICLEAN does well when it's promoted and less well when it's not. So we've kind of been banging around between a 1.1% share when we don't promote, and 1.8% or 1.9% share when we do promote.","So all-in, I mean ARM & HAMMER was the star in the quarter. OXICLEAN fell back. And XTRA was \u2013 pretty much went sideways.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, that's very help. And, Matt, just to make sure I \u2013 it's, all your comments on the percentages, it's all-in dollars, right, I'm assuming? Category growth in dollars.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. That's consumption. Yeah, consumption dollars.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Oh, perfect. All right. Thank you. Appreciate.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. One is you talked about being price sensitive on M&A. But I'm just wondering what the quality of the deals that you are being shown is like compared to history? Are you seeing things that are very interesting, and it's a price issue? Or you're just not seeing anything that interests you?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, look, we would never comment on what we're looking at or what categories. But we have huge discipline with respect to what we'll buy in the company.","And as you know, Caroline, we don't \u2013 we look at what the fully synergized multiple is when we pay something. So I mean for example, we bought OXICLEAN, we paid 17 times trailing. We bought ORAJEL, we paid 13.5 times trailing EBITDA.","But when you look at \u2013 so you might say, wow, those are expensive. But when you look at after we've owned them for a year and after we've increased distribution or share or taken out costs, you find that we've paid close to 10 times for these.","So I would say there's always something to buy. And so you can only buy what's for sale. But there are plenty of things for sale right now.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And as Matt points out, his comment is really valuation hasn't been the biggest hurdle for us in our past.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And you had a couple of categories where you didn't gain share. And not to take anything away from really spectacular results for the whole year, but what do you think the challenges are in those categories versus others? Is it anything systemic?","And was vitamins one of them? If you could just update us on vitamins, because it was an area where there was a lot of private label. How are you doing there?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Even though you got 7 out of 11 brands that grew, it's always what's not going well. So of the four, yeah, vitamins is one of them. But the good news is vitamin continues to grow. So it is a growth area for us. It's just that we're not growing as fast as the category. And there's certainly been \u2013 there are a lot of entrants into gummy vitamins, and that's okay. But we're \u2013 even though we didn't grow share in \u2013 we didn't grow as fast as the category, we are growing. So that's the good news, Caroline, on vitamins.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and morning, everybody. Two unrelated questions. One just back on the specialty business. I think you said at the Investor Day, non-dairy was going to be a little more than 15% of the business. I guess you sort of directionally answered that to Joe's question.","I guess the question there is, dairy production certainly seems increasingly competitive. How do you think about where you are in that business at this point? Maybe even relative to where you were 12 months ago or the future competitiveness of it? Or does it need to shift a bit towards other animals, other categories within it?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, we've made three acquisitions over the last three years to get us into other species. And you saw we were down 3% organically this quarter. We would have been way down if we had not gotten into these other species. So that is the good news.","As far as the dairy industry goes, the trade war has made things far worse for pricing than we had expected. And so you may know this, is that Mexico is the number one importer of cheese from the U.S. And China is the number one importer of whey protein from the U.S., all from the dairy industry.","So that's put a lot of pressure on exports, being \u2013 particularly to China. Hasn't hurt as much for Mexico. Now the \u2013 those retaliatory tariffs have not come down yet. All that stuff has to be ratified before they're going to come down. So they're still in place. But we do expect dairy prices to recover next year.","And it is a cyclical business. So we've seen this movie before. But because we're getting into these other species, we think that over time it's going to flatten out. And we'll have sustainable organic growth of around 5%.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then shifting to WATERPIK, kind of unrelated to some of the other questions. I guess just thinking about it more holistically. So what are you learning so far in selling a product that's a bit different than the other products that you're selling? And can you lever the platform for other similar type non-staple-y products?","And then sort of related to that, the innovation you introduced with the whitening tablets, which does seem a bit more staple-y, how has that performed relative to expectations? And kind of what does that mean for the future in terms of what you can do with it?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. The opportunity for WATERPIK is both U.S. and international. You may recall when we bought the business that household penetration outside the U.S. was in the mid to low single-digits. And the company had hit upon just a terrific strategy in how to reach hygienists and dentists. And that was by having a large number of hygienists, not employees, but more third parties, calling on hygienists and dentists, promoting the product.","So in the U.S. we reach about a quarter of all the dentists in the United States in that manner. And we're replicating that model outside the U.S. right now, both in Europe and in Canada.","So early signs are that the model works outside the U.S. as well as it does in the U.S. So I hope that answers your question about how we expect to grow this in the future and where the growth is going to come from. We still think we have plenty of runway in the U.S. as well.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt Farrell for closing remarks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Well, thank everybody. We'll be announcing our fourth quarter results in early February. As usual, we'll be down at the New York Stock Exchange when we do that. And we'll hope to see you all then.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation.

Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce to you your host for today, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","James R. Craigie","Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my overview on our third quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspectives on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you.","Let me start out by saying that I'm very proud of my team for delivering the excellent third quarter business results in such a difficult business environment. Despite headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures, the third quarter results reflect double-digit net sales growth of 11% versus year ago, an all-time company record for gross margin of 45.4%, which was 20 basis points above year ago. This is also the fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, an 8% increase in marketing spending versus year ago, with supported share growth on 7 of our 9 power brands, a 15% increase in operating income and an 80-basis-point increase in operating margin versus year ago, a 15% increase in earnings per share versus year ago, and a 75% increase in free cash flow versus year ago.","In addition, I'm pleased to report that we have finished the integration of our most recent acquisition, the Avid Health gummy vitamin company, across every business function. The Avid acquisition continues to deliver outstanding results, with double-digit sales growth and better-than-expected cost synergies. So despite continued headwinds, the excellent results for the first 3 quarters of 2013 make us feel very confident in achieving our aggressive annual EPS growth target of a 14% increase versus year ago.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt to give you more details on our third quarter results, and then I'll return to provide some further insights on the results of our key brands and provide additional details on my outlook for the year.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everybody. Third quarter EPS was $0.76 per share compared with $0.66 in 2012, as Jim said, up 15.2%. Our reported earnings were up 11% to $804.8 million. Organic sales was up 1.6%, which was slightly above the midpoint of our previously communicated expectations of a range of 1% to 2%. I'm now going to review the segments.","The organic sales of the Consumer Domestic business increased by 0.8%, primarily due to higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN laundry additives, TROJAN products and FIRST RESPONSE diagnostic kits. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, NAIR depilatories and SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes.","Volume growth contributed 4.5% to the increase in sales and, as expected, was partially offset by 3.7% unfavorable product mix and pricing. In contrast, price mix in Q2 was a negative 2%. So the result is consistent with our plans to remain price competitive in Q3 and also in Q4.","International increased organic growth by 3.7% in Q3, due to higher sales in Canada, France, Mexico and the U.K. This increase of 3.7% was entirely driven by volume gains.","For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales increased by 3.7%. This was a nice rebound from the weak second quarter. Volume increases drove a 7.9% increase in sales, partially offset by 4.2% unfavorable product mix and pricing.","Turning now to gross margin. Our reported third quarter gross margin was 45.4%, a 20-basis-point expansion from year ago. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the positive impact of productivity programs and is remarkable as we overcame considerable negative price mix in the third quarter. Year-over-year commodity costs were relatively neutral for the quarter, with a notable exception of resin, which, many of you know, is at a 3-year high right now. As a result of our Q3 gross margin performance and our expectation that Q4 will be the sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, we now expect gross margin for the full year 2013 to expand by approximately 75 basis points.","With respect to marketing, year-over-year marketing spend increased 8% to $99.7 million or 12.4% of revenues, which is a 30-basis-point decline from the prior year spend rate. We continue to support new product launches and grew dollar share on 7 of our 9 power brands. This is due to great execution by our sales and marketing teams. For the full year, we expect marketing, as a percentage of sales, to increase approximately 25 basis points.","SG&A year-over-year increased by $7.8 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting the inclusion of the Avid business. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was 12.1%, down 30 basis points from year ago in the quarter. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be about 13% of sales, and that would be 30-basis-points improvement from year ago. And we continue to focus on SG&A as a lever to drive future operating margin expansion.","The reported operating margin for the quarter was 20.8%, which was 80 basis points higher than last year's 20%. Income from affiliates was flat in the quarter year-over-year. Other expense was unfavorable year-over-year, primarily due to interest expense related to the Avid acquisition. And this holds true on a full year basis as well, as we expect a decrease of $14 million in other income on a full year basis, primarily related to interest expense.","Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.9% compared to last year's 35.7%. The full year effective tax rate, we now expect to be approximately 34%.","A little bit of history on the tax rate. Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 34%. Q2 was 34.5%, so we're already trending lower with respect to our effective tax rate versus our 35% call for the year. With the 33.9% rate in Q3, it's pretty obvious now the full year will be closer to 34%. So we got a couple pennies of benefit in the first half versus our full year expectation.","Cash flow. Turning now to cash, we generated $376.6 million of net cash from operations for the first 9 months of 2013. We have spent approximately $30 million year-to-date in CapEx, which is approximately $90 million decrease from a year ago, which included the construction of our California plant. We expect to spend approximately $70 million on full year CapEx.","There were no share repurchases made in either the second quarter or the third quarter, and we have no plans for share purchases in the fourth quarter. That will leave us with approximately $220 million remaining on our share purchase authorization by year-end. Our cash balance right now is approximately $450 million, and we expect to end the year with a cash balance approaching $500 million and levered approximately 1.2x versus EBITDA.","So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include 1.6% organic sales growth, it's the fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, and 15.2% earnings per share growth. We expect fourth quarter EPS of approximately $0.65 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year.","I'm going to turn it back to Jim right now.","James R. Craigie","Thanks, Matt. I'll finish up the call today by adding a little color to our third quarter results, which Matt just took you through, and my outlook on the year. As stated earlier, those of you who've heard me speak before, know that I've been a long-term pessimist about the business environment. The latest forecast of weak GDP growth, continued high unemployment and weak same-store sales by major retailers provide little hope for significant near-term improvement in the U.S. economy.","In fact, of the 14 categories in the U.S. that Church & Dwight operates in, 6 experienced lower category dollar sales in the third quarter versus the prior year. When a category is flat to down, it creates a much more intense competitive environment, as the only way to drive organic growth is to gain market share through higher marketing spending, new product innovations and\/or aggressive pricing.","All consumer packages companies are fighting these headwinds. But as I told you many times before, I believe no other consumer packages company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment.","There are 7 key factors to support that statement. First, we have a unique product portfolio within the CPG industry. It consists of both premium and value brands, which puts us in the position to thrive in any type of economy, as exemplified by our ability to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the last 12 consecutive years. In particular, our value brands, representing over 40% of our revenue base, have experienced strong growth in this recessionary economy as consumers are generally making smart choices by switching to and staying with our high-quality but lower-priced brands. A great example of this is our value-based Laundry Detergent business, which consists of 2 brands, ARM & HAMMER and XTRA. These brands fell for 1\/2 to 2\/3 less than premium price brands and delivering exceptional cleaning performance. Consumers love our value brand detergents, as proven by the fact that more U.S. households buy a value brand than premium or mid-priced laundry detergent brands. The great value delivered by our 2 brands have resulted in steady share growth.","In the third quarter, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a record quarterly share of 10.1%, which was its 15th consecutive quarter share growth versus year ago, and has now clearly surpassed the all brand to become the #3 liquid laundry brand in America. ARM & HAMMER was 1 of only 2 major brands to deliver share growth in both the third quarter and the latest 52 weeks.","Our other liquid laundry detergent brand called XTRA also achieved a record quarterly share in the third quarter. It is now the #2 liquid laundry detergent brand on a wash load basis, representing 1 out of 7 wash loads in America.","As a result of the strong performance by both ARM & HAMMER and XTRA liquid laundry detergents, Church & Dwight was the only major manufacturer to grow total detergent dollar sales in the third quarter. The strong consistent share growth on both of these brands has enabled Church & Dwight to increase its liquid laundry detergent market share by 50% over the past 5 years and become the #2 laundry detergent company in America.","The second factor, which is a key driver of Church & Dwight's success, is that we have a proven record of building share on our power brands. We have over 80 brands in total, but 8 of our brands are historic power brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profits. We have now added a nice power brand with the acquisition of the Avid gummy vitamin business. From 2008 through 2012, we grew market share on each of the 8 historic power brands in almost 75% of the quarters. In the third quarter of this year, we grew market share on 6 of our 8 historic power brands and 7 of our 9 power brands, including the gummy vitamin business.","Three key factors drive these excellent results. First, we have effectively reinvested some of the increased profits from the strong growth of our value brands to increase marketing support on our power brands. In the third quarter of 2013, we increased our marketing support by 8% or $7.5 million versus year ago. This increased marketing support was a key driver behind record quarterly shares achieved in ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, our FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kit business and our OXICLEAN laundry additive business.","The second factor driving this growth of our power brands is our robust pipeline of new products. Over the past 4 years, new products delivered about 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We have launched innovative new products in almost every key category this year. A sample of these new products includes ARM & HAMMER's new Ultra Power laundry detergent, which provides consumers with a more concentrated liquid laundry detergent in a smaller bottle, which is easier to handle, more environmentally friendly and enables dosage control for lightly soiled or heavily soiled wash loads. This new product drove 70% of the total third quarter sales growth on ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry brand, which enabled the brand and our total business to achieve its 15th consecutive quarter of share growth.","Other new products that have been launched in 2013 or late 2012 include: a new line of sexual lubricants under the TROJAN brand name; a new toothbrush under the ARM & HAMMER Tooth Tunes brand, which plays music by the One Direction boys band; a new single-dose cold sore treatment under the Orajel brand. More detailed information on all these innovative new products is on Church & Dwight's website.","Part of the increased marketing spending behind these innovative new products is increased sampling. For example, we are driving awareness in trial of our new TROJAN lubricant line by providing samples in 4 million boxes of TROJAN condoms. And to drive awareness in trial of our great-tasting line of gummy vitamins, we are increasing in-store sampling by over 50% versus last year.","In addition to the increased marketing spending on innovative new products, the other key driver of share growth on our power brands is increased distribution. As a result of the consistent strong share growth on our power brands over the past 5 years, the Church & Dwight sales force has worked closely with our retail partners to increase the shelf space of our brands to meet the increased consumer demand and minimize out of stocks. The distribution gains achieved to-date in 2013 across all brands has been the greatest of my 9-year tenure as CEO.","The combined effect of the innovative new products, increased marketing spending and increased distribution, delivered share gains in 7 of our 9 power brands in the third quarter, which puts us in the position to deliver stronger organic growth in 2014, behind an incredible pipeline of innovative new products in our core business, continued strong growth of new Gummy Vitamin business and an improvement in the sales of our cyclical Specialty Products business.","Let me just wrap up at this point about my company's ability to grow our power brands with the following Q3 share results on our other power brands. OXICLEAN powdered laundry additive grew its category-leading share by 1.8 percentage points to a record quarterly share of 42.9%. It is now over 2x larger than its nearest competitor. TROJAN grew its leading position of the combined U.S. condom, vibrator and lubricant business by having great new products and increased marketing spending. For example, the new TROJAN lubricant line, which was launched in the second quarter, has already achieved a 7% share of the lubricant category. And our Condom business has an industry-leading 76% market share, driven by constant product innovations, which has resulted in TROJAN having all 10 of the top 10 selling condoms in the market. FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits achieved a record quarterly share of 31.8%, up 1.2 percentage points versus year ago. And it's been the #1 selling pregnancy test kit for 35 consecutive quarters. NAIR achieved share gains in the third quarter to maintain its share leadership position for the 36th consecutive quarter.","And finally, our new Gummy Vitamin business had a terrific third quarter. Li'l Critters, our kids vitamin brand, grew its dollar share to maintain its position as the #1 kids gummy for the eighth consecutive quarter. Vitafusion, our adult vitamin brand, grew its share, driven by a 40% consumption growth. Vitafusion is the #1 adult gummy vitamin for the past 8 quarters, with 6 of the top 10 SKUs, and is the fastest-growing adult vitamin brand for the past 52 weeks. In total, Church & Dwight is the market leader in gummy vitamins, with a 37% share. The gummy vitamin category grew 27% in the third quarter versus year ago, which is 6x faster than the growth rate for the overall vitamin business consisting largely of hard pills. We believe that the gummy category should continue to deliver double-digit growth for the foreseeable future, as it only represents about 9% of the total vitamin business.","In total, that's a pretty impressive scorecard for Q3 share results for our power brands. Now let me quickly run through the 5 other key drivers of Church & Dwight's success.","Number three is that we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands, as evidenced by our ferocious defense of OXICLEAN when a large competitor entered the category several years ago. OXICLEAN not only deflected the impact of the attack on other competitors, but has now strengthened its leadership position through the record share levels achieved in the third quarter. OXICLEAN is now larger than the combined share of the #2, 3 and 4 competitors in the laundry additive category.","The number four factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our international business. While our international business represents only about 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered strong sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the past 5 years. The growth continued in the third quarter, with 3.7% organic growth, driven by excellent results in Canada, France, Mexico and the U.K. The international organic growth would've been even stronger, except for lower sales of our NAIR brand, which is impacted by the cooler-than-expected weather this summer in Europe.","Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margins through cost-optimization programs, supply-chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher-margin new products. Driving improved gross margin is deeply ingrained in Church & Dwight's organization. We not only talk the talk, but we walk the walk. 25% of every Church & Dwight employee's annual bonus is based on achieving our gross margin improvement target. I am not aware of any other consumer packages company that explicitly has gross margin targets in their employee bonus programs. This deeply ingrained focus on gross margin has enabled Church & Dwight to expand gross margins by 1,450 basis points over the past 11 years.","Headwinds from higher commodity costs stalled our gross margin improvement in 2010 and 2011, but we were able to overcome these headwinds by the middle of 2012 to deliver 2 consecutive quarters of 100-plus-basis-point gains in gross margin versus year ago in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. This momentum continues in the first half of 2013, with 110 point -- basis point increase in gross margin versus year ago in both the first and second quarters of this year. Despite the fact that we are now lapping the 100-plus-basis-point gross margin gain achieved in the third quarter of 2012, we still achieved a 20-basis-point improvement in the third quarter of 2013 to achieve a record quarterly gross margin of 45.4%. And as Matt and I mentioned earlier, the cost synergies from the integration of the gummy vitamins acquisition are exceeding expectations. So as a result, we expect to continue to deliver gross margin improvement versus year ago in the current fourth quarter.","The sixth factor behind our continued success is our ability to reduce SG&A as a percent of net sales by tightly managing overhead costs and leveraging our strong organization via acquisitions. We reduced SG&A as a percent of net sales to 12.1% in the third quarter and expect to continue to reduce SG&A costs as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter. This should enable Church & Dwight to continue to have the highest revenue per employee of any major consumer packaged goods company.","Finally, factor number seven is our strong record on free cash flow conversion. Like gross margin, free cash flow is another one of the company's key components on our annual bonus program for all employees. As a result of having every employee focused on and incentivized to deliver higher free cash flow, we have quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. Over the past 5 years, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income averaged 122%, which was best in class in the consumer packaged goods industry.","As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we delivered a strong increase in free cash flow in the third quarter. This cash flow and our strong balance sheet has enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain, including construction of more efficient new plants, and the acquisition of leading brands. All these factors give me great confidence about our ability to deliver our aggressive 2013 EPS target of $2.79, which is an increase of 14% over 2012 EPS. We believe we can deliver that aggressive EPS target despite continued headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures.","Our confidence in delivering this aggressive EPS target is based on 2 key factors. First, we believe we can continue to deliver the market share gains in our power brands. These share gains are expected to result from innovative new products, increased marketing spending and significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands that I've mentioned earlier. Second, we believe we can deliver gross margin expansion of approximately 75 basis points on our total business in 2013, including new Gummy Vitamin business. The higher projected gross margin should enable us to be price competitive and increase marketing spending versus year ago on our power brands to deliver the share gains. Unfortunately, these share gains cannot fully offset the weaker-than-expected category trends and the ongoing need to continue to aggressively compete on pricing in a few key categories. So we are now projecting organic sales growth of approximately 1.5% to 2% for the full year.","While this outlook on organic growth is lower than our initial annual goal of 3% to 4%, the share gains we have achieved on the 7 of our 9 power brands should put us in a position to return to higher organic growth levels in 2014, behind a great new pipeline of innovative new products on our global Consumer business, continued strong growth in our new Gummy Vitamin business and an expected improvement in the sales of our cyclical Specialty Products business.","In conclusion, 2013 has been and continues to be another very challenging year. But when things get tough, you should place your bets in the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and a management team that has a track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver consistently strong EPS growth.","This ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Jim, could you just talk a little bit more about kind of the growth outlook next year? I'm just trying to understand -- I mean, obviously, you have the easy comps on the Specialty business and the Avid business in the mix. But are you expecting the categories to turn up -- I mean, because I would -- seem like you need some category growth to get overall growth for the company.","James R. Craigie","Bill, yes, I actually do, because I've kind of hinted at it, but I won't give you any details. We have the most incredible new product pipeline ever in our history coming next year. We've always found historically that innovations help drive category growth, and I think that will be a key driver of that next year going forward. So I'm very excited about that. I do think the economy is slightly turning here, but I think more importantly is the new product innovations that we're launching across a lot of key categories will be very, very impactful on the category growth next year.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Matt, just I won't even ask the acquisition question, but at what point is too much cash earning 0.1% on the balance sheet inefficient?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, I'm sure many people who know our story know that, if you went back to year 2000, we had one power brand, that was ARM & HAMMER. And since then, we've added 8 others. Today, we have 9, and that was through acquisitions. And we have proven that once we acquire businesses, we're able to grow their market share pretty rapidly. So with that as a core competency in the company, and, yes, you're right, it's a lot of cash that's building up on the balance sheet. The destinations for that are acquisitions; and number two would be buybacks. And we haven't been a company that's done a lot of buybacks historically. And as I pointed out on our call, we do have $220 million remaining on our authorization. But you're right, Bill, we have lots of cash, but we look at that as an advantage with which to go shopping for new businesses. And the Avid business, we've now owned for a year, we acquired it October 1, 2012. And we've done a great job integrating that business, so we are in good shape right now to take on another one.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","But in terms of just share repurchases or even debt pay-down, there's nothing really you can do on the debt side for the foreseeable future?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","No, the debt side, you're right. We have some commercial paper out there. The reason we have commercial paper out there, while, at the same time, we have cash, is to keep our name in the market such that when we do, do an acquisition, we can avail ourselves of the CP market and keep our name out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to talk a little bit about the promotional environment. And, Jim, can you talk about what you're seeing from a -- let's say, a channel shift standpoint in terms of consumers trading down by channel versus what you're seeing in terms of just a more aggressive promotional standpoint from the companies themselves? And then is there any particular price point -- you guys have lots of different products at all sorts of different price points. Is it more competitive at the lower end, at the high end? Just some sort of comments on that.","James R. Craigie","Yes, John. I really haven't seen anything new in channel shift. There's just the general trends going on over time. That's not really an issue right now. The competitive pricing situation is only occurring in a few key categories right now. Laundry is certainly one of them. We're seeing a bit of pricing pressure in there. But honestly, things have reached a point where I don't think they're going to go any lower. So I think that, that will stabilize itself, and I think you're going to see a lot of innovations in that category next year, so I think that'll actually help drive the category growth back up. So in general, it's been a little bit of a rough time lately, but I think things will definitely improve next year. As I think all competitors will go back to focus more on innovations to drive categories, and I don't think the channel shifting is any more of an issue than it's been in the past.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a follow-up on your comments on laundry. I mean, we have seen, as you mentioned, a huge shift out of the middle of the category, right? So the high end with Tide has gained a little bit of share, but you guys have really gained a ton. How much more share is there available from the middle to your brands there? It's been a big move over the last 4 or 5 years, but there's still a lot in that middle. How much more do you think you can get?","James R. Craigie","A lot. A lot. The middle has been the section that's been kind of eroding for the past decade. There's still quite a bit of share left there. And I think consumers will continue to shift one way or the other to the premium side or to the value side because the middle, you can get the quality of those products with the premium brands, and the value side offers great quality at a great price. So it's been the share donor for a long time, and I think it will continue to be the share donor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Want to talk a little about marketing spend. First, was there a shift from Q3 into Q4? Because if I remember correctly, you guys thought that Q3 would be up. And then how do we think about the spend in marketing versus promotion for 2014?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Olivia. Marketing spending was only lower as a percent of net revenue in the third quarter. We actually spent, on an absolute dollar basis, an additional $7.5 million. And we always assess what we're spending. More importantly, is how we're doing on share growth. And we had a great quarter in the third quarter. We grew share in 7 of our 9 power brands. So we always watch what's going on there. We just -- we always have our hand on the lever because we have to watch competition. I'll remind everybody that Procter & Gamble's announced that they're going to cut over $1 billion of marketing spending going forward. So we watch that. We always stay competitive. But most importantly, what we always gauge our marketing spending against is how we're doing on our share growth. And growing share in 7 of our 9 power brands is a great, great result.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And on the promo versus marketing?","James R. Craigie","Well, no, we always -- that's something where we always -- again, it's -- we consider that all part of marketing, whether it's advertising, consumer coupons or price promotions at the stores. And one of the great jobs of our marketing and sales team is always to gauge how to take the total pot of money we have and most effectively and efficiently deploy it in the marketplace. And I would say we're pretty good masters of that, given our share trends over time. So it's category by category, customer by customer out there, and we just -- we -- one thing about being a small company, and from me on down, we watch that everyday, and we'll shift the levers as needed to, again, most effectively drive the best share results and the best sales results. So we're pretty good against that. It just changes all the time, and that's why we have people in charge of the business and on top of it everyday.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the organic sales growth target of 3% to 4% for next year. How do you think about the mix between volume versus price for next year, particularly considering the big looming February 2014 launch in laundry?","James R. Craigie","Go ahead, Matt.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, as far as the 3% to 4%, historically, the company has been dependent upon volume growth as opposed to price mix. I think it's too early to actually call or split that number between how much is going to be volume and how much is going to be price mix. But suffice to say that if, in fact, the current environment continues, it's possible that it can be some price mix negative. It's certainly in the first half of the year, but we'll update that on the first week of February, when we give our 2014 outlook.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I'd like to explore the vitamin category in a little more detail, if possible. Just from what you've seen so far during your ownership, if you could update on any positive, negative surprises. The shelf space often looks like a big mess when you go into any of the stores, really, depending -- no matter what the format is, a lot of private label. And so just a little more in-depth look at how you see the next few years progressing.","James R. Craigie","Caroline, this category and this business has been everything we dreamed of and then some. As I gave you some numbers before, the gummy side of the business continues to deliver very strong double-digit growth, particularly on the adult side. When we bought the business, the adult category of gummies was only about 3% of the business. So now that's growing rapidly. But still, in total, as I've said, gummy as a part of the total vitamin business, is only about 9% of the total business. So as far as we're concerned, there is 91% of the business to go. The gummy form has such huge advantages, and the taste and all the mouth-feel benefits of it. And I have yet to meet a consumer out there who hasn't tried a gummy, who said [ph] to me, that's the last time they're going to take a hard pill. So we love the business. We're doing a great job of driving distribution gains out there. We've done a great job of driving the cost synergies. We got a lot of new products coming. And the shelves, it's funny you say about the shelves, we kind of share your opinion that the shelves could use some better management out there. Retailers tend to think the shelves are okay. They tend to segment stuff between kids and adults and gummies and this or that and letter vitamins versus multivitamins and that. But we are doing a lot of work to try to help figure it out with the retailers and to try to make it more consumer friendly. But it's a great -- as you know, vitamins, overall, is a great growing category, given the health trends and aging trends not only in our country but around the world. So we are just absolutely thrilled that we bought into this business and bought the hot growing part of this business, so we just see great things going forward.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And just so I understand, given how much private label there is, and a lot of the retailers have strong brand names, that doesn't keep price pressures on you guys? I mean, what's the price mix outlook like?","James R. Craigie","Price mix is -- yes, we have private labels in this category more than others. But we've been able to -- it was part of -- we had a small part of the business we bought that was private label. We've been able to keep it at that range. And I would say, our -- if you look at our product, our product itself has got a fairly decent value positioning in the category, so we feel fine about that. And like any other category, innovations will help drive the category. And certainly, you got a form here, the gummy form versus hard pills. So price pressures are really not a key issue in this category right now.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And then separately, could you say what drove the improvement in Specialty and how sustainable that might be?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","It's pretty simple. The second quarter, you may recall, the weather in the United States was so cool such that the demand for our products completely fell off. The reason for that is, just to remind everybody, our product replaces electrolytes in cows. When it's really hot, cows lose electrolytes through sweat, and they don't make milk. So in the second quarter it was cool, so we -- demand fell off tremendously in our Animal Nutrition business, but that recovered in the third quarter. So it wasn't so much what we did, it was sort of business as usual in Q3.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And then just -- sorry, back to vitamins for a second, do you see this as both a double-digit top line opportunity, as well as bottom line opportunity?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","We -- it's a double-digit top line growth expectation for 2014, for sure.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And bottom line?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","We don't call the P&Ls for the brands or products. We just only comment on top line growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So, Jim, first, on the slight guide down for the year in organic growth, and I know it's modest, but what's worse? And I know that laundry declined sequentially versus 2Q. Is there anything else specifically that you'd call out other than laundry?","James R. Craigie","No, Kevin, laundry is the key call, but we saw this coming. As it kind of started in Q3 and as we expect some continued pressures in Q4, I can't call the future. We'll do whatever we have to do to stay price-competitive. But that was all we see right now. There's -- yes, and everything else is minor at this point in time, but it's -- that's largely it.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you provided guidance now for '13. It looks like it only implies about 1.5% organic growth, which I thought you'd get from Avid alone. So is it fair to say you expect the base business to be flat. Is that fair?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","No, we -- Kevin, it's -- to make judgments about the base business is way premature with respect to 2014.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","No, I'm sorry, Matt, I should have been more clear. This is with respect to 4Q, and your guidance now implies about 1.5% organic growth in 4Q, which I thought you get from Avid now in the base.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, yes, here's another way to think about it. So when we were on the call for -- at the end of the second quarter in August, we said we anticipated pricing pressures in the base business, and they certainly materialized. You saw that in the third quarter with the huge price mix. And although we expect market share gains in Q4, they'll generally be in categories that we expect to be flat or down sequentially compared to Q3. So yes, Q4 on a reported basis for organic is going to be similar to Q3, only this time vitamins is the big driver. So when we said a full year range of 1.5% to 2%, that translates into a pretty big range for the fourth quarter. It'd be more like a 1% to 2.5% range for the fourth quarter to get to a full year range of 1.5% to 2%. So that question is, okay, what's that range dependent upon? It's really a couple things. It's the success of our year-end promotions and our advertising across all categories including vitamins. The second thing is the severity of competitors' price actions. Anybody spending any time in the supermarkets right now has seen that there's tremendous amount of prices being slashed across the board. So yes, it's -- we got a pretty wide range in the fourth quarter, which drives the 1.5% to 2% for the year. But it's those 2 factors, right, it's our year-end promotions and advertising across all the categories and what -- how well would the competitors' pricing actions blunt our actions in the fourth quarter.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jim, speaking with laundry, 2 interesting data points I've picked up from conversations with the folks in the industry. I don't know if you can comment or not or care to, but, first, that you guys are planning on a new product launch with OXI into the premium tier of liquid laundry; and second, that 5 key retailers have indicated they're not going to pick up Procter's new mid-tier-type products, given that the category continues to be in rough shape and that it kind of leaves open the possibility that more dollars come out with the potential for further consumer trade-down. Can you comment on either one of those?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Kevin, I can. But let me just comment that we're fully aware of the launch of the competitive product by Procter & Gamble. I just remind everyone that one of our key success drivers that I've talked about earlier is our ability to successfully defend our brands, as we've done for several years, and as we did when Tide attacked OXICLEAN a few years ago. And for competitive reasons, we're not going to reveal the details of what I would call a ferocious defense that we're going to mount next year. But I also remind everybody, as it often happens in battles like this, it's the weaker players in the categories that are usually the losers, and that's exactly what happened when OXICLEAN was attacked by Tide. Tide has gained some share, but OXICLEAN also gained share, and the share gains that both those brands achieved came out of the weaker brands. So I think that's kind of the forecast I see for next year, but I don't want to reveal what we're going to do, and it's just going to be -- just trust us that we have a long history and a good track record of defending our brands, and we look forward to a good battle.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The CapEx budgets, so it seems like you spent $30 million year-to-date, and there's like a $40 million expected investment in the fourth quarter. What's the big step-up for?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, it's not so much a big step-up, Bill, as timing. We entered the year, we thought we were going to spend an excess of $80 million. And we've only gotten through $30 million of it through the first 3 quarters of the year. So if you've ever worked in a manufacturing organization, you sort of use it or lose it, right? So you got a lot of guys trying to get their projects get completed in the fourth quarter. So it's no one large project we can point to. It's lots and lots of little ones across all the plants.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. But would be surprised if it came in below $70 million?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","No, I think it'll be -- I think $70 million is about right. Because remember -- if you remember in August, Bill, we were calling $80 million, so now we knocked it down to $70 million.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I just thought $40 million, I mean, it seems like a lot of money to spend in 3 months.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, it is.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then what's the end game in laundry here? Because like you look at some of the price per unit numbers from Nielsen and like guys are taking like 10%, 11%, 8% price decreases. And then obviously, you have to follow there. So like how does this whole thing end? Because volume is not improving. It's actually -- just continues to be flat.","James R. Craigie","Bill, I personally think 2013 is a year more of pricing pressures and things like that. I think 2014 is going to be a year of innovation. And I think forward, I think consumers will respond to that and look at the innovations that are going to come out across the category. And I think things will get better. I think it will. Just there wasn't that much in the pipeline from a lot of us this year as far as really, truly innovative product. I think you will see more of that next year.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And your competitors, I mean, what are they telling the trade when they take like an 8% or 9% price decrease? And then why would the trade want to accept that if it's just going to shrink the category because the volume is not responding?","James R. Craigie","That's a good question, Bill. I think you should ask the retailers that.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. And then in cat litter, shares are still a bit soft. It seems like you guys are starting a price war there at least in the last couple months. I mean, what's the turnaround plan there?","James R. Craigie","Bring new product innovations.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But in the short term, is there going to be like a pretty aggressive pricing environment?","James R. Craigie","No, no, no. Bill, I would tell you, we've never tried to start a price war. We only respond to what's going on out there, and there's been some pretty competitive activity out there. But we have no desire to do that, but we will always do what's necessary to keep our brands competitive. But you're going to see something really big from us next year. We have historically launched a new product every 2 years. We did one -- so next year would be the year to launch a big new product. And this year, we did not have a big new product for our usual schedule, and some activity took on that kind of caught us by surprise, and so we've had to deal with that. But next year, we'll go back to what's always been successful for us, which is kind of a long history of success in this category, which is a big new product innovation coming out of Church & Dwight.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then I didn't catch the answer, but the reason for not buying back stock in the fourth quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Why would we want to buy back stock in the fourth quarter?","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Why aren't you going to buy back stock in the fourth quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, we have an authorization. We've chosen not to. That's a decision we look at every quarter. The management and the board discuss it, and we've opted not to. So we do have a lot of ability to buy back shares next year, and we certainly have the balance sheet to do it.","James R. Craigie","Okay, don't be a pig, Bill. We gave you 4 [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess I just want to make sure I understand the Q4 sales outlook. Like I hear you, that response to your marketing plan -- those competitive marketing plans matter, but I guess that's always the case. But your outlook for Q4 does -- like it's 0.5 point to 2.5 points of growth implied by the full year. It does seem to imply sequential business slowdown, especially like in light of the fact that maybe your ferocious defense could be starting in that quarter. So I guess I want to understand how you're thinking about it.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, no, you're right. The -- as I said before that the -- if you have a full year range of 1.5% to 2%, that means that the range for the fourth quarter is going to be pretty wide, like 1% to 2.5%. So there's a lot of room in there for success or failure of our promotions with respect to the competition. And I would say it has gotten sequentially more difficult, Chris, as far as if you look at Q3 versus Q4 and what's going on on-shelf. So we recognize that, so we'd have a pretty wide range in there for the fourth quarter.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I guess, back to the Tide, simply, launch, I mean, I know you don't want to divulge too much on your defense plans, but you got into the high end of your 3% to 4% for the year. It really doesn't sound like you're terribly concerned about what's going on there. I just was wondering if you could just give a little color on your thoughts. And is that right or you just think that other businesses are going to take the lead from a growth perspective next year?","James R. Craigie","No, no. I don't take anything lightly from the Procter & Gamble company. It's a major initiative by then -- them. We -- so like I said, we're -- we have a quite strong record of ferocious defense. We've taken them out in the past when they attacked OXICLEAN head on. And again, I would just remind you the end game. When 2 big players go to battle like this, and we'll do similar to what we did with the OXICLEAN defense, with the innovative new products, increased marketing spending, increased support, overall, often, the end result is, with us or Procter, Coke and Pepsi is -- usually, it's the other players who take the hit because the 2 guys going head-to-head often end up both winning, and the other smaller competitors often end up losing. So I'm all pleased. Believe me, I take this absolutely seriously. We've been all over this for months, and I feel very confident, though, that what we'll announce to you next year will delight you. And we'll do what we need to do to deliver what we're calling as organic growth at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, with laundry being a key player of that.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I guess one last one. Just on that OXI defense, obviously, that was very successful, but that was Procter coming into a category where they didn't have much of an equity. Now they're swimming downstream, where they do have a pretty strong equity. And I guess you just haven't seen too many examples of that in these categories. And I guess, how are you thinking about that dynamic? I know you're viewing maybe the OXI example as informative, but I'm just wondering what the differences are in that you have a bigger brand but in -- with an actual equity in the category swimming downstream?","James R. Craigie","I wouldn't say Procter has no equity in the laundry additive category. Well, Procter is the giant in the overall laundry business, with products in almost every segment, and they entered that category with the Tide name, which is an incredibly powerful brand. So I consider it a very strong analogy to what's going on here. And yes, this laundry detergent, there's a lot of brands in there, but they're obviously ahead of that category also, but we're the strong #2. And again, the best way to fight that is to go out with innovative new products and increase marketing spending and have at it. And I feel confident that what we're going to do next year will deliver those results we need to deliver the kind of business results we're going to tell you about in February.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Another question on detergents. Is the increased promotional activity in detergents coming mainly from your biggest competitor above you or from the other 2 players or equally from everybody?","James R. Craigie","Sort of the latter, Alice, but it's all in different formats. The other competitors are mostly doing price. The big dog is mostly flooding the market with coupons. So it's been from all angles and that. So it's a bit of a war going on right now, but our share -- we're hanging in there pretty well. Our share growth is at record levels in Q3. And I just -- we know how to fight those kind of wars, and we'll do what's right to defend our brand.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","We know that Procter has got a bunch of innovations coming in detergents, and you apparently do. Do you know if the other players have innovation coming, too, or are they going to keep fighting on price?","James R. Craigie","I don't know that, Alice. I don't -- I can't comment on that.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then some housekeeping stuff. Can we expect gross margins again to be up in 2014?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","We're not going to comment on that until the first week of February, Alice.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","All right. And then the other one is Avid. You said you -- for sure, it will grow double digits next year. Are you more comfortable with the number closer to 10% or closer to 20%? I'm trying to figure out how fast that double-digit momentum is.","James R. Craigie","Alice, I just won 2 bets about you. Keep going.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, well, it's not 99, Alice. It's double-digit, that's all we're going to say.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","All right. But I mean, is it just barely double digits or is it something stronger than that?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, I commend you for your persistence. We're going to -- you can see in the Nielsen data how this category has been growing and the fact that it's...","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes, but that's not very complete data, so...","James R. Craigie","Well, Alice, we invite you to the CAGNY event next February in Florida.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","How fast is Avid growing, overall, at this point, including all channels?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, I mean, on a pro forma basis, it would be growing in the 20s. So if you looked at 2012 versus '13, assuming we owned it in '12, it would be in the 20s.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Including in the third quarter, not just year-to-date?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","That's right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Steib from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have a couple of questions on costs. First, relating to commodity costs, it was flat in the quarter. What's your outlook, and how much visibility do you have as you enter 2014? And then secondly, have you realized all the cost savings now from the Avid acquisition?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, with respect to commodities, Michael, we have 8 commodities that represent -- that are our most volatile commodities. And we typically look at what percentage of those are hedged going into the coming year. And right now, we're about 30% hedged. Some of those commodities would include everything from resin to diesel, soda ash, paper products, palm fatty acid distillate, et cetera. So as far as Avid goes, and we have -- we -- when we bought that business, we said we saw $15 million of cost synergies. That number is going to be higher. We just don't update numbers like that after an acquisition. The way the $15 million split was $6 million of SG&A and $9 million of cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold numbers are certainly going to be higher. So -- and we're making really good progress with respect to expanding gross margin on that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","For 2014, you didn't guide the EPS growth despite the top line guidance. Why is that? Are you still comfortable, conceptually, that double-digit earnings growth is the right range longer-term as you look out to 2014 and beyond?","James R. Craigie","No, we just don't normally give a forecast at this point in time. And we're still dotting the Is and crossing the Ts in our planning process. So we've always historically done that when we come out to the CAGNY meeting in 2014.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Because last year at this time you've given it, so I was wondering what the difference was versus last year.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, last year at this time, you may recall, we had just acquired the Avid business, so a lot of interest in how much we thought the Avid business is going to contribute to 2013. So we gave some people -- so we felt like -- obligated to call a number for the year at 14%, and that's where we're coming into, by the way.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then for 2013 earnings guidance, I guess I'm a bit confused why your earnings guidance isn't moving up. The tax rate's more favorable. Gross margins are coming in at the higher end of your range. Should we think about organic sales growth as maybe at the low end of your new range, or is it conservatism, or something else that's offsetting those favorable factors?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. Well, look, there's always a lot of moving parts in the P&L. And we were calling 2% organic growth up until this call. Now we're seeing 1.5% to 2%. So obviously, there's some earnings impact as a result of that, so there's some room there. As far as taxes goes, we got the benefit of a lower tax rate already in the first and second quarter. We're at 34% Q1, 34.5% in Q2. We stuck at 35% midyear because we were anticipating some things to happen in the second half but didn't. So then we posted the 34% again in Q3, so the whole year is going to be about 34%. So it's not like we'd kind of woke up to the entire benefit in the fourth quarter of a tax rate change, it's just that we came down off the number today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a question about your gross margin and, Jim, the comments you were making at the beginning about how you pay your people partly on gross margin. Can you give us a sense, kind of what the range of gross margins are? You don't even have to tell me what detergents are versus vitamins specifically, but kind of within the company helping a range of gross margins there are, because I'm trying to get a feel for how much some of the negative pricing you're doing might be hurting your gross margins versus favorable mix is boosting your gross margins.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, the only thing we've said historically with respect to that question is this is -- kind of a walking around number, that will be 20-margin-points difference between an average household versus average personal care, personal care being higher.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And so kind of as you think out over the next -- forget about next year, but kind of over next 3 to 5 years, I mean, you've been -- obviously, you've made huge improvements over the last 4 quarters. But over the last 3 years, you've been kind of in that 44 range. I mean, do you think that, with the benefit of favorable mix, you can break out sustainably and more consistently to sort of a 45, 46, 47 type number? Or what are you thinking about in terms of motivating people internally? Or is that hard to come by?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. Well, look, the things that move our gross margin is several things. One is new products, right, so new products that we launch are typically going to be higher than the brand average. So that's a mover within the business. And obviously, people are incented to develop products with higher gross margins. The second thing, you're correct, the personal care has been a bit of a drag at least certainly in the third quarter, x the Vitamin business, and that's the higher margin stuff. So that's the side of the business we would need to get rolling on a consistent basis because we've had some fits and starts over the last year or 2, where we were growing and then we were not growing. The third thing is acquisitions. So the acquisitions that we buy, typically, are gross margin accretive. That wasn't true for Avid because when we bought them, they had a 38% gross margin. But we did say that, over time, we expect to get that to corporate gross margins, and we're still committed to that. And so that's going to help us as well as we come up the line on that one. So it's new products, it's personal care improvement, and it's acquisitions. And finally, the most important thing in recent history is our good-to-great program, so our continuous improvement program. So think about the third quarter, where you have a huge negative price mix, and, at the same time, you're expanding your gross margin, and it's really remarkable. And the way this program works is we're always looking ahead the next 2 to 3 years where we can debottleneck plants and change formulations, negotiate with suppliers, through CapEx, automate our manufacturing processes such that we can reduce the cost per unit of our products. So that is central to our gross margin strategy going forward.","James R. Craigie","Yes, let me just jump in and say too, that, that's why 25% of every employee in this company's bonus is based on hitting the gross margin target. So that has been a major change in the culture of this company going back about over 5, 6 years. And I think everybody in this company has been talking gross margin, and that's how it really -- it really pays off when that happens. So that's how we keep getting all these improvements and gross margins. It's been a terrific result.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just want to go back to Avid for a second and try to tease out the growth for next year. I mean, obviously, you got a nice tailwind from market growth. But you also, I thought, when you bought it, it had a fair amount of innovation that was still in the pipeline that haven't come forward yet. And also, you had a nice distribution opportunity as well. So can you kind of just update us on what's going on in both of those fronts?","James R. Craigie","Joe, yes, we do have a lot of new products come in. The distribution gains happened over the course of the year, so we'll get a full year benefit in the next year. There's more distribution gains to come. We're still not where we want to be on that. So there's a lot of upside there. And just always keep in mind that gummy vitamins as a whole business, a whole category, is only 9% of the total vitamin category but growing about 5x to 6x the rate. So there's tremendous upside left for the gummy vitamins out there. The retailers see it, they're supporting it. The sampling, which we're driving hard, that's the best way to get people to understand the whole -- we do -- we've more than doubled the advertising on the business, but the sampling is crucial. When somebody tastes the gummy, they just can't believe that the vitamin -- the same vitamin nutrient as a hard pill is on the gummy that tastes so great. So we're just going to keep pounding that. We've got a tiger by the tail here, and we're going to do everything from increased marketing spending, new product innovations, increased distribution, increased sampling. We're just going to keep pounding it and delivering double-digit growth.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Where's the biggest opportunity for distribution expansion in '14?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Still the traditional food channel because that's the -- not only because the prior owners of the business literally didn't have the arms and legs to calm that channel, we do, so we're in there big time doing that. But there's other distribution opportunities in other channels too, but the biggest difference versus where we want to be, I would say, is still in the traditional food stores.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just switching gears a little bit, I guess, for you, Matt. In terms of the organic growth, you mentioned 1% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter, and then 4-ish for next year. And that's sort of a like-for-like number in the sense that it's got Avid in both periods. So I'm just curious if you can just kind of bridge the gap between the 1.5 -- the 1% and 2.5% this quarter and the 4% next year. I mean, it sounds like you're assuming some moderation in promotional activity and some new products, as well, driving that.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, well, it's -- the new product introductions are the biggest factor. Well, we can't -- we won't talk about those until the first week of February. We still have vitamin growth next year. And we have the improvement in the cyclical Specialty Products business. So remember that business collapsed in the second quarter from a volume standpoint and, by itself, took our full year down by 50 basis points from an organic standpoint. So that will come back as well. But it's really those 3 factors: new products, vitamin growth and improvement in the cyclical Specialty Products business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions. First thing is the implied increase in marketing spending in the second half is actually really -- it's quite large. So could you talk maybe a little bit more about the promotional aspects. I just want to make sure I'm correct that you're also planning a pretty significant increase in more advertising-type marketing spending.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, in the fourth quarter, Lauren?","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, that's true. That's the plan right now.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that's not necessarily against new products, it's just sort of another way to combat the environment, perhaps, a little bit higher quality than just for pure promotion.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Right. It's -- again, we continue to support the brands, and we can't -- it's not going to -- the battle won't be fought completely with respect to price.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the second thing was just, Jim, I was struck by your sort of, for you especially, relative optimism about the sort of competitive and consumer environment for next year and also by the fact that you commented on like innovation being the key, addressing [ph] almost if the innovation hadn't been that interesting this year. It just -- it didn't really feel like consistent with how you spoke about innovation from Church & Dwight at the start of the year. You had the laundry compaction. There was a lot of exciting stuff at that stock exchange meeting. So I mean, is it really just a similar year in terms of innovation? Are you more optimistic about how it plays out in the market? Or I don't know, it just seemed like a little bit different, for you especially.","James R. Craigie","No, Lauren, it's just a relative thing. We had a good pipeline of new products this year. It's just next year, by far, will be the biggest amount of new product launches we've ever had. And like I said earlier in a question, we -- as planned, we didn't have a new cat litter product planned for this year. We will have a big one planned for next year. Laundry will be doing things next year that we would normally be doing, plus maybe a little more because of some of the competitive activities going on. And the other categories, too, all really have some terrific stuff. I just don't want to tip my hat right now on some of the things we're doing, but when you see the first week of February, you will see -- well, we've always had good new product innovations in the past years. This will blow your mind next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leigh Ferst from Wellington Shields.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","I also had a question about Avid distribution. Can you tell us what gains you've made so far and if you are where you want to be in terms of how you planned it for the last year?","James R. Craigie","Obviously, I'm not going to go into specific detail. Obviously, we've had significant distribution gains so far across almost every -- across every channel, period. And -- but I would still say there's a lot more to go. And if so, we've got our sales force every day is cracking accounts out there. See, what happens is accounts don't all make their decisions on the same day every year. Throughout the whole year, accounts -- some accounts make decisions on distribution in the first quarter, some in the second quarter, some in the third quarter, some in the fourth quarter. And so we just -- we have to go with that timing. And so our sales force is doing these accounts constantly out there, so we've had success over every quarter this year. We -- And I think we'll be able to have a lot more success going forward. All I'll tell you is there's some accounts out there that are close to where we want to be in distribution, but the large majority aren't, and we want to all get them there. And then we have a great new product pipeline coming, so great success in 2013, but still a long ways to go in 2014 and beyond.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay, and you mentioned in your comments that you have achieved distribution to offset some out of stocks in certain brands. Can you give us any more detail on that?","James R. Craigie","No, I think I made the point that our sales force -- we -- our shares are like steadily growing in laundry. It's up 50% in the past 5 years. And when you have that kind of share growth, you need more shelf -- space on the shelves to keep up, otherwise, you'll be out of stock. And that's where our sales force has done a great job. I was going out there and going over those numbers with the retailers. The retailers, yes, they see that. They realize they need to give us more shelf space or they will have out of stock. So it's been a big, big benefit to us, but we've had a big gain in distribution in a lot of categories this year to hopefully minimize the out-of-stock situation. So don't walk away thinking that out of stock has been a significant problem for us. It's not because our sales force has done a great job of getting increased distribution. And all the categories, we had great share growth.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And you had a great track record making acquisitions. It sounds like you want to make another one, but, obviously, it takes 2 to tango. Will you be able to achieve your goals next year without an acquisition if, for any reason, you're not able to consummate one?","James R. Craigie","Yes. With the goals to be announced in February, well, it will not be based at all on an acquisition. We never do that. In the course of the year, we make an acquisition, we'll update the information, but we don't ever base our annual plan on making -- hoping to make an acquisition because you just can't -- you can't guarantee that.","Operator","Our last question comes from Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was hoping you would comment on the impact of compaction. Initially, when you launched ARM & HAMMER, the new concentrated version, you put it on store shelves next to the regular strength. I'm wondering if the shelf space has migrated entirely to the compacted version, if competitors have followed, as they did on the first round, and whether or not the increased profitability that comes out of a concentration like this has been funding a lot of the increased promotional activity.","James R. Craigie","I'll try to answer those 27 questions. No, I think this -- the compacted form of ARM & HAMMER, we call it 4X or Ultra Power, it's done very well this year. I think I said 70% of the share growth that ARM & HAMMER achieved in the third quarter came from that product. It's out there doing very well. Nobody has followed it yet -- but I'd say yet -- out there, but it's doing very well. We're very happy with it. It has not -- we regained distribution far beyond that product in the laundry category last year. So it was not the only gainer. And the product saw a nice contribution to us on sales and profits, but it wasn't the source from which we sourced any money for promotion dollars in that. So just overall, it's a good new product for us. We're very happy with it. Obviously, going forward, strongly, I would wish my competitors would take a closer look at that, but we'll see. I can't -- I can only control what we do, and I'm very happy with the success we've had with that product.","Okay, everybody, I want to thank you very much for participating in the call today on a Friday.

See the Appendix in this morning's press release for a reconciliation.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll provide some color on the quarter, and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO.","And when Rick is finished, we'll have a Q&A session. We're happy with our organic sales growth of 1.8%. This was in line with our Q2 outlook of approximately 1% to 2%. The 1.8% organic growth was driven by continued strong performance from international consumer business and a return to growth in our Specialty Products business.","We have delivered strong first half results and are on track to achieve 3% full-year organic sales growth and 8.5% earnings growth. In the domestic business, market share gains and 6% volume growth reflect the investments made in the quarter. We expected the domestics business to grow less than 1% in Q2, as we increased our trade and promotional spend.","Our targeted investment spending translated into share growth as 6 out of 10 power brands exceeded or met category growth. Most important, we succeeded in promoting trial for our new product introductions, which makes us positive about our second half organic sales growth.","Our international consumer business exceeded our expectations with 7.4% organic growth. The increase was driven primarily by the export business and strong quarters from Mexico and Australia. We continued to invest in our international consumer business to sustain our strong sales growth. Last year, you may remember we opened new offices in Singapore and Panama to support our export business, and then a few weeks ago, we established a new subsidiary in Germany to expand our European business.","Our Specialty Products business had a strong quarter with 9.4% organic growth. The dairy economy is healthy with class III milk prices around $16.50 compared to an average last year of around $15. We're starting to get more traction outside of dairy in poultry and cattle, and in fact a few weeks ago, I visited our new employees at Agro BioSciences in Wisconsin which is the custom probiotics business that we recently acquired and I walked away more excited than ever about the future growth of that business.","Turning now to some of our categories and new product launches, the laundry category grew 1.5% in Q2. Our laundry business grew over 9% in consumption. This past quarter we leveled the playing field and increased our trade promotions and couponing to be in line with our competitors. A chunk of the incremental investment was to promote trial of our new product introductions which are the Triple Chamber unit dose and the restage of OXI laundry detergent.","We had high promotional effectiveness and we are the only major manufacturer to grow share in the quarter. And once again, ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent grew share for the 30th consecutive quarter. We restaged our OXICLEAN laundry detergent and gained share in Q2 with improved efficacy, claims and packaging. So we've given OXICLEAN laundry detergent a boost with a great new formula that we wanted consumers to try, so generating trial was our objective.","And finally unit dose, behind our strong Triple Chamber innovation, our unit dose consumption has grown two times the category rate for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our total unit dose share now including OXICLEAN is at 4.2%.","In litter, the clumping litter category grew 3.4% and ARM & HAMMER consumption grew 6%. So we gained share. Our new litter innovation SLIDE has already reached a 4% share of the clumping litter segment and we grew share 60 basis points in the quarter. Of the 13 new launches in the litter category over the past six years, SLIDE ranks number one in repeats after six months in the marketplace. So we feel good about the future of that product.","The dry shampoo category grew 33% in Q2. The dry shampoo category is now $130 million in the U.S. BATISTE grew 9.6% to a 31% share. BATISTE has the strongest brand loyalty of any dry shampoo in the category, including brands with significant hair care heritage, with nearly 75% of BATISTE users using the brand most often versus the competition.","Now turning to gummies. The gummy category grew 13% but our vitamin business was flat for the quarter. VITAFUSION, which is our adult gummy business is contending with significant competitive discounting, so there is lots of BOGOs going on in gummy vitamins, we haven't been engaging in that, so that's been hurting our business.","The condom category declined in consumption by 3% in the quarter. TROJAN Condom share in measured channels was down 150 basis points. Although some of that is offset by online consumption, condom consumption all channels has been soft for the last few quarters. Our research suggests that young people are having less sex, some of the factors are demographics, young people living at home longer, and surprisingly the distraction of mobile phone usage.","So, innovation is always a catalyst to category growth. Our new XOXO condom, which is geared toward women is going extremely well. We're focusing XOXO and our TROJAN advertising on digital to try to get the young people to spend less time on their phones and more time using TROJAN condoms.","On the acquisition front, we recently announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Water Pik located in Fort Collins, Colorado. It's another great business. They're the market leader in Water Jet technology in both oral water flossers and showerheads. Water Pik will be our 11th power brand, and this transaction which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions is expected to close in the third quarter.","Next up is Rick to give you some details on Q2 results and the outlook for the rest of the year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Matt and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 per share compared to $0.43 in 2016, down 4.7% after excluding a $0.12 per share charge related to the previously announced UK pension settlement. The $0.41 was better than our $0.37 outlook, largely due to our better margins in international and SPD business, some help from tax, slightly higher sales and lower SG&A spending. Reported revenues were up 2.3% to $898 million, organic sales were 1.8%, at the high end of our 1% to 2% range. Organic sales growth was driven by our international consumer business, and our SPD division.","Now, let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales were flat as couponing and promotional investments impacted net sales growth. Growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergents, OXICLEAN laundry detergent and stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was offset by declines in XTRA laundry detergent, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kits and TROJAN condoms. We expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2% for the Consumer Domestic business.","International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by FEMFRESH and BATISTE in the export business and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, STERIMAR, OXICLEAN stain-fighter in Mexico and BATISTE, VMS and FEMFRESH in Australia. So, just broad based growth across the globe. We now expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 7% for the international business.","For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 9.4%, due to higher volumes in the animal productivity business. Milk prices and U.S. dairy farm profitability remain at a higher level than a year ago. We are raising our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 2% to 3% to up approximately 6%.","Turning now to gross margin. Our adjusted second quarter gross margin was 45.7%, an 80-basis point decrease from a year ago. This was a bit better than we'd originally expected, largely due to continued productivity improvements and better margin on the international and SPD side. The Q2 gross margin decline breaks out as follows. We had higher promotional levels in Q2, which resulted in a drag of 180 basis points, gross margin improvement of 70 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures, and productivity net of commodities was worth about 30 basis points of improvement.","Moving now to marketing. Marketing as a percent of revenue hit a recent high of 14.6%. Remember, at the beginning of the year, we said that we were beefing up Q2 marketing. Historically, big quarters were Q2 and Q4, this year Q2 and Q3 to better support innovation. SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.4%, a 460-basis point increase primarily due to the UK pension settlement. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 13% \u2013 was 13% of sales up 20 basis points, primarily due to increased amortization from acquisitions.","Now to operating profit. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.1%, which was 190 basis points lower than the prior year, largely due to the marketing shift and higher promotional spending. Other expense was $6.4 million, primarily driven by $9.5 million of interest.","Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% on an adjusted basis. Turning to cash, we generated approximately $250 million of net cash for the first half, a $47 million decrease from the prior year, largely due to working capital, which was a function of a $30 million increase in deferred incentive comp plus higher inventories. This was partially offset by higher cash earnings.","So, in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include strong share growth driven by our investments in our domestic business, continued strong growth in international and a return to growth in our Specialty Products segment.","Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect Q3 organic sales growth of 3.5% which reflects the consumer domestic business growing at approximately 3%. Just a remainder 2016 growth was heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, therefore the second half of 2017 will benefit from easier comps. On a two-year stack basis, the first and second half are consistent at around 5%. Gross margin is expected to contract in Q3 with increased levels of promotion and coupon investments. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be significantly higher year-over-year, with the shift from Q4 to Q3 to continue our innovation support. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.46, compared to $0.47 a year ago, or a 2% decrease year-over-year, which includes $0.02 of dilution from the Water Pik acquisition.","The primary drivers of the decrease are higher marketing in support of our new product launches and higher consumer promotional spending. As we end the year, we expect strong earnings growth in Q4, as heavy coupons around new product trial peels off, and the marketing goes back to normal levels. And now, turning to the full year, and as I go through these metrics please keep in mind that we are excluding any impact from Water Pik. We're maintaining our expectations for organic sales growth of 3%, we maintain our gross margin improvement guidance of 40 bps improvement year-over-year. Our full-year marketing expectations is approximately 12% of sales consistent with prior years.","Operating margin expansion of 30 basis points improvement, when adjusted for the pension and Brazilian charges. Other expense is expected to be around $31 million, primarily driven by interest expense, which does not include any interest expense from the Water Pik acquisition. And the tax rate is expected to be around 33%.","On a reported basis, we continue to expect EPS to be $1.79, which includes the $0.01 negative impact from the Brazil charge and a $0.12 negative impact from the pension settlement and no impact from the Water Pik acquisition. Excluding those items, we expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth or $1.92 per share. And as mentioned previously for the full-year, we expect no net impact from the Water Pik acquisition.","To wrap up, we expect approximately $605 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $45 million of CapEx for the full year. This represents an excess of 120% free cash flow conversion.","We also have some good news on the pension settlement front. We were able to beat our original expectations of settlement costs and we have no further pension risk or volatility to worry about as a company.","So now Matt and I will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, two questions. First, I was just hoping we could discuss the promotional levels in the quarter a bit more. The domestic consumer business obviously price mix is down significantly by 6%. It seems like it's kind of a unprecedented level of promotional spending. So I just wanted to understand better the decision making behind that large a magnitude of higher spend or lower price and how much of that continues or lingers going forward?","And has something changed here longer-term in terms of the competitive spending levels that's necessary or sort of the cost of doing business in the industry? Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question. I wouldn't look at that as a sea change at all Dara. I think, if you looked at historical numbers, you would see for us that we were actually on more on the sidelines when it came to the amount that we promoted on products, particularly in laundry. So, but we had two new innovations this past quarter, the Triple Chamber and also the OXICLEAN restage. So, we wanted to get behind those in a significant way, which is what we did in order to promote trial. And in my remarks, I said we had very high promotional effectiveness and what that means is that you're able to steal share from other brands to your brand as a result of your promotion. So, that's a good measure of whether or not they're effective, but you can't keep that up forever. You do that to promote trial, and the expectation is that you're going to get repurchase in the second half. So, it's \u2013 I wouldn't view it as a sea change.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that Dara is, of the 600-basis point drag on a price mix perspective, about a third of that was to drive new products and trial. So, again it's not going to repeat forever.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And it seems like you're pretty happy from a market share standpoint, yet sort of the overall level of growth and top-line growth in the consumer domestic business is pretty muted versus history for you guys. So, it implies that category environment is much more difficult in terms of growth we're seeing in the U.S. industry. Just was hoping for your perspective on that, is that just the competitive environment, or do you think there are broader issues with fragmenting consumer demand and perhaps the younger generation having different priorities as you touched on earlier in the condom business. So, just any perspective on what's been driving this slowdown in U.S. category growth and if you think it's more temporary or longer term in nature would be helpful?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'll let Matt talk about a macro perspective but for us it's also some of the comps Dara. In the first half of 2016 we as a company grew 4%. And so, in the first half of this year, it's around 2%. So it's the inverse of that in the second half, we grew at about around 2% in 2016, and 4% is our expectation in 2017. So a couple of our big categories like vitamin and laundry, that's what the comps are for the prior year.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. From a macro standpoint, you may remember at the beginning of the year, we said that our expectation was that categories would grow 1.5% to 2%. So what we do is we take a look at all of our categories weighted, and so our categories weighted, it would be around 1.5% growth in the second quarter. So it's on the lower end of that, Dara, I'd say that there are certain personal care categories in particular that are somewhat depressed. So if you look at categories like the depilatories, oral analgesics, condoms, kits, battery-operated toothbrushes, all of those categories, those categories were down in Q2, year-over-year. So and again there's discounting across all categories. So that's one of the contributing factors to that.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And is that something you think lingers more longer term as you look out to 2018 more temporary, just general thoughts on that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, I think these things can be lumpy. I'd say that the condom thing has been more lingering, as my remarks were in the last few quarters, it seems like people are having less sex. And there's less condom usage, we've done some work around that, that could be with us going forward. But I wouldn't be alarmed about the other personal care categories just yet.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","So question on the guidance. Just wanted to make sure I was clear in terms of how the year is progressing here. So it seems like international momentum continues. That's now expected to be a little bit better. Specialty looks like it's going to be considerably better and consumer domestic a bit worse. And then to bring this back to the EPS guidance, it looks like on an FX neutral basis that comes down by about a point. So Matt, is that just around \u2013 is it higher investment levels than you anticipated? I think, category growth maybe slowed half a point, maybe a function of mix with personal care probably not coming in quite where you expected year-to-date and that being a higher margin than the household side. So just \u2013 can you maybe quantify a bit that point that came down on the FX neutral guide?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'll take that, Kevin. It's a couple of things, really. You're right. Domestic, we brought down slightly. Personal care in the front half was negative in the quarter especially, but we believe that's going to turnaround because of the comps and other category growth in the back half. So we feel good about that. To the degree that we get any benefits from FX, remember we're typically spending that back. So to be blunt, our marketing line will probably go up slightly versus our previous expectations. We're not changing anything. So we just reinvest that if we need to. So I guess, that's a short answer.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's kind of what I had figured. Just one follow-up from me and then I'll pass it on. Just getting back to the promotional intensity in laundry, and it seems like Procter ramped its level of trade spend pretty significantly through mid July. Matt, would you care to comment on what you saw in the back half of July? Did you see that level continue? You guys obviously ramped pretty considerably. What's sort of the expectation with respect to laundry here for the balance of the year and do you have enough in the guidance to sort of combat any level, should it remain this elevated? Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, I'll take the first part maybe. P&G and everybody always continues to, it's a promotional category, laundry is always a promotional category. But in the long term, if you take a step back, what's happening at the end of the day, the premium tier usually wins with innovation and the value tier wins because of value and the mid-tier shrinks. I would say that's no different than what's been happening for the last 52 weeks, 26 weeks and 13 weeks. And so, if they promote a little bit more, that's usually the higher end.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, to answer your question, Kevin. As far as July goes yeah. I mean if you talk to Lou and our sales guys, you'll see that things have heated up with some of the other brands, but we always expect the worst. So, I would say that that's in our guidance, we always expect it's going to be tougher in the second half, especially after we took things up in the Q2.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Powers with UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Just to, I guess press on that a little bit. The laundry couponing obviously you just said it was targeted at new products. But we also saw significant activity around the core ARM & HAMMER brand. In the whole category it looks like volumes accelerated led by your brands. And I guess out of that a few questions. So just \u2013 I just want a little bit more color on why be so aggressive, so broadly aggressive at a time when everyone's kind of on pins and needles with respect to this category in particular with the Henkel change and what P&G is doing and it just \u2013 it feels like the risk of provoking a continued cycle of retaliation is especially high, so just some color there? And then your confidence that the trial you've generated will translate to repeat once the couponing subsides? And lastly, just your sense of the pantry inventory you may have created, just because again it feels like the volumes sold this past quarter likely outpaced consumption by a fair degree?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, okay. So, I've got three questions here. I'll take the first one. Really, it's all relative to your perspective, Steve. I mean for us, we aren't outspending the competition, and I'll give you a couple of facts. For the quarter, our amount sold on deal for laundry detergent was 36%. On average the category was 35%.","For couponing, this is more of a limited measurement, but our data says we're around 30% and the category is around 27%, 28%. So, maybe we're a basis point two or higher. For a long time, we've kind of held back, but I think we are not making the situation worse, we're just getting up to par with our competition.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, and the other question Steve. So, we have unit dose and we have OXICLEAN restage. So, I mentioned, our promotional effectiveness is an important measure as to whether or not your efforts are working. So, we expect that we're going to \u2013 it's a little early to tell now, but we do expect that we're going to get some repeat purchases in the second half for OXICLEAN laundry detergent. And remember on unit dose, which is the Triple Chamber, we are the only value detergent, only value unit dose that's out there. So, we have an advantage, so to the extent that we get people to trial the unit dose our research tells us that people, it will stick. And if you noticed that our unit dose share grew 40 basis points in the quarter and we've been growing twice as fast as the category, the unit dose category for the past five quarters. So, we've juiced that a little bit. And so we want to accelerate the stealing consumers and bringing them over to our ARM & HAMMER unit dose, particularly the Triple Chamber.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough, fair enough. And I if I could just squeeze in one question unrelated just on the new subsidiary in Germany, just some color there. It's obviously a large market, but it's also historically been pretty tough at least a tough one in which to make some money. So, just your approach to targeting Germany?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well. Look the \u2013 we have a subsidiary in the UK and one in France. So we have \u2013 and then and that's it in Europe. And all the other countries we served through distributors historically. Germany was unique in our minds because it is the largest economy in Europe and strongest economy in Europe in a well. And so we felt that's a place that we should be. So, that was the logic behind it. And obviously, we do have sales into Germany today through distributors, so, we have a base of sales in Germany. So, we are not going in with a donut. But we do think that that our brands are going to resonate there, and we're going to be able to generate some sales growth there.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. First of all, could you talk a little bit \u2013 you mentioned specific of the e-commerce growth in the release, but talk a little bit about e-commerce what you're kind of doing proactively strategically to do that. Primary retailers where you're sourcing that growth, and then also same kind of conversation around club and the performance there?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. We're working with all of our retailers on their dot com sales. So we have \u2013 we took somebody, one of our more senior people in the company and dedicated her to working with all of our retailers to drive their online sales. And obviously, we have a structure behind her as well. Amazon is the big dog, I'm sure that's true for virtually every CPG company. So we continue to grow with them, but Wal-Mart you probably know this more recently started in-store pickup or experimenting with in-store pickup, online ordering and in-store pickup on the East Coast. So it's kind of a wait and see to see how that's going. They're naturally integrating Wal-Mart and Jet.com right now. So we'll be working closely with them, but all the retailers have an interest in getting our products online on their dot coms. So we've been working with them to set up the pages.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, I know, Rick you shared that, you said about a third of that 6% price promotion drag on consumer domestic was related to trial and couponing if I heard you correctly. But that's still \u2013 I mean 400 basis points is still a big number, right. And it does sound like, I mean last quarter, you were very clear around the promotional environment, you gave a little tweak to the outlook for Q2 and in general to account for that. But it does feel like something picked up intra-quarter on that front. So can you just talk \u2013 just address that. I mean, was it reactionary? Was it pressure from you? We know that there is incredible price pressure among \u2013 competition between and among retailers. But it does feel like it's worse. If you can talk a little \u2013 address that and why that \u2013 anything I've said is incorrect?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. It's probably two things, one is just mix. As Matt said, some of the personal care items are down. So it just looks like the negative drag on price mix because some of our household businesses have higher trade rates. So I think that's part of it. I think and the other part, it's probably some of these trial activities are very enticing for the consumer. And so, when that happens, the volume goes up, but also price \u2013 the negative price mix goes up right along with it. So, that's kind of what happened I think in both cases.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, just switching to cat litter, I mean certainly fine performance of \u2013 good performance in the first half. I guess one is, is cat litter a growth category, I mean I don't currently own a cat, but I know plenty of people do, but I mean the whole category is growing 3.5% its outperforming most CPG categories out there. So, I mean is that something that's sustainable, is everybody kind of playing well in the \u2013 I'm not going to go there, playing well in the sandbox. Or do you think you should see more competitive pressure there as we look to the back half?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. In fact, if you go back, Bill and look at the last few years of 2014, 2015, and 2016, the clumping cat litter category actually grew faster than 3.4%. So, that has been a perennial grower for a number of years. So, we don't expect that to change. Pets are the new, they're like children. People are happy to invest in them and innovation and price has driven a lot of that growth over time.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","But you're not seeing Nestle or Clorox get, trying to win, I mean last year it was much more competitive. It seems like it's eased per se this year?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. No. In fact, the amount sold on deal was 21%, it was 22% in the first quarter. So, it's pretty level.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then on the vitamins side, this is the first time I've really \u2013 I think, really heard you say that there has been more discounting more BOGOs. I mean it's been more of the category has had its ups and downs, but now it sounds like everybody is jumping into the gummy side. Is that something that you just kind of step back and let it play out, or I mean is there anything you can do to really push your brands and kind of differentiate yourself? I mean how should I look at that especially as we move into not only the back half of the year, but into 2018?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. So we've been on the side lines with respect to the buy one, get ones. So what, our focus is on the brand equity. So it is a sea of brands, there are 30 gummy vitamin brands with all the gummy vitamin brands. So the game really long-term is they're not all sustainable. And so over time what will happen is the retailers will pull those back. So the long game is to win with the brand equities that connect with consumers. So you'll be seeing us being very focused on differentiating our brand versus the other brands. And of course I won't tell you how we're going to do that.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And just a quick \u2013 I thought you were rolling out a lot of new, a lot more SKUs there. Did that have the impact on growth that you were expecting or is it, the overall category slow down is offsetting that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, no, no. The gummy category is growing. So we're going sideways because we haven't been engaging in the BOGOs and competitors have been doing the BOGOs and we have not. I mean it's as simple as that.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","The new products are doing well. So we have Simply Good, this is one of our new products we've got an energy gummy vitamin, but that's not enough to offset the BOGOs. So we've lost some sales to other brands.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","But it's not something you want \u2013 you don't want to follow that one down the hole. You got to take the long view on it.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I understand. Thanks so much.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, first question just want to go back to your outlook for category growth for this year, I guess early in the year was plus 2%, and first half you mentioned it's been plus 1.5%. That 50 basis points delta, that's all price or is there any volume slow down that you're seeing in some of those categories in the U.S.?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, look, I'd say it's both, I wouldn't say it's all one or the other. I mentioned there were five categories that were in personal care that are down between 2% and 5% in the second quarter. And I don't have any stats for you for the full year, but that is one of the drags that we're dealing with there.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So, it's a little bit of both. In terms of the gross margin outlook, you're sticking with plus 40 bps this year, that's what you've done in the first half, but it looks like second quarter obviously well below that. How much confidence do you have that the improving mix and things like that will help you in the second half, and how much are you counting on and easing of the promotion environment to help drive that second half?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think we're very confident in the gross margin outlook, Joe, I mean part of it is like I said before the comps right for example in the first half our vitamin business was up 5% in 2016. And our second half was flat, right. And so we did a lot to win back the consumer in the first half of 2016, and that's what we're comping over this year. So, we expect to have some good tailwinds on the personal care side in the back half, and we also have some good productivity projects in the pipeline. So, we feel really good about our Q4 number and our full year number for gross margin.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And just one last one, the timing of the closure of Water Pik, any guess as to late in the quarter?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","It'll probably be sometime in this month.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for sliding me in. I suppose I want to take up on the gross margin line of questioning. Certainly, some of the algorithm for ongoing evergreen gross margin expansion for you guys has been predicated on healthy business mix shifts. What I'm hearing you describe today is a more challenging environment for the personal care sleeve of your portfolio, condoms lower, pregnancy test kits lower, vitamin category fragmented becoming more competitive, and obviously it's kind of played out in results with personal care lagging. Meanwhile, the household side really, really aggressive. How do we think about the enablers of margin on a go-forward and also while we're at it maybe you can give us a few of the puts and takes that contribute to margin this quarter?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, sure. I'll start with that one and then go into the, kind of the outlook again, but in my script I said we had a drag of about 180 basis points on promotional spending, with negative price mix, mainly negative price. We had a 30 basis point drag from commodities, plus 60 basis point on productivity and then we had around 80 basis points of help from acquisitions and divestitures to get to the minus 80 basis points for the quarter. And so we're essentially flat to slightly up for the first half.","I think as you look at the second half, there's a few things going on. Number one, some of that new product trial, the deep couponing kind of that peels off as you get the repeat purchases without all the promotional activity. So, that's a good thing for gross margin. I think our productivity pipeline continues to improve. Commodities, the drag gets a little less in the second half as we start to lap some of the negativity we had in the back half of 2016.","I think, the personal care question you raise is a fair one, but I think more than anything, it's more of a comp analysis. Again, a good example of that is just this, the VMS business was very promotional in the first half of 2016 as well because we were winning back the consumer because we were out of stock in 2015. And so we don't have that level of promotion. Is the category maybe a little bit more promotional, yes. But, year-over-year it still won't comp that. So, hopefully that helps.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason, if you want to take the long view. So, in a lot of these personal care categories we are the number one brand. So, you wouldn't be privy to what launches we have prepared for 2018 or 2019. But innovation is always going to be the winner here. And also with respect to margin, the other thing that expands it for us is our Good to Great program which is a continuous improvement and the other kicker is always acquisitions that we take on that have higher than corporate gross margin. So, that's why we felt good about calling next year for 3% organic top line growth and 9% EPS growth.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful guys. And one more then I'll pass it on. I want to build off of Lauren's line of questioning, but from a slightly different angle. She probed on e-com, you guys clearly have a lot of great momentum and are investing behind it. There has been a tremendous amount of consternation. It's been primarily anchored on the food side of staples these days about retailer retaliation, trying to sharpen price points, kind of suck some of the oxygen out of the air as discounters move in and as encroachment from Amazon builds. Lots of pressure for price concessions and clear evidence of using private label as a lever. Stepping into the HBC world, where these categories are further afield online and arguably have more potential going forward. It would seem like your categories are equally susceptible to sort of the retailer pressure. So my question is just that, are you seeing it? Are you seeing evidence of retailers trying to push to get those price points sharper to help fend off some of the channel shifts that may be beginning to build moment?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Is your question specifically about our bricks-and-mortar retailers squeezing CPGs more than in the past because of online pressure?","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. That's a nice distinct summary of it, yes.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Well look, the retailers, this is not a new phenomenon, this has been going on for several years now. So every year the retailers are aggressive with respect to our price concessions and this year is no different. I think whenever you're negotiating with a retailer you certainly want it to be a win-win and that's how we approach it. So if in fact, there are some things they want us to do, there's something they'll do for us in return with respect to shelving, or endcaps, et cetera, so. And we've been able to perform really well under these circumstances and we don't view that as we're going to be any more susceptible than any other company. In fact, we think we may be handling it better than others.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is it fair to assume that your guidance for the balance of the year, you're assuming the $0.02 drag from Water Pik in 3Q, but it would reverse again in the fourth quarter because you had said before that it would be flat or neutral for fiscal year 2017 \u2013 I am sorry for fiscal year, yeah so for this fiscal year 2017 just to make sure that I have the right number here?","And then related to that, so then if I take the $0.53 of the fourth quarter, you would still take that, those $0.02 accretion, then you'd imply as to meeting (41:54) rebounding year-on-year on EPS. So, I was wondering, if you can help us bridge that. So, as you're talking before and if I understood it correctly. The 4 percentage points drag in pricing, you said obviously and that's your couponing, that is still kind of a category drag. You're assuming the category drag goes away in the fourth quarter or in other words perhaps people are just going to use their stocks or destocking and then you're going to have a pickup in repurchases after they've tried your product, is that the way we should think about it?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, Andrea. So, there is a couple of questions in there. The first is on Water Pik, you're exactly right. It's flat for the full year. We have a $0.02 drag in Q3, largely because of the transactional and transitional expenses and not a full quarter worth of earnings. And then a plus $0.02 for the fourth quarter and flat for the year.","Your second question, so that implies with our Q3 outlook, that implies a 20% growth rate in earnings in Q4. You're exactly right, that's really two things, 20% is around $0.09 and that's really two things. One is that half of it is the shift of marketing that we've been talking about all year long, right we said we're going to move a lot of our Q4 spending into Q2 and Q3 to better line up with our new product launches. That's about half of it. The other half is, as we've mentioned before we have a better organic growth rate in the back half of the year, so and some gross margin improvement. So, those are the two things driving 20% growth.","And then the third question you had was a 400 basis point drag in couponing. Now remember a year ago \u2013 that's not just couponing by itself, it's also couponing trade spends and plotting and what not. So, it's a little lumpy in 2016 compared to 2017. I'd tell you that we have some promotional spending throughout the balance of the year, but it's not like we're pulling everything back and we hope we're going to continue to do great without spending. Like we said before, we're hitting our levels right at our competition.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Rick, just what I meant the 400 basis points is that out of the 600 basis points that you had as a drag in price mix, 200 bps was related couponing and then the balance would be industry trends or as you guys were mentioning five categories being very negative. So, I was just wondering if you're assuming that the industry embedded in your guidance that the industry stabilize in the fourth quarter, because I understand the couponing that you had in the fourth quarter or the second half of last year was very mild, it was like 35 bps drag. So, I was wondering if, 50 bps drag \u2013 I'm sorry. So I'm wondering if it's mostly related to the industry, that you believe it will stabilize or it's probably that right, so if you...","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Right. I understand. The biggest driver is actually mix right. We've said in the first half of the year, part of that 400 basis points drag is personal care, right. And so we expect personal care to be better in the second half right. My answer to Lauren was part of the reason we have a negative price mix, when you look at organic growth is because we have more household increase and then personal care declining. And so just as that naturally balances back out that will improve the negative drag on the price mix line too.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair. Thank you so much, Rick.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. First, I just want to follow up on an earlier question around pantry inventory. Given all the couponing and the promotion. Do you think that you're just pulling forward demand like has it \u2013 in your view, has there been pantry stocking on the part of consumers, because of all the promotional activity. And then as commodity prices continue to move, how do you think that \u2013 will that impact levels of competitive promotion going forward?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well pantry loading is always a matter of a conjecture, right. We cannot \u2013 if you look at the amount of promotion in the quarter, as we said before, it's 36%. The fact that we \u2013 it shifted from other retailer stocks. Remember, we were the only manufacturer that grew share in the quarter. So everybody lost share to us, I wouldn't say that there's pantry loading broadly as a result.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And the laundry category is only up around 1% or 1.5%. So it's not like the consumption was sky high.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just in terms of like the track versus untracked growth, it seems to be moving around quite a bit. I mean, last quarter you were well ahead of track. This quarter it went the opposite way. I mean is this just a function of lapping some of the recent gains you've had in the untracked channels and now you're sort of lapping that or has your thoughts on promotion in channels shifted in some way?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, Olivia, we still have growth in untracked channels, we're not lapping any big gains or anything like that. We still have growth, it's just the biggest driver is between the Nielsen data and even when you add in the untracked stuff is the negative drag from couponing. And there is a little bit of retailer inventory shifts but the primary driver is the gross to net couponing stuff.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, there has been a lot of questions on your promotional spending in the quarter. But I guess \u2013 I just wanted to circle back on something. I was hoping you guys could compare the magnitude of your incremental couponing and promotional investments in your tracked maybe versus non-tracked channels. I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how much you're driving growth in non-tracked or maybe online, via promos or is that just, that growth really just coming from the long-term structural shifts we've been seeing out of the brick and mortar channels?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. It's a simple answer, it's primarily bricks and mortar. So, it's just \u2013 don't think of it as \u2013 that it's online promotions.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then another question on BATISTE, it continues to have great momentum. So, I guess I'm wondering what you guys think the real opportunity is for this brand. And then what the opportunities are to leverage the brand further into other adjacent categories. And essentially how quickly could you guys execute on this, I mean. And then finally I guess I'm curious, if you think there is any risk that your momentum in dry shampoo could fade over time due to some of the momentum from the hair care, heritage brands, as the category grows in the U.S.?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Actually, the simple way to think about the opportunity for dry shampoo for us is \u2013 this originated in the UK and in the UK the value of the category is $60 million, and they have a little over 60 million people in the UK. In the U.S., with 335 million people, the category size is only $130 million right now. Now it's growing rapidly, I think it grew 30% in the second quarter. So, it's growing like a rocket but ship but it has a long it with ago. The category size could double over the next few years. And we would enjoy a tremendous amount of growth as a result of that, because we have the number one share and we're in the low-30%'s.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then what about the opportunity to further leverage the brand? What are your thoughts there?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. That's always an opportunity to go in adjacencies, because the BATISTE brand is so strong, particularly with young users, but we wouldn't telegraph what we might be thinking about doing there.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Is that it?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. I guess we're done. Thanks for joining us today. And we'll talk to you at end of the third quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","James R. Craigie","Good morning. I want to welcome all of you who took the time, thankfully, to come visit us today in the boardroom of the New York Stock Exchange. I want to thank those listening to our call. I am so excited today, I can't tell you. I have been waiting 6 months for this day. For 6 months, I've had to listen to chatter from our competitors about what they're going to do in 2014. And for 6 months, I've had to bite my tongue because I didn't want to tip off my competitors. I come from a world where you don't tip off your competitors even for 30 seconds. You don't give them any advance notice. Well, today's D-Day for Church & Dwight. Today, we're going to announce the onslaught of new products that we're going to launch this year. It's the greatest launch of new products in the history of our company. I know you heard -- some heard me say before, every year is great. Well, this is truly the greatest. We have never before launched a great new product across every one of our major categories. So today, we get the joy of telling you and telling the world about these great new products.","So let me start our presentation today. Safe Harbor Statement, a lot of words, basically says, if you go ahead and buy the stock based on what we say today, which includes forward-looking statements, proceed at your own risk. I think you're very smart to proceed.","Opening remarks. Let me give you a New York minute about what you're going to hear today and then capsulize it. Number one, you're going to hear we had very solid Q4 results. We're exiting the year with great momentum. Two, that capped off a great year, our 13th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. I think 2013 was awesome, gang, 9% revenue growth, 80 basis point increase in gross margin, 30 basis point increase in higher marketing spending, 30 basis point decline in our overhead cost, 80 basis point increase in operating margin, 14% increase in EPS, 6 of our 9 power brands grew share. Gang, that's 7 for 7. That's hitting it out the park. A great 2013. And again, Matt will give you the details, but we exit the year with great momentum.","The Avid acquisition is exceeding all of our expectations, another great acquisition by our company. So we've stepped back and said, \"Okay, great history, a lot of stuff going on in 2014 from our competition. We can crawl into a shell and just play prevent defense.\" We didn't believe that. We're playing to win. We're coming out to win with a very aggressive but achievable plan. I mean, our numbers, some companies would step back and say, \"Well, pullback, invest, invest.\" Well, we're investing, but we're also delivering 6% to 10% EPS growth, which based on the rest of the competitive industry is top-quartile results. So we're playing to win. We're investing. We're still delivering great results.","I've said it before, it's the largest new product pipeline ever in our company. And we're evolving it, too, on our marketing side. We've always had our 8 power brands, 9 with vitamins. We're evolving to 4 mega brands, slight evolution, not revolution, evolution of spending more money on our 4 biggest brands, which will deliver great results.","We're off to a good start. It's early. We have strong retailer acceptance of all of our great products, but we don't know final shelving. We don't know final pricing. We don't know final consumer takeaway. So there's a lot to be known. That's why we have a range right now. We're doing a massive onslaught, but there's a lot we don't know yet out there, which makes us come with a range out on the year.","And we're not foregoing acquisitions. We're aggressively pursuing additional acquisitions. A pretty hot pipeline out there. And that's all I can say on that today.","So with that, let me bring Matt up here to tell you how we finished 2013. Here's Matt.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Okay. Hey, Jim, thank you for that bouncy introduction. I'm going to cover Q4 and full year 2013. Just from the top, you probably remember from our third quarter call that we expected 1% to 2% organic growth for the fourth quarter. We came in at 2.3%. And for the last 2 quarters of the year, Q3 and Q4, we had approximately 5% volume growth. So very strong volume. But we also know in Q3 and Q4, there was a lot of price competition, so that continued in Q4. Gross margin was also a little better than expected, came in up 90 basis points, up year-over-year, resulting in 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. So EPS up 14% in the fourth quarter.","Some things I didn't talk about. So you look at the top, you'll see that the reported sales was up 1.6%. The marketing at 14.3% was the highest of the year. I'll show you that in a second. We got nice leverage on SG&A. So that was down 100 basis points. Some of that is because we had some Avid cost in last year's fourth quarter. And you see the effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%. We expected 34% for the year and 34% for the quarter. So it came in about right.","And here's the volume and price\/mix equation. So you see on -- 5.2% was the volume for the quarter. You see the breakdown by the divisions. And you see, it was a heavy quarter for price\/mix of negative 2.9%, landing down to 2.3%. You can see in the international line what happens when you take price, has an impact on your volume. They we're down -- they were up only 30 basis points for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And we're proud of that record. And it was the highest quarter of the year for marketing, 14.3%.","So now let's take a look at the full year, look back on this. So we had 1.9% top line growth. On a full year basis, the volume was 3.8%. Gross margin up 80 basis points. You may recall that we expected about 75 basis points on a full year basis. So a little bit higher than expected. And the operating margin up 80 basis points.","Turning to free cash flow. You know our definition of free cash flow is cash from operations minus CapEx. And the reason this says adjusted is because you may recall, we had a fourth quarter 2012 federal tax payment. It was deferred because of Hurricane Sandy. We paid it in the first quarter of 2013. But apples-to-apples, free cash flow is up 14%, same with EPS, up 14%. So that's a real high-quality year.","And then free cash flow conversion, of course, is very important. So it's the relationship of free cash flow to your net income. And we're up 119%. The other thing I want to point out, if I go back to the previous slide is -- oops, actually it's not the previous slide, it's the one after it. If you're following along at home, we're on Slide 13. I want to point out here is, if you look at the effective tax rate, you'll see, okay, 2012, we got a 35.5% rate. And this year, we did 34% rate. So you'd say, \"Wow, you got a lot of benefit year-over-year from the effective tax rate.\" Not true. It was actually all offset on JV and interest and other line. So our operating income was up 14% in 2013 year-over-year, same as our EPS. So that's why we call this a high-quality year.","Here's the organic growth by quarter. You can see we ended the year at 2.3%. So that's the highest quarter of the year. Obviously, a little bit helped by Avid because Avid became organic in the fourth quarter. And it was a share story. So of our 9 power brands, we had 6 that grew share year-over-year. While ARM & HAMMER, that's all variance, it was flat year-over-year share-wise and SPINBRUSH and Orajel were down.","The gummy acquisition. So net sales up 20% plus year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis. This is a business we acquired October 1, 2012. Well on our way with respect to the synergies. And you probably saw the announcement that we're expanding capacity by 75% in 2015. So that's a $55 million investment, and it's over a 2-year period.","So this is our 13th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. You can see on the far right, up 14%, came in at $2.79, which was our expectations for the full year.","And here's our cash conversion cycle story. So we're a very metric-driven company. So we think that working capital management is a function of discipline within a corporation. So you can see that in 2011, we had a heroic year. We hit 28 days for our cash conversion cycle. But if you do the math on this, you'll see that if you take receivables, inventory less payables, which we call operating working capital, it's about 10% of our net sales.","Here's the free cash flow story. I mentioned that before, $469 million. It's up 14% year-over-year. And we're not a capital-intensive company. So you can see we're 2.1% CapEx as a percentage of sales. You'll often hear us talk about, we bang around 2.5% in general. By the way, the expectation for 2014 is $85 million of CapEx, of which $40 million of that is the investment in the vitamin expansion.","And here's the balance sheet. So you can see, we're levered 1.2x debt to EBITDA. So we got a lot of firepower there. And I'll do the math for you. If you look at this slide, you can see that -- what our borrowing capacity is about $2.1 million (sic) [$2.1 billion]. Assuming we did an acquisition and we levered up to 3.25x EBITDA. So a lot of ability here to go shopping. And you also read that we announced a dividend increase yesterday of 11%. And we've been steadily increasing our dividends over a number of years. And we have a target payout of 40% of net income.","And here are the prioritized uses of free cash flow. This should be a very familiar slide to a lot of people. Well, I'm going to start out, as you probably saw in the release that we expect to generate $1.5 billion of free cash flow over the next 3 years. And we generated lots of cash. So remember, you saw on an earlier slide, we have $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. If you generate $470 million on an annual basis and your dividend, that we just declared, is $170 million, that's another $300 million. So you got cash on hand. We generate at least $300 million even after dividends and then have the significant borrowing capacity.","The other thing you saw on the release is that we announced a couple of share repurchase programs. One is called an Evergreen. The Evergreen program is simply there to enable us to eliminate share creep as options are exercised. And the other one is a $500 million share repurchase program. You probably have some questions about, well, how much of that is going to get spent in 2014 versus \u201815. The way you think about that, this is a multi-year program. Historically, this past year, we bought $50 million of shares in the first quarter. The most we've acquired in any 1 year is $250 million. But this does give us a lot of flexibility with respect to destinations for our cash.","And with that, I'm going to go to Jim.","James R. Craigie","Thanks, Matt. So great quarter, capped off a great year, but now let's look forward. First of all, I want to tell you, look at the total shareholder return of this company over the past 10 years, which is my tenure as Chairman and CEO. I mean, I just want to stop at this slide for the next hour. But just look at this, 394% return since July of 2004, blows away anybody else in this industry, about 6x the S&P 500. And we did it largely through -- the blue part there is the stock price appreciation and the gold part is dividends. You can see, we've been very driven by driving the stock price but paying a nice dividend on top of this. Some of our competitors are more like bonds, they pay a dividend, but terrific results. So you sit there and say, \"Great job, Jim and your team.\" My team is in the room here today.","But what about the future? And I'm going to give you 10 reasons today why I believe we can continue to deliver superior total shareholder return. First of all, you've heard me talk about this a lot, but it's evolving a little bit. We have a recession-resistant product portfolio. If you've seen this chart in the past, you'll notice, it's been slightly tweaked. We used to be 60% premium, 40% value. Now we're 55% premium, 45% value. And I'll show you why in a second. But it's great to have a value part of your portfolio during a rough time in the economy.","I showed this slide before about proving the value part of our portfolio. Our laundry detergents have been half the price of the premium brands, same for fabric softener sheets. Toothpaste at half the price of the leading brands, some forms in cleaners. What's new is vitamins. Many of you don't realize, our vitamin business is only about 45% -- about 45% lower than One a Day. So even on the vitamin side, where we got great brand products, they offer great value to consumers. Hey, it's a recession and we constantly show people, consumers have been switching constantly from the premium and mid-priced categories into the value and extreme value categories.","In laundry detergent. Now more households buy a value laundry detergent than premium or mid-tier products. You'll see here now the value price segment of the category has now increased the path to mid-tier category, with almost 30% of people buying value detergents. Church & Dwight, of course, is the king of that category. We've gained almost 7 share points in value. And we're now bigger than #2, 3 and 4 players combined, with over half the share of the value segment.","Dollar-wise, Church & Dwight is the only company that has grown share in the dollar -- in the laundry detergent category since 2009, significant share growth. Everybody else has lost share. We're second in terms of wash loads because we offer great value. Look at wash loads, what people actually use. In terms of wash loads, we're creeping in very closely to the king of the category and showing terrific growth in our brands. So more and more people are actually using Church & Dwight laundry products.","Now you've all heard the big news, which one of my competitors have been talking about for 6 months. Procter & Gamble's coming out with a lower-priced version of Tide. If you want to ask questions about that, call Cincinnati, okay? I don't run that brand. But I ask you 2 questions to think about, I have no answers to, but 2 things we're going to watch the next few months. Will this further accelerate the growth of the value segment? Which has already been growing phenomenally as I've shown you. And two, where\u2019s the volume going to come from? Are they going to come out of their brand, premium Tide or non-Tide users. We don't know. It'll be the big question going forward here, but a major initiative on their part.","We don't sit back and say, \"Hey, just pullover the covers over our head and defend our business.\" We believe a great defense or best defense is a great offense. And what we're doing is we're responding in a big way. We're launching 3 major new products in the laundry category in 2014. We're launching a new version of ARM & HAMMER. We're launching the OxiClean brand into the laundry detergent category. And we're launching the OxiClean brand also into the bleach category. 3 major initiatives. Now you want to know the details? You got to wait 10 minutes because I'm going to bring up my 2 geniuses who drive all that, my Head of New Products, Steve Cugine; and my Head of Marketing, Bruce Fleming. They're going to come up here and tell you about the details about that in about 10 minutes when I stop talking. So stay tuned and keep your seatbelts on.","The second big thing which drives future total shareholder return is, we believe in building mega brand, new word for us, mega brand.","You saw about power brands. We're now talking about mega brands. In the past, we've had 8 power brands. You see the great brands we have. Those were 80% of our revenues and profits. There's the great 8 brands, all #1 or 2 in their categories. I'll show you on Chart 2, they're not just important to us, they're important to retailers. You see the top 10 SKUs in the category, our brands are all part of the top 10, some -- all 10 of 10 in the case of condoms. So our brands are very important to retailers.","What's our share growth formula for those? Very consistent formula. We have innovative new products, put increased marketing spending behind that. That gives you increased distribution. Add them all together, you get share growth on your power brands. You can see we've had terrific track record of innovation on these things. Steve Cugine and his genius gang have done a great job. Today, 32% of our business in 2013 was from new products we launched starting back in 2007. So we've flipped 1\/3 of our portfolio in that timeframe all driven by innovation.","You look forward to how we do on the advertising spending. Here's some new data. This may shock you. Church & Dwight as a company is the 13th largest advertiser in the United States, more than many of the other companies who are much bigger than us in revenue. Look at that chart. Look at the competitors we little Church & Dwight spend more on advertising dollar in the United States than those big names. That tells you how big we are in advertising and how much we've increased our advertising over the year. Later on, Bruce Fleming is going to talk to you about some of our individual brands. And they shock you how much we spend at some of our brands than some of the big players. And our products are taking that because of those great new innovations because of our increased marketing spending. Here's a chart that shows you, if you look at our distribution base back in 2009, how much distribution we've gained on an index basis versus that for all of our brands, very impressive out there. Of course, you add that altogether, you get share growth. And over the last 5 or 6 years, because 75% of the time, we've grown share in categories. I challenge any other manufacturer to show that chart. I doubt they've grown share 75% of the time.","Now is an evolution time. We focus on 8 power brands in the past. You have 9 for the new vitamin business. We're putting more of our focus going forward on the 4 big mega brands: ARM & HAMMER, TROJAN, OxiClean and our vitamin business. Why? Because those 4 mega brands represent 60% of our sales and profits. Those 4 mega brands have been a tremendous growth from the past. What's a mega brand, you say? Well, mega brand is a -- a great example is ARM & HAMMER. Here's a brand that covers all sorts of categories. It's found in more aisles in the grocery store than any other brand in America. It's in both premium and value segments. And we've supported a very powerful holistic advertising campaign, very important. It's the right brand at the right time at the right value, terrific business for us.","Now how do you drive a mega brand? It's the same formula as the power brand: innovative new products increased marketing spending, increased distribution, that all leads to share growth. But here's the difference. Here's why mega brands are different than power brands for 4 reasons: One, you get a bigger bang for your buck in your R&D investments. You don't have to spend as much supporting other forms. You also get a bigger bang for your buck on marketing investment. There's also greater licensing potential and lower organizational cost. 4 big advantages for a mega brand over a power brand. Let me show you what that means, hey, with ARM & HAMMER. ARM & HAMMER has baking soda. Baking soda has a lot of properties, but you can take those properties and spread them across all sorts of forms across all sorts of category versus being just a one category business.","Marketing-wise, $1 spent smartly at any form of mega brand helps all forms of the mega brand. And Bruce Fleming and his team has done a great job the way they do our advertising. That $1 spent, whether it's in a laundry detergent, cat litter, anything helps the whole business. If you're just a one category business, $1 spent just helps you in that one category. Here, $1 spent gets a much bigger bang for the buck. Our 4 mega brands, we're actually going to spend 74% of our advertising next year on those 4 brands. Remember, that's 60% of our revenue and profits, we're going to spend 74% of our advertising dollars because we'll get a bigger bang for the buck on those.","Licensing-wise, hey, mega brands, other players want it. There's categories we don't want to launch in directly. We do over 3 -- what does it say? Over $185 million in retail sales, over 400 licenses on the ARM & HAMMER brand alone. That generates licensing fees for us which are very powerful, 100% gross margin. Think about that. And organizationally, hey, when you have a mega brand, you're going to have one team driving a mega brand versus separate teams driving individual brands. So organizational costs are lower on a mega brand. So you got those 4 advantages, all of them helps you drive bigger profits to the bottom line by putting more support behind your mega brands. So Bruce and Steve are going to talk about that shortly.","Our 2014 plan reflects that focus. We're going to increase the ad spending, as I told you a moment ago. We'll do more major product launches on every mega brand. And we're going to be entering white space, side categories in these brands and making a bigger mega brand going out there. 5 minutes, wait till you see those details. Steve and Bruce will show you that. So hang on to your seats.","Let me talk number 3 reason of the 10 why we're going to keep growing our total shareholder return. We are very good at ferociously defending our brands. A good example there is OxiClean. We bought that business in 2006. It was a 27% share of the laundry additive category. We grew that to over a 40% share in a couple of years. How did we do that? We have great new products, great new claims for that business as we entered new parts of the category. We increased the marketing support tremendously. But then we had a big attack, recognize that guy? Sound familiar? They like to attack us. Back in mid-2009, they came into the category with their big brand name attacking our product. What did we do? Did we just crawl into a hole and say, \"Oh, well, give up share, give up profits?\" Hell, no. We launched that with all great new forms of OxiClean. We co-branded it with other businesses to give greater marketing power for the business. We increased the ad spending. It's the second most advertised brand in the fabric care category. And what happened? 4 years later through 2013, we not only held our share, we grew our share. And we're bigger now than the 3 other players in this category. And then the little guy, look at the names on that chart as to who we grew share against with OxiClean, pretty big players in the overall world. We beat them back all. We grew the most share. And tell you again, we're bigger than all 3 of them together. So when you think about us being attacked, as we are being right now by a competitor in another part of the laundry category, think about how we've done in the past.","Fourth biggest reason is, hey, we're not a big international company. It's about 17% of our business these days, but we're a good player there. We're invested largely 6 countries of the bulk of our business. We've had great results across those franchises with mid- to high-single-digit growth in most of them. Great track record. How did we do that? Some of those markets have, we call, little power brands in those markets, we don't talk about. RUB A535 is a great product up in Canada. Grab All [ph] is a great product there. We've also expanded our corporate power brands or now mega brands into some of those countries. We've also done great with acquisitions. There's a product in the table back there today called Batiste, which is a good dry shampoo. We bought that, largely a U.K. product. We bought it. It's been growing fabulously in the U.K. We're now expanding it to other countries. Terrific growth. And leveraging our One Company strength. We only have one R&D team worldwide. We do the marketing worldwide. Everything to kind of keep our organizational cost down. They take the great news in every country and spread it to the rest.","Number 5, expanding gross margin. We love gross margin. Very important to us, have a huge focus on that. We've grown gross margin tremendously over the last 10 years, 1,600 basis points, more than any other company in the category. Look at that chart. Look at the other major players. We've grown almost 600 basis points since 2007 and nobody is even 1\/3 of that out there. 4 big parts of that. We have a Good to Great program. That's the name we take from the great book by Jim Collins in that, but it's our cost optimization program. That's the reformulation, resizing, reducing SKUs on that. Second thing is supply-chain restructuring. We build brand new plants. It's much more efficient for us. Acquisition synergies. When we acquire a business, we drive the costs out of it to help their gross margins. And price\/mix, we're always about launching new products with a higher price, a higher margin than the product it replaces.","Number 6, acquisitions. We've had a great track record on acquisitions. Why? Because we're very careful of what we buy. We only buy a #1 or 2 share brand. We want higher growth, higher margin brands. We want asset-light businesses, meaning, we don't like to pick up businesses with lots of headquarters and lots of plants. We like to leverage our capital base. We have to leverage our strength in manufacturing, logistics and purchasing. And we want a business, we believe, that can deliver competitive long term sustainable advantages.","Here's our track record. Look at that, tremendous number all over. We don't just walk the walk, we talk the talk out there. That's why investment bankers come to us constantly. We just don't talk about acquisitions, we do them.","Of the 9 power brands I've talked about before, 8 of those we've acquired through acquisition. The only one that was the inherent brand was ARM & HAMMER back 160 years ago. But 8 of our 9 power brands we call today came through acquisitions. And we just don't buy them and milk them. We buy them and we grow them. We drive the share price up with better marketing power, better sales force power, and we cut the cost out of them to drive greater profits for the company. So a great track record on acquisitions. And we're actively looking for new acquisitions. We've got $2.6 billion of dry powder as Matt showed you. We're actively out there looking for it. And we hope to continue to turn those acquisitions into gold for our company.","Number 7, Matt alluded to this earlier, we are best in class, not just good at free cash flow, best in class. We've increased the free cash flow over 500% since 2002. And if you look at the statistics, this free cash flow as a percent of net income, nobody is better than us. And we just had another great year of performance.","Number 8, overhead management. We don't let any line of the P&L go by. Overhead management, we're great at. We've increased revenues 113% since 2004 and only increased headcount 11%. Think about that. Doubling the revenues of the company and barely have any overhead growth at all. It has resulted in the highest revenue per employee of any major CPG company. Little Church & Dwight, $3 billion, shouldn't be able to do that against guys in that chart as big as $80 billion. But we do it, highest revenue per employee. And effectively, we walk the walk on tight overhead controls. I don't have a company car. Nobody has a company car. Nobody has golf club memberships, no corporate planes. We don't believe in that. That's not good for our shareholders. It's not good for us because we're major shareholders, too. And you say, \"Well, how can you get better?\" We will. We're doing things with the new health care plans, new information systems, leveraging headcount to go forward. You will see our overhead go down going forward.","Number 9, one of my little favorite secrets I've talked about, expert management team. We believe in expertise. My top team of 40 people, they are lifers in their job. My 8 business unit managers, I tell them, you're in that job for life. And so some say well who would want to do that? Well you want to do that when you become experts and drive the great results we do? And those people will have over 20 years of experience.","How does that pay off? Well, first, when you saw the share chart earlier. 75% of the time, we beat share because we know our businesses cold, where competitors change people around. They don't know their businesses. We don't make mistakes. Secondly, that enables to minimize headcount growth. Hey, you don't need extra bodies to help you run a business when you know it cold.","Execution, third thing. Hey, when you know and you're working with the same people for 20 years, you'd believe me, the execution's great versus not knowing who's running what function doing what. And the last thing is, we bring acquisitions in. Well, my people, they know the business so well, they don't need a full day to run their business. They love new acquisitions. That's what's new to them. They love new things. So we give them new acquisitions, keep the headcount down.","Last one, if you add those 9 factors up, you get a bunch of total shareholder return junkies. We love our business. Look at those statistics of how we've grown revenue, gross margin, increased the advertising, cut the overhead, driven the cash flow, driven the EPS. It all pays off. You bought my stock 10 years ago, you'd have an average return of 16.3%. That blows away anybody else in this industry. That blows away the S&P 500. We got a great team of junkies. They're all here today. You're going to see us ring the closing bell today. We love it. We're a great team. We're total shareholder return driven. And believe me, we're 100% in the game. We're right with you as far as people recommending stocks or buying stocks. Our bonuses are tied 100% to business results. 25% of my bonus is based on hitting the net revenue growth goal, 25% is hitting the gross margin goal, 25% EPS, 25% free cash flow. I got to believe those 4 factors are the most important 4 factors in any model you do about companies growing stock.","Secondly, we only have stock options. We're not one of these games we got restricted stock or we got some sort of phantom stock. We are based -- our equity competition is 100% stock option. If the stock price doesn't go up, we don't win. Believe me, I was very pissed about yesterday. I can't believe what happened yesterday. I mean, we watch that stock price probably every 2 hours every day. We care about the stock price as much as you do. And we're required to be heavily invested in the company's stock.","So that's it. Jim is going to take a seat and have another cup of coffee. And now it's time to bring up my 2 geniuses. They're going to tell you about next year, Steve Cugine. Steve is my Head of New Products and also just took on the additional responsibility, typical at Church & Dwight, of running international business as our Head of International retired after a great career. And Bruce Fleming is my Head of Marketing, my Chief Marketing Officer. These guys work hand-in-hand. They're attached at the hip. Steve develops the great new products with his team and then works with Bruce's team to launch the great new products and the great results we have. So Jim, take a seat. Steve and Bruce, come on down.","Steven P. Cugine","Thank you, Jim. So Bruce and I are very excited to be here today. And we're going to talk about our 2014 new product innovation portfolio. There are 4 key takeaways from this presentation: One, Church & Dwight is built on corporate competency for new product innovation; two, new product innovation has been and will continue to be a critical driver of organic growth; three, innovation supports our mega brand growth drivers; and four, 2014 represents the most significant portfolio of new products in the company's history.","So our primary driver of growth is new product innovation. Church & Dwight defines innovation success as new products that drive sustainable organic growth at accretive gross margins with a focus on our mega brands. What you see is our track record for successful new product innovation. The dedicated new products team was started in 2006. In 2013, new products launched by this team will account for $1.1 billion in gross sales and represents over 32% of CHD's consumer domestic sales. Our new products are very sticky and thrives in-market over time.","We've created a fundamental capability for innovation at Church & Dwight. We started by separating new product development from brand management and future business from current. We added structure and governance by adding a staged gate management process and executive portfolio reviews just to name a few. We linked our business strategy and innovation strategies with technology strategies, further aligning new product marketing and R&D. We expanded our skills and innovation process knowledge. We had significant front-end training. The result, we have strong capabilities in both commercializing powerful line extensions and in qualifying significant future opportunities for growth by expanding our mega brands into adjacent categories.","We believe that great innovation requires 7 critical success factors: One, focus. As Jim mentioned already, we focus on our 9 power brands, with our sharpest focus on our 4 mega brands.","Number two, strategic alignment. We link business strategy to innovation strategy and to technical strategy. So we understand where to play and how to win.","Number three, compelling consumer insights. Everything starts with the consumer. We started to understand their pain points, needs and desires.","Number four, disciplined financial modeling. Unlike many consumer products companies, we manage innovation like it has its own P&L. We are responsible for incremental net sales growth and for accretive gross margins. This helps us to keep it real, improve forecasting accuracy and get rewarded for end market financial performance.","Corporate teamwork, number five. Creating new products requires the expertise of every single function in the company, so we lead product teams for each project we deliver.","Number six, development of winning products. R&D and consumer research tools are both used extensively at Church & Dwight to validate and optimize our launches. We have a great R&D team that develops products that exceed our concept expectations and wows consumers.","Seven, superb execution in market. Sales and marketing come together to deliver incremental SKUs on shelf and great advertising to drive trial. We know that when we drive trial on these great products, consumers, in fact, love them.","Following these 7 critical success factors, we've enjoyed great success in innovation at Church & Dwight. Before moving on to our 2014 innovation, however, I'm going to turn the presentation over to my partner in crime here, Bruce Fleming, our Chief Marketing Officer.","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay. Thanks, Steve. I see that Jim has been drinking water and coffee is not a good idea, Jim. I think we'll stick to water. I have the pleasure to talk about our brands, particularly ARM & HAMMER. It all began 150 years ago. And those of us who have been here over the last 8, 9 years have just had great pleasure in taking what we thought was a wonderful ship that just needed a little bit of polishing. But 150 years of focus and a renewed 8 to 9 years of focus have resulted in a very powerful brand. Today, ARM & HAMMER is over $1 billion in sales. And we think there's a lot of runway ahead. If you look since 2008, we've grown 44% or about 7.6% compound annual growth rate. You don't find many 150-year-old brands with that type of growth. In fact, you don't find many 150-year-old brands. But I think that speaks to the longevity and the staying power of this great equity.","When we first started looking at the brand about 8 to 9 years ago as marketers rather than mere consumers, it is clear to us we had a fairly fragmented presentation to the consumer, and we needed to harmonize it. You've probably seen some of these slides before, but it's fairly obvious. And what we did is we returned to the heritage color of the 1860s. So we really look to the past to develop our future. And it was a good move. It's really grown the business and making it easy for consumers to see our products in every aisle of the store.","We did the same thing with advertising. One of the first things, I know, Steve and I did is we talked to the retirees and sort of said, \"How did you build this great company?\" Of course, it was really quite a legacy that we have inherited. And everyone's answer kept going back to 1972, 1972. What did you do in 1972? Well, we advertised that people should put baking soda in the refrigerator. Steve and I looked at each other and we just sort of said, \"Well, that's a novel idea.\" I don't think any amount of modern consumer research would have said that, that was a good idea, but it was. It grew the business and then about 4 to 5 months, I think about 80% of American homes had a box of baking soda in the refrigerator. And I went back and said, \"Well, how did you get that idea?\" And they said, \"We found a pamphlet from the early 1900s that said, put a saucer with water and a teaspoon of baking soda on top of the ice in your ice chest and it will extend the life of the ice in your icebox.\" I think it was 1907. So we really didn't come up with the idea. We just went back to the past in order to grow the future. And that's exactly what we're doing today. And we continue to do, is that we have built a business based on the insights of the past and the strongest insights of those that are written in history.","I think that if you looked at our advertising over the last 6, 8 years, it's been pretty workman-like. It's pretty much -- it's hard-working blue-collar, like many of us, like many of our consumers. And what was particularly interesting is that we went back to the original baking soda in the refrigerator, but yet, we created enough freedom of expression to advertise all the individual variants of the ARM & HAMMER brand. And you've seen that over the years. And you're going to continue to see that in the future. And over that time, we tripled our media investment.","Jim alluded -- well, it's not only advertising. As you can see, we have a holistic campaign across all the important touch points that a true mega brand must touch, TV advertising, of course, print, radio. Public relations plays a big role. Mouth-to-mouth, person-to-person type of accolades about our product are really very important. Digital and social have been extremely important over the last few years. It's a problem solution type of business. And people who have an issue and they need a solution, they're online. And that's where ARM & HAMMER has been. You see a lot of YouTube videos. In fact, I think we've probably set a record for the most number of views for the smallest number of videos, as we benchmark ourselves versus competitors. Our merchandising has been really off the charts in terms of its impact with the renovation of our packaging line back to the old 1860s color.","From an advertising perspective, Jim alluded to this, but on a brand basis, it probably is little known that we're the 24th largest advertiser in the United States. We looked at the mega brands that all exist in the United States, added up all the reported media that they spend across all their variants. And there's a rating 1 to 100 in terms of the ranking. So you can see where, we have a lot of good company, a lot of venerable brands that we respect that are both above and below us, but little ARM & HAMMER, little Church & Dwight who competes against people much bigger than us are able to create scale to our voice by focusing our efforts. And that's what Jim has talked about. That's what he's preached. And that's what we've done.","Steven P. Cugine","Thanks, Bruce.","Bruce F. Fleming","And to talk a little bit about the new product innovations.","Steven P. Cugine","So we're going to take you through 2 examples in bringing this to life. One is, the first example is ARM & HAMMER plus OxiClean. The consumer need we identified is for superior stain removal for the value consumer. Our answer, we joined 2 powerful equities in 1 product, ARM & HAMMER and OxiClean. The result, ARM & HAMMER plus OxiClean represents a 3% dollar share of the liquid laundry detergent. It's bigger than Cheer, Era or Wisk. So successful, it spawned an entire plus Oxi segment in detergents.","The second example comes from the litter category. Consumers had a problem that we identified which was, the cat owners needed to control both urine and feces odors. Consumers and manufacturers were primarily focused on urine odor. Our answer, ARM & HAMMER Double Duty. At the time of launch, it was the only product to eliminate both feces and urine odors. The result? ARM & HAMMER Double Duty alone has achieved a 7.6% share of the clumping cat litter and is the #4 variant in the entire category. ARM & HAMMER has led innovation in this category, generating a 14% compounded annual growth rate since 1998.","Now we're going to show you how we intend to carry our innovation momentum into 2014, starting with exciting news on ARM & HAMMER.","We're going to begin with the cat litter category. Odor control is the #1 concern of consumers, which is why our answer to this problem is ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal Cat Litter, with a guaranteed 7-day odor-free home. This is an outstanding new product. It achieves 100% odor satisfaction, delivers superior clumping, no dust and low tracking and commands a premium price point in the $2 billion litter category. Bruce?","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay, Steve. So it's easier to develop very persuasive advertising when you've got a great product like the one that Steve and his team -- our teams put together with the help of R&D and everybody else. The problems are big problems. We provide a real solution. And if you have a cat and you haven't tried this product, I think we have some coupons. I can give them to you as you leave, but it's a great product. And Steve's focus groups, we had to pay for the focus groups, the people were just so compelling that we decided that the best way to advertise this product would be to show real consumer reaction to this wonderful product.","So we've tested this advertising like we test all our advertising. I think I've told Jim we have had more advertising tests in the field in the last 6 months than I've seen anywhere in my career for the number of brands that I've had responsibility for. And the advertising you're about to see is going to be -- I'll let you judge for yourself. And I'll tell you the results. If we could roll the tape, please?","[Presentation]","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay. So if you don't have a buy in our stock, if you look under the table, there's a litter box right next to you, but no doubt, you didn't smell it. The testing of this was really great. It's gratifying. It's the top 20% of commercials in the industry database that most of our competitors use and we use -- it's wonderful that all the hard work is able to be presented to the consumer in a persuasive way. So we're expecting big things this year on cat litter. Now Steve's going to talk about laundry detergent.","Steven P. Cugine","So we're going to focus on a category that has been the engine of growth for Church & Dwight for some time. In laundry detergents, nothing delights consumers like the fresh smell of just washed clothes. In fact, freshness is just about as important as value in the consumer purchase decision. Delivering freshness is what makes our new line of detergents stand out. Our answer to delivering freshness is ARM & HAMMER Clean Scentsations. This great new line is designed to deliver noticeably cleaner, whiter and vibrantly fresher laundry inspired by America's national parks. This line expands our portfolio into the highly fragrant segment, but does it in an ARM & HAMMER way. Bruce, over to you for the advertising.","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay. So our challenge is pretty clear. We needed to dial up the freshness, especially because that is a consumer driver for some of the -- our competitive brands, less so for ARM & HAMMER, but we certainly developed a product that delivers. So the advertising, you're going to see, does communicate that message. And as Steve said in an ARM & HAMMER way, we're actually donating royalties to America's national parks as a percentage of sales. And there's nothing -- there's no better way to celebrate an iconic American brand than to support our national parks. And the scents actually, as Steve said, were inspired by them. And I'll let you judge for yourself. And like all the products this year, it's guaranteed or your money back. So we are really stressing performance and also putting our money where our mouth is. So if you could roll the tape on this one.","[Presentation]","Bruce F. Fleming","Now this advertising also ranked in the top 20% of the database for the industry for all laundry detergents. So we've got some powerful advertising to support all the good work Lou Tursi and his team have done in getting us distribution. So I'll hand it over to Steve to talk about oral care at this point.","Steven P. Cugine","Great. Thanks, Bruce. Oral care is powered by innovation. So we conducted extensive research to identify what consumers are really looking for in their oral care regime. We found that whitening, enamel strengthening and overall health are really important, yet consumers want to go beyond just whitening. They want to look truly radiant, especially -- specialty whitening toothpaste do a great job of whitening, but you need more than whitening for a radiant smile. Our answer, ARM & HAMMER Truly Radiant, a premium toothpaste that has patented liquid calcium technology and delivers superb whitening, excellent cleaning, while it repairs and strengthens enamel and delights consumers with its outstanding taste. We paired this innovation with ARM & HAMMER Truly Radiant SPINBRUSH toothbrushes. These brushes are designed with axis bristles to reach deeper in between teeth and remove 100% more plaque than a manual toothbrush. Bruce?","Bruce F. Fleming","Yes, I'm really pleased to announce that we're teaming up with Alison Sweeney, the host of the TV show Biggest Loser, to promote and market this product. Strength and beauty is a key component of the product, and this embodies Alison. As we speak, the advertising is being filmed. I look forward to you seeing it on TV and online. I sound like a broken record, but this, too, was in the top 20% of toothpaste advertising in the industry database that we and all our competitors use. It is the highest scoring advertising that we've ever tested on toothpaste. So we're looking forward to making an impression with this product.","Okay. Now I have the pleasure to talk about our second mega brand, which truly has become our second mega brand, which is OxiClean. Since we bought it in 2006, it's just proven to me that it's one of the most powerful and resilient brands that I've ever worked on and, I think, of any brand in America. We lived through some incredibly fierce competitive situations, competitive launches that happened coincidentally with the death of our friend and pitchman Billy Mays. He's a very good friend of mine. And it was a hard time back then when really from a personal perspective when Billy passed, but we were in the middle of a competitive situation, and I think that we've emerged with a lot of strength. And it's as much to the great teamwork at Church & Dwight as it is to the strength of this brand.","If you look, since 2006, when we bought the business, it's grown 51%, compounded annual growth rate of 6.1%, but there's certainly a lot of opportunity to move beyond stain fighters and wash additives.","Like with ARM & HAMMER, it was a brand that just needed a bit of polishing. The packaging was a little bit fragmented, not as much as ARM & HAMMER. It was only a 10-year-old brand, but a marketing person can't help tinker with the packaging. And of course, we did. And as you can see, the iconic OXICLEAN blue helps consumers find our product throughout the supermarket, throughout the retailers. And you see the effervescent cleaning bubbles which are a signature part of our logo.","When we went to look at our advertising, we were blessed. We had, as I mentioned, a friend -- I still get a little choked up when I talk about Billy, grew to love him. OxiClean took care of big problems with a big solution. He believed in the business passionately. He was taken from us far too early, but I think this event actually made us stronger. We didn't know exactly how to replace Billy. How do you replace a member of your family? And we went off air for, I think, about 4 to 6 weeks, thought about it, studied every salesperson, pitchperson who had ever endorsed a brand from Orville Redenbacher, to Dave Thomas, to Colonel Sanders. And we decided that we needed to continue in Billy's tradition and find somebody bigger-than-life to take care of this bigger-than-life brand. And Who Better than Billy's real-life best friend, Anthony Sullivan. Sully has become a very close friend of all of ours. He was a little reluctant at first to step into Billy's shoes. He said nobody can fill Billy's shoes. But he's done so, and he's done so admirably. I remember the discussion we had with him, and we said, \"Sully, I think what we want to do is honor the man and advance the brand.\" And that's been our mantra. And if you get Sully at a quiet moment, he'll tell you that, that's been his impetus.","So anyway, we've had big demos, bigger-than-life spokespeople cut from the same cloth. Billy pitching on the boardwalk in New Jersey. Sully pitching in the streets of London. And we've developed some compelling advertising that's thematically similar over the years. And again, with the products that we have this year, we're going to guarantee them or your money back.","What's little known is that when you look at just fabric care advertising, again, we looked at reported spending across all fabric care brands, slowly but surely, OxiClean has become the #2 advertised brand in the fabric care category. These numbers are indexed to the spending of the market leader over the last year. And you can see that OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER are able to compete despite our relative size versus our major corporate competitors. But we are big in the consumers' minds, and we're big in the advertising arena.","But it's not just advertising. You've seen this before in our other brands. We've graduated from selling at county fairs in the boardwalk, but you'd find a lot of our efforts online especially because there are severe problems and solutions that people want to save. They want to save that christening dress. They want to save that favorite garment. And today, no matter your age, you're going online looking for how to solve that issue. And we've done a lot of wonderful things digitally in that business, as well as the traditional public relations and merchandising activity.","So I'm happy to say that we finished the year with great momentum. Its all-time high share in the fourth quarter. It's a great platform to grow. And so since our purchase in 2006 of this wonderful company, the brand has had some competitive situations, but the trend line has been always up. And it's, as I say, a very resilient and powerful brand.","I'm going to turn it over to Steve to talk about our current innovation.","Steven P. Cugine","Couldn't be more excited to talk about OxiClean's growth. We're going to take OxiClean into 3 major categories: the $7 billion laundry detergent category; the $1 billion auto dishwashing category; and the $800 million bleach category.","So first, we'll turn our attention back to the dynamic laundry category. The #1 consumer frustration in laundry detergent performance is getting the tough stains out. Consumers want to be able to remove all types of stains the first time. So our answer is OxiClean Laundry Detergent. This great new product is specially formulated to lift out even tough dried-on stains the very first time, from blazing whites and brilliant brights at a meaningful value to the leading brand. Bruce will show you the advertising.","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay. I'd like to talk about the advertising. And I think we have a demonstration that we wanted to show as well.","[Presentation]","Bruce F. Fleming","Thank you very much.","Steven P. Cugine","Thank you.","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay. So as I begin to tell you a little bit about the advertising, I can't help but...","Anthony Sullivan","I am getting started here with introducing America's favorite stain fighter.","Bruce F. Fleming","Sully, I'm in the middle of the presentation.","Anthony Sullivan","OxiClean, powered by the air you breath and activated by the water you and I drink. Boy, am I excited to be out of the laundry room and in the boardroom. It's mother nature approved. Look at that. It makes your whites whiter and your brights brighter. And if you think that's good, I've got some big news for you that are here today, OxiClean is introducing OxiClean Laundry Detergent, 4x more powerful, it gets your whites whiter, your brights brighter, takes out grass stains, clay stains, ketchup stains, mustard stains. It will take the Chief Marketing Officer's stains out. It will even take Steve's stains out. Coming to you this year only from OxiClean. That's about all I got for you right now, Bruce.","Bruce F. Fleming","Sully, you're in for a triple. Could we show the real advertising right now, please?","[Presentation]","Bruce F. Fleming","We're very excited about this launch. And as you can see, Sully is as well. We're going to now talk about dishwashing.","Steven P. Cugine","All right. Thanks, Bruce. The second new category we're going to talk about is auto dish. When phosphates were removed from auto dish detergents, it created a situation where consumers became dissatisfied. Category performance declined and consumers could no longer get the cleaning performance they wanted. OxiClean, with a strong heritage of getting tough stains out, is coming to consumers' rescue to tackle the toughest dishwashing jobs. Today, nearly 7 in 10 consumers still experience significant problems with existing auto dish solutions. Dried-on foods that don't come off, filming on glasses and baked-on stains are the top issues. This is why we created our new OxiClean detergent, with cleaning so powerful it eliminates the toughest stains, stuck-on foods, cloudy films and odors for crystal clear and clean dishes every time. Over to Bruce.","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay. I'm hoping I can get through this presentation, but I'm not entirely sure that I'll be able to with Sully upsetting it.","Anthony Sullivan","But wait, there's more. If your dishes are covered and are kind of clean, barely clean or are sort of clean, guess what you need. OxiClean Extreme Power Crystals. This is the glass done with the old stuff. This is the glass done with new OxiClean Extreme Power Crystals. You can get it in liquid or pack. It's coming to a grocery store near you. So don't do your dishes without using brand-new Extreme Power Crystals from OxiClean. We're not just taking over the laundry room. We're taking over the dishwasher as well. I'm pretty excited about this whole thing.","Bruce F. Fleming","Yes. All right. I wasn't sure this was a good idea. Okay, let's run the advertising.","[Presentation]","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay, I think 74% of consumers who saw that ad said they'd definitely or probably would buy it, so it's very high rating. Again, very high persuasion scores, in the top 20% of the dishwashing database. Very excited about it. Talk about bleach now.","Steven P. Cugine","Yes, and it's an outstanding product. So moving to bleach alternatives. Chlorine bleach can make consumers worry. Many consumers want an alternative to bleach, with less risk of ruining their clothes and without the harsh smell. This is why we're introducing OxiClean White Revive. It powers out tough laundry stains and delivers bleach-like whitening to revive whites without the chlorine smell, yellowing or color damage. So your clothes look newer, longer. Bruce?","Anthony Sullivan","But wait, there's more! It's no secret that bleach can ruin your clothes. It will damage your socks, it will leave your socks yellow and dingy. We actually had to use coffee today from the boardroom to make sure it worked. If you've got ink stains on your shirts or [indiscernible], turn to the power of where is it, new OXICLEAN White Revive. It cleans like bleach without the damaging effects of chlorine. In fact, I'm so convinced that it's so good that I guarantee, Mr. Bruce Fleming, Steve Cugine, and even our CEO, Mr. Craigie, please show me how white your socks are, please, gentlemen? Powered by the air you breathe, and activated by the water you and I drink. This is probably the only time I'm ever going to do this, so I'm going to soak it in, OxiClean, the stain specialist. It gets the tough stains out, and it's not clean unless it's OxiClean. All right! Let's hear it one more time, it's not clean unless it's OxiClean.","Steven P. Cugine","Okay, all right, okay. He's just an obstreperous guy, I can't really say much about him. Human resources and legal, Jackie Brova and Patrick, can you please help me out here? I want to get through this presentation, thank you. Thank you, everybody. Okay, can we run the advertising now, please?","[Presentation]","Bruce F. Fleming","Yes, that's an important point. We're very fortunate we were able to get placement now of OxiClean in the bleach aisle, and I think it's going to be a positive win for both consumers and retailers. And 2014, across all our OxiClean variants, we can expect to see our advertising increase by 53%, and that's a pretty big number when you consider that we're the #2 laundry advertiser in the United States. It's what you do, what you have to do, when you're small, and what you have to do when you have a wonderful equity like OxiClean.","Okay, I'm privileged to talk about our third mega brand, which is TROJAN. For 90 years, it's been known for trusted protection, and over the last 5 years, you've seen us introduce a lot more elements to the brand equity, especially those revolving around pleasure. So it's not only a product for protection, it's a product for enhancing people's sexual health and sexual lives. We've added products in that manner. We've also added communication that reinforces both those points. If you look over the last 5 years or so, there's been decent growth, but I believe we can do better, and that's why we\u2019re introducing products into other segments. Steve's going to talk about innovation right now.","Steven P. Cugine","Thanks, Bruce. We did indeed experience strong success with the launch of our new TROJAN lubricants line in 2013.","The insight behind this launch is that lubricants don't have to be about solving a problem, but can be all about making good sex great. As we develop the launch, every product package and communication decision was grounded in consumer research. And with the combination of a great concept, great packaging and outstanding product performance, TROJAN Lubricants was created. The result? TROJAN is helping make good sex even better. We introduced this line of lubricants in early 2013, and consumers love it. We achieved a 7.4% dollar share of the lubricants market in Q4 of 2013, and we're poised for more growth with the launch of 3 new items.","2 items in the premium tier and 1 item in the value tier, Arouses & Releases, lotion activated superintensifier that heightens the whole experience. Simply Pleasure, 2 simple preservative-free ingredients, providing long-lasting lubrication. We're also launching one new product in the large value segment of the category called TROJAN Explore, a gel lubricant that delivers excellent lubrication. Bruce, I'll turn it back to you for advertising.","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay. So this year's tagline, TROJAN. Real. Good. Sex. I guess that's pretty simple. Clearly, it's been an evolution for us. We're going to continue to experiment with our communication, as I've said. And what we're trying to do is normalize the discussion about something that happens every day, and it's often about things people don't want to talk about, but we want to try to shape the discussion so it's in a positive manner. So what you're going to see, I'm going to show you the ad campaign across the 3 different products in our line. Some of you may really like it, some of you may say, it makes me uncomfortable, but that's exactly what we want to do. We want to be provocative, and that's what TROJAN will always try to do in order to build the business. Could you roll the tape, please?","[Presentation]","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay, let me talk about our fourth mega brand, which is our Vitamin business. This has been a fantastic acquisition. It's been great to work on, great to understand. I think, when the day is done, sometime in the future, it's going to be a case study for incredibly wonderful success in building a category and building segments of the category. We bought this business, it's already been growing rapidly. The Li'l Critters business, parents grew up loving Li'l Critters and their kids loving Li'l Critters, because some vitamins are hard to take. And some vitamins are easy to take, and Li'l Critters and Vitafusion are easy to take. They had an insight into the gummy form, and within 10 years, became market leader in the kids segment. It's our job to make that success happen in the adult segment as well. All those parents, they grew up loving Li'l Critters for their kids.","And since 2008, there's been some very wonderful growth. I mean, 31%, 32% compounded annual growth rate, you don't see this type of growth often. So when we had the opportunity to buy it, we jumped on it.","I'd like to talk a little bit about packaging, because as a marketer you always have to tinker with the packaging. But in this case, there's a strategic intent here.","When we bought the business, we saw that they had a trademarked tagline, they really had never used, which was, \"We make Nutrition Taste Good.\" And it really was a unique -- its own proposition for these businesses. So how were we going to try, over the next couple of years, to link these businesses, the Li'l Critters and Vitafusion businesses, so that they can build upon one another? One way is in a very small way, but in a very prominent way, right on the package, every day when they open the jars and they recognize that this is just not something that they do routinely. They look forward to their vitamins because it tastes good. So Steve's now going to talk about the innovation that we have for this year.","Steven P. Cugine","Thanks, Bruce. We learned that 84% of adult vitamin mineral and supplement users take a multivitamin plus at least one other product. Our answer to this insight is the introduction of Vitafusion multiplus line of gummy vitamins. These great-tasting gummy multivitamins contain all the essential vitamins and minerals you need, plus extra nutrition at the level recommended by the Institute of Medicine to support specific health needs.","We are also introducing this multiplus approach to kids' vitamins, as you can see here. Li'l Critters, Gummy Vites, plus additional benefits of bone support, immune support and omega-3 DHA support. Now back to you, Bruce, for the advertising.","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay, well we've got a great product, with great taste, and we just have to make people know about it, try it. Once they try it, we know they love it. So our targeting exercise here is really relatively easy. We've got an incredibly loyal amount of parents who have grown up with this brand over the last 10, 12 years. And now they're reaching the age where they need to think about their own health. In fact, they're not giving care to their kids, but they have to start giving care themselves, maybe getting care to their parents. So as caregivers, they start thinking of, \"What else can I do, to make my life a better, healthier life?\" And Vitafusion should be the answer, if we do our job well. I'd like to show the advertising. Could you roll the advertising, please?","[Presentation]","Bruce F. Fleming","Okay. So as you can see, we're beginning to try to tie the businesses together in a way that makes sense logically, and can hopefully build upon one another. They're great products, which we're convinced that if we get the adults, who have cared for their kids to use it, that it would be successful. Here's an opportunity for adults to love the product for their own good health, for the same reason they love the product for their kids' health. Nothing fancy about that advertising, very straightforward, very database, but tested very well, and we know that's it's communicating -- it's communicating well.","And as a result, we're putting our money where our mouth is. As Jim has told you about your focus, our focus has been relentless. We're going to spend more than 37% -- 37% more on our vitamin advertising to drive that growth, which is already extraordinary. Go ahead, Steve.","Steven P. Cugine","So for 2014, we couldn't be more excited about our portfolio of innovation. We have, for the first time, major news and new products in each one of our 4 mega brand categories: ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, TROJAN and Vitamins. However, we don't have time here to go through all of our new products, but rest assured that we have great new news on Nair, FIRST RESPONSE and Orajel and XTRA.","We're very excited today, as we have this analyst call to talk about how much our retailers appreciate and love our new products, and they voted with their feet. We have strong trade acceptance of all of our product items for 2014.","So, in summary, I think you could see why we believe that Church & Dwight has built a corporate competency for new product innovation. The new product innovation has been and will continue to be a critical driver of our organic growth. Innovation supports our mega brands growth drivers. 2014 represents the most significant portfolio of new products in the company's history. This portfolio of exciting new products represents platforms for growth and innovation that will extend multiple years into the future. With that, I turn it over to Matt.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Okay. You couldn't have sat through that presentation and not feel like there's something different about this year for Church & Dwight. So right, the numbers.","Okay. So let's start with the 2014 outlook. So 3% to 4% is a very familiar target for us, so for top line organic growth. That excludes acquisitions, it excludes foreign currency. Gross margin, you see is flattish. As you heard Jim say, we do have a robust continuous improvement program called Good to Great. That's functioning well within the company. So absent the sliding that we talked about in the release, we would expect gross margin to have been up in 2014.","Marketing is going to be flat, so it's going to be around 12.5%. That's where we ended 2013. We're expecting a lot of leverage from SG&A, and you see the operating margin up 80 basis points. Now between operating margin and EPS, you got taxes, interest, JV and others. So taxes, tax rate is expected to be higher, 2014, 34.5%. So that's a bit of a drag. On the other hand, the interest is going to be flat, but the JV income and other, expected to be up year-over-year, so that's all kind of baked into that range of $2.96 to $3.07. And as a result of raising the dividend, you can see we're at a 1.9% yield approximately right now.","Okay, here's the history for organic sales, 3% to 4% is what we're targeting for 2014. And you can see we have 2% for '13, not necessarily happy with that result, and you can see innovation is going to drive the return to 3% to 4% in 2014.","Here's the range, it's $2.96 to $3.07. And just -- I want to spend a minute or 2 on that. You saw in the release that we have $12 million year-over-year investment in slotting, so that alone is a 2% drag on EPS.","Second thing is we talk about currency, we're different than lots other CPG companies. We're more U.S. centric, but we do have a drag and a bigger drag in '14 versus '13. So that's about a 1.5% drag on our EPS. So those 2 are both baked in there. And then you can see at the bottom of the slide, I don't know if you can read it, the range is influenced by retail distribution and a consumer acceptance of the new products. So retailers are jazzed about the new products, but what's unclear, obviously, is going to be the planograms and then of course, consumer acceptance. So that's going to be the wildcard and that's going to come clear as we move through the first quarter, and by the time we talk to you at the end of the first quarter.","Okay, 11% increase in dividends we announced today, and just going to wrap on what we heard. So we had a solid fourth quarter. We're at 13 consecutive year of double digit growth. The Avid acquisition is just raging. We were up 20% net sales in 2013, and we expect double digit growth again in 2014.","Playing to win, as Jim said, we've got an aggressive but achievable plan, and we have our largest new product pipeline ever. And as opposed to the past, we talked about the power brands a lot, and you're going to hear us talking about the 4 mega brands now going forward. And like I said, we're off to a good start with the retailers. We'll find out more about planograms as we move through the quarter. And we have a lot of firepower, as we described earlier, generating lots and lots of cash, and we're always on the hunt for new acquisitions. And with that, we'll take your questions.","James R. Craigie","So back here, so let me just recap myself, right, see all these hands to the crowd. We could have easily folded the tent this year. We could have -- we had a lot of headwinds, more competition than we've ever seen in the past, the categories and the economy are still sluggish. Foreign exchange has popped it's ugly head up in the past month or 2. We could've easily walked up here and said, hey we're going to fold back, but we didn't. We came out with the greatest product launches of history. We're still holding to a 6% to 10% range on EPS. We can tighten that range and we can do more. We just need to know more right now about actual shelving out there by retailers, what the competition's doing, what pricing is, merchandising, consumer acceptance on that. So give us a couple months to kind of understand all those facts. We don't have that right now, with all of these new product launches going out there. So we're very excited, very excited about this, and it's taking a full assault out there. So all right, questions? Bill?","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Analyst","It's to Matt, what -- would be [ph] quick to share count for 2014 is? And then 2, Jim, can you tell us a little bit more about the decision to move from -- sorry. First question was, share count for 2014. Second is, maybe a little bit more, decision on to move from 8 power brands to mega and power? And when I say that, like, what does it mean internally? Does it mean you're going to pull back on advertising and R&D and stuff on like some of the other power brands, or the remaining power brands? And structurally, how should we look at it going forward? Should we expect faster growth out of the mega brands versus -- how should we think about that?","James R. Craigie","Let me deal with the mega brand question first. We are driven by share of voice versus share of market. We always look at -- no matter what you spend, it all depends. We're just kind of relative to competition. So as you look out there, the power brands that are staying as power brands and mega brands, we sold a very strong share of voice going into 2014 to support the new product. We have it. It's on the table here in front of you. But Steve and Bruce want to spend their time appropriately on mega brands. So we have great new products there and with the marketing spending we're doing on those brands, we expect, it will still drive good share growth gains there. The mega brand thing is just purely a very smart move. It's a very good, efficient move. How to best spend their money. Out there, we'll get a bigger bang for the buck for the money in all aspects. The marketing will drive more share growth that if we spend on the smaller brand. The organizational costs are less. So it's just again, it's not a revolution. It's an evolution of our strategy, it makes total sense. I think you see some of our big competitors out there, I mean Colgate's a great mega brands around the world as well. We see these 4 brands as the key driver of our future. Not the total, the key driver. The other power brands we have, we're spending the appropriate amount of money, we're doing the appropriate amount of new products to keep -- they'll keep delivering that. So we feel very good about that. This is a tweak of our strategy that's very smart, to drive good strong growth going forward. Matt, on the share?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, I'm going to disappoint you, Bill, with respect to the share count. So this flexibility in the amount of the shares and the timing, which we would actually buy shares back. This year, we haven't bought any shares so far, for the first month of the year, but we do intend to buy some, but it is a multi-year program. So we'll update everybody when we -- end of the first quarter.","Unknown Analyst","But is it -- any EPS guidance?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","There's a range. Connie [ph]?","Unknown Analyst","A couple of questions. First for Matt, on the fourth quarter. Could you discuss the dynamics -- sorry, could you discuss the dynamics of the household products business? Because it looks as though price mix was much more negative in Q4 than Q3. So I guess, I want to know like what's going on in the business? Were you selling out older inventory to ship in new products? So if you would discuss that along with the shelf space gains you're expecting or have got commitments from retail for the new products?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, when -- at midpoint of the year, you may recall we had a 3% to 4% target for full year, and we took it down to 2%. And when we did that, we made plans to put a lot more trade promotion out in the second half. So that was in a knee-jerk in the fourth quarter, something we made the decision in the middle of the year. So if you went back and looked at the first couple of quarters, you'd see that, actually, the price mix is pretty tepid in Q1 and Q2, and was big in Q3 and Q4, and that's because we were disadvantaged on shelf, particularly in the litter category, and we had to correct that in the second half.","James R. Craigie","Connie, too, there's been tremendous pricing in the laundry category. We're not leading it. A couple of our competitors have pulled down their promotion prices, and so we've had to deal with that. So it did hurt the gross margin a bit. We're not going to start a price war, but we're not going to be left uncompetitive. So we did have to spend more on the promotional side in laundry, to stay competitive in the category. We'll still drive share growth. ARM & HAMMER liquid, it's just had its 16th consecutive quarter of share growth, 4 years of share growth. So we didn't want competitors who, some of them had nothing but price to deal with right now. They don't have innovations and they tried to pull the price lever and we made sure we were not on a price -- uncompetitive. So it did cost us some gross margin on the back half of the year. Alice? Alice, waiting for the monitor?","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So in the -- your guidance for the first quarter for 1% organic sales growth, what in that is volume and price mix? Because I'm assuming volume's up quite a bit in there. And then for the year, could you break that out as well? And then I have a question about pricing.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, if you look at that -- we saw, what was the fourth quarter, we saw about a 5% volume and about 3% negative price mix. You expect to see something like that in the first quarter, it's #1. Number 2, it's 1% organic growth, is what you saw in the release for Q1. There's a 200 basis points drag from trade, coupons and slotting, in that number. So you've got a big boat anchor around the top line number. And if you look at the gross margin, which is, we were projecting it to be down 100 basis points, it's more -- there is more than 100 basis points of hurt from the 3 items I just mentioned, slotting, trade and coupons. So -- and you would expect that, and when you -- with all innovation that we talked about today, you would expect it to be a big investment in the front half of the year, and that's why, I mean and some people wrote that we have it back in a year from an EPS standpoint, not at all concerned about that, because we're putting investment up front.","James R. Craigie","Alice, we'll only get a partial quarter benefit of volume from the new products that is beginning to ship, so we take the full shot on slotting in the first quarter, so that's what Matt's saying that's having a drag on the organic number. But the second quarter, we'll have the full benefit of a quarter's worth of volume from that, and actually a reversal. You only have a slighter drag in the second quarter from continued slotting for the accounts that are later getting out there. Your second question, and then I'll ask Mr. Schmitz.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So you gave some indication of the price on the shelf of the new OxiClean detergent? I think you said, it could be about a 20% discount to what I guess is Tide. If -- could you give us that, the price of OxiClean detergent on the per-wash basis versus basic Tide? Because Tide has a huge range of prices, so is it going to be priced at a discount to basic Tide, on a price per-wash basis? That's my question.","James R. Craigie","It's a tough one. Our objective on OxiClean detergent is to offer the performance of the leading brand at about a 20% discount. And again, you're right. They have different forms. And in the end, we don't control pricing. The trade mix makes the pricing decisions. Procter has announced a kind of an implicit price increase. They've taken ounces out of their Tide line, and held the price, so that's going out also in the marketplace. So right now, and that's all just beginning to happen on shelf. So I honestly can't give you, at this point in time, an exact price per load answer like that. We need to see what happens on the shelf and how the retailers price the product and what happens. So -- but our goal was to be about a 20% lower on price, but equal performance, so that's kind of the target. That's what Church & Dwight is all about, great performance at a great value. So we think we have a great new laundry detergent. We want a piece of that premium tier, so offering that great performance but at a better value.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And where are you going to see it on the shelf? When are we going to see it on the shelf?","James R. Craigie","Literally, probably late February, early March out there. So it's going to be happening soon. Bill Schmitz?","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you think the laundry category will grow in 2014? Because the crazy price you've seen in the last couple of months, all it's done is shrunk the category, right? So price mix is down and volume is still down.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, it's a tough question, Bill. Because the category is starting to show little improvement. It was as bad as 4% down in the first half of 2013. It was down about 2.5% down in the back half of 2013, the fourth quarter. There's pluses and minuses going on. I think the launch of OxiClean could be a plus in the category, more of a premium price. You can probably assume that Tide simply will pull pricing down, because as Tide users switch, and I think I heard Procter say they thought as much as 40% of the users of Tide simply would come from base Tide. Well, that's about a 40% price decline from the base, so that will be a drag on the category. But honest, we don't know yet. I -- it's a very -- it's one of those questions -- I've said it before, where's the source of volume for the brands, what happens to the category. We're trying to grow the category, we're trying to bring innovation to the category, both with ARM & HAMMER and especially innovation on OxiClean out there and that, so. We're trying to grow the category, and we're not the ones driving the price down, so we want to see that category grow again. So that will be good for everybody, good for the retailers and good for us.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I'll just follow up on the advertising spending. Obviously, when you have a hit, your net sales from your gross sales, the denominator, right, is lower? So your advertising ratio should come up anyway? And then you look at the back half of the year, is there enough flexibility in the earnings? Because you have these great launches coming out, and you're spending all this sliding, all this trade money, but you're going to have to support it, obviously, right, once they're going to get shelf space. So I thought it was a little bit odd that you said the ratio was going to be flat for the full year.","James R. Craigie","Well, the ratio was about flat for the year, but we're going to have our revenues going up, so the amount of money will go up. But probably the reason we're leaving a range too on the 6% to 10% is to leave us for some flexibility on marketing spending. For good news or bad news, if we see some of these businesses take off, we're going to put more marketing money behind them. If we see some competitive actions, we have to put some more to defend our businesses. So part of it again, there's a lot going on out there in the category, across all categories, leaving ourselves a little room to wiggle right now until we see more of the whites of the eyes of competition, what the trade does on that, so it's part of the reason why this year, last year, we called 14%, boom. From day 1, we delivered 14%, boom. Because we knew what our competition was doing. We had more stability out there in the marketplace. And now this year, a lot of things are up in the air going around, so we need a little room right now, especially with the greatest product launches we've ever done in our history with that, so. Stay tuned, we'll try to refine things a little bit more. As we get into the year, we see what's actually happening. But this point in time, we just need to have more of a range than we have in the past. Yes, sir?","Unknown Analyst","So a couple of things. With the mega brands now then, sort of having the amount of new products, it seems as though this year relative to prior years, it really hits earlier in the year, in aggregate. Is that a fair way to characterize it?","James R. Craigie","No, there's just more. It's just more. We've never launched this many new products in the year to start with, so it's just the magnitude of the number of launches we're doing versus past years, that's it. It's not earlier, it's just more.","Unknown Analyst","And secondly, so now with the greater focus there and the timeline that you set out, as far as the new product innovation, would it be reasonable to assume -- and actually let me take a step back. One of the other things we mentioned was the use of money-back guarantees on some of the products. I just wondering if you can take us through. There seems to be a lot of confidence in these products, but it seems to be something relatively new for you as a company, so I wanted to get some thoughts on that.","James R. Craigie","No, we've got a quite a lot of experience on that. We've had guarantees on our product in the past, so we have a good history on what the redemption rates on that are. We feel very comfortable with that, and we feel very comfortable about how great our products are. So that's -- we're not concerned about that. That's just really putting your money where your mouth is. And I love this part. If you're a cat lover, you've got to try this cat litter. It is by far the best I've heard. I've given samples out to friends, and they had to -- they would tell me the truth, and it's unbelievable. The laundry detergent's the same way, unbelievable. So we feel very comfortable. I just -- we try to convey to consumers, try this. We're so confident, you will love this, we'll give you money back, and we've done that in the past with some brands. And we know what the redemption rates are, we feel very comfortable with that. Is that your whole question? Or was there a part?","Unknown Analyst","One last part. As far as the -- I noticed that a couple of the products, while you have some of the branding, particularly with ARM & HAMMER, sort of the yellow and what have you, a couple of products, Clump & Seal, and the I believe, sort of had the black, right? Is that more of a, sort of a call out to something, more premium? Or was there kind of a thought process?","James R. Craigie","That's exactly that. We -- the color black in packaging has conveyed premium in a lot of different categories out there, and we wanted these products to stand out in the shelf. So that's why we went that way. But you'll still see, it still has the famous ARM & HAMMER logo on it on that, so it still very identifiable as ARM & HAMMER, but these are premiums products out there, with premium performance, and we want it to stand out. We looked at both, honestly. It was very close. I'll tell you, the final testing was very close between the orange and the black colored packaging, and we decided in the end to go with the black, and we'll see. We'll have it [indiscernible] off, and I think it'll make these new products really stand out in the shelf, while still not losing the identity of the ARM & HAMMER brand on them. Right, back to this side?","Unknown Analyst","On the full year organic sales outlook, you adjusted it down just a tiny bit, at least at the midpoint. So can you talk about what changed in that, is it a function of increased promo or are there different expectations in terms of volume? And then just a follow-up on Vitamins, you had mentioned in your presentation that Vitamins were up 20% in 2013. But growth has slowed somewhat in the track channel. So first is, the track channel's indicative of what you guys are seeing across the board? And it looks like competition has picked up, so can you talk a little bit about vitamins, overall, in terms of the competitive side?","James R. Craigie","Okay, I think I heard the first part of that dealt with the 3% to 4%, while we have a range on that. And what could affect that range?","Unknown Analyst","Yes.","James R. Craigie","A lot of stuff. I mean, the categories to start with, I will tell you, our category growth assumptions overall next year, in total, across all of our 13 categories we're in, we're assuming that we're from flat to 1% growth. And I would assume that a category growth, so if that gets better or worse, that will do it. How well our new products do in the marketplace, we all think they will do great, maybe some will do greater than we think, some less. Competition, what's going to happen out there, pricing. So there's a lot more variability in the marketplace right now, and 3% to 4% to us is still pretty tight range. I think most of our competitors have a 2 or 3 point range on organic growth. So we feel pretty tight on that. Obviously, we hope can beat it, but I think that's, historically we've been in that kind of band overall, so we feel good. We talked about the vitamin category. Well, part of it's law of numbers as we get bigger, we had over 20% growth in business last year. A lot of that business is in unmeasured channels. Well over, I think, well Bruce, I think well over half of the business to us is unmeasured channels, through large customers, such as club stores and that. So part of the -- probably the Nielsen you see on that is not a true representation of what category growth is. I'll be honest, the category has taken a little hit just recently. You saw there was some negative press out there about the benefits of certain kind of vitamins, and the category has had a little hit. But I would tell you historically, we studied this very hard as we got in this business. That has its ups and downs. News comes out, good news, bad news and that, but overall, I think people are very smart. For what it cost you to take a vitamin, it's a very low cost, and there are people who don't believe in it, but I think most people believe. You can't lose in taking vitamins, especially as you get older. I could also sit here and tell you we studied hard the basis of those negative PR stuff came out there. And if you studied the group, the people they sampled, it was not representative of the overall population. But that's the problem with these studies. They come out on a [indiscernible] points of view, and -- but I don't want to get into that today. But the Vitamin category, with the aging population, the desire for greater health has been one of the best long-term growth categories out there. It goes through little blips, ups and down, but we feel great. The business is growing. Don't forget too on the adult side, only 3% of adults take a gummy vitamin. 97% of adults take, like a hard pill, so we have a -- and that's a $6 billion business out there, category. So we feel like we have tremendous runway on just -- even if the category's stayed flat, we've still got 97% of people out there taking a hard pill. And every time we -- give a chance, take the gummy versus the hard pill, they're blown away by the great taste difference on it, and that's what Bruce tried to show you in the advertising. So even our worst case, the category was flat, we saw tremendous runway on the adult side of the business, which today is bigger, bigger than the kid side of the business. The kid category is only 1\/6 the size of the adult category, so with already half of all kids taking gummies. So that category is pretty well penetrated, and it's much smaller, the huge opportunities on the adult side with tremendous 97% of the business out there to be had, just convert people from pills to gummies, and we feel that's the huge runway in that business. That's why it's growing so quickly these days. All right?","Unknown Analyst","Matt, could you talk a little bit about the SG&A leverage, because what's implied in the guidance is -- that being -- you always do a good job on leveraging your SG&A dollars, but this is bigger than I think we've seen, ever, maybe?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. Well, you know that we make a big deal out about sales per employee, and overhead controls is a hallmark of Church & Dwight. And Jim had a slide, he had a few examples up there, of some things that are going on within the company. So for example, you saw a new health care program. We're probably one of the few large corporations that have moved to private exchanges immediately from 2014. A lot of people just kind of looking at it. We've always been very aggressive with respect with how we manage our health care costs. A couple of years ago, we went through a consumer-directed health care cost where the first $1,500 is paid for entirely by the company. So it would incent the employee not to actually get to the threshold. So you'd be more deliberate about how you spend your money. So information systems are up there, so the Avid business that we brought on, we went live mid-year on July for that entire business without a hitch, and we carried more people than we needed in the first half of the year and that kind of peeled off in the back, have a full year benefit next year. We also have a no headcount plan for 2014. So that 4,200 number you saw for headcount is what I'm looking for, for the end of 2014. And if you go back to last year, if you said, when I was up here, talking about 2013, we actually were calling at the time, a gross margin of flat. We turned out to be up 80 basis points, and then we spent 30 back on marketing. And at the time we were thinking, we're going to get the entire operating margin expansion from SG&A, we turned out, that we needed that. But this year, that's where the focus is, is on SG&A.","Unknown Analyst","Lots of exciting innovation here today. One thing that we haven't seen hos been liquid PODs. Unit dose appears like it's here to stay. The consumer, based on market share data, would suggest that they voted for liquid as the preference. So looking forward, do you think you have a material portfolio disadvantage without liquid PODs. And if so, what's preventing you from going down that path?","James R. Craigie","No, I would dispute your numbers. The POD category, unit dose, as we call it, has leveled off at about 9%. I would expect it to up go a little bit with launch of gains [ph], new POD product out there, but still probably end up around 10% to 11% of the category. We're a player in that. We're in a powder POD. We have seen no issue with consumers accepting the powder side of it. And the second -- and then it's so -- one thing, honestly we've been deficient at is, we don't have larger size packages of the POD. So you're going to see that from us next year. We have more than our fair share of the smaller size of the category. We don't have a larger size, so we're going to be launching more of that, but it is -- it's here to stay. It's found a niche out in the business place. It's again, 9% now, maybe 10% or 11% in 2014. Let's not forget, liquid is 75% of the laundry category, so we're going to be competitive in POD, so our focus is getting back and growing the liquids side of the category. Again, that's 3\/4 of consumers want liquid. That's where we're going to put our focus in the business. So a good question, but I think we feel fine on that, and we're going to fix the deficiency we have on larger size PODs out there.","Unknown Analyst","Question. The $12 million increase in slotting fees, I thought slotting fees across retailers are coming down as there's traffic shifting to online and whatnot, so what's that $12 million getting you? Because I know you commented that you're not sure whether you get incremental shelf space or not for the new products.","James R. Craigie","It's literally an age-old thing. The -- still the predominant number of retailers demand a slotting fee to take on a new product, whether it sells more or less, that's -- their attitude is, that's your problem.","Unknown Analyst","Even if it's replacing something else in the line?","James R. Craigie","It could. That's where final shelving is one of the big things we don't know yet. We know -- I could show you a chart, I won't, but I could show you a chart, we've got great, very good acceptance, they want the product. Whether it takes the place of our product, where there's incremental shelving, is still to be determined out there. We feel good, but we don't know. We don't control that. And we -- the retailers are often dealing with new products from competitors and that, so -- the next step is what the shelving on the set. The set after that is how do consumers react to that all. So 2 big decisions to come, we literally -- again, because we don't control it, we've made very compelling cases, so they like the product, we feel very good that they've accepted all these new products. We don't know whether it's just going to be -- one in, one out as they say, or that we get incremental shelving from these things. We're still waiting to see it answered, and then bottom line, how the consumer reacts. Still to come.","Unknown Analyst","And then just, on the advertising, you talked about huge increases, percentage-wise for OxiClean and for Avid. I think those were the only 2 numbers you gave us. But overall, advertising is flat. So what -- where is it coming down? Which brands are pulling...","James R. Craigie","It goes back to my share of voice share market. We have shaved a few brands where we felt we were spending -- I'll give you one example, on TROJAN last year, we spent a tremendous amount of incremental advertising to launch Lubricant, and that was purposeful in that. So it was a major, massive launch into a new white space category. And so we're pulling back on that a little bit. We would have done that any way, so we're doing that, where we have major new news. We put bigger money behind those and we're able to do that while still maintaining a bigger share of voice in the market and our share of market in the condom side of the business, especially. So we feel confident. This is why, one thing about our company too -- Bruce Fleming controls all marketing spending of the company. It's not -- I grew up in another company. There were 12 divisions, all 12 divisions had their separate pots, and they wouldn't exchange money at all. Bruce will move money by the day, by the week. As he see things happening, whether good news, put more money behind it, or bad news, needs to be defended, or whatever. So he constantly watches that, he constantly pulls the money left and right between all different businesses we have out there, so we have the best bang for the buck. So that's my promise -- right now, we made a decision, as of this moment, where the brands go. As we see things happen in the marketplace, we'll make assessments on it, and shift money as appropriate. But we think, it all starts with share of voice, the share of market. We feel we have at least a strong -- and in many cases, in the mega brands, our share of voice will be 1.5x our share of market, and we believe you've got to be, kind of be at those levels, to grow your share. That's us through history, so we studied this intently, we don't want you to bore you with the details today, but we watch that very closely, that ratio. Jason?","Unknown Analyst","Can you talk about the growth of the personal care segment, excluding Avid, so how you saw -- there was a lot of innovation that came through in 2013. And obviously, you're talking a lot about 2014 as well. So I guess, it just seems that on the premium side of the equation, that's where, I think, a lot of people are still uncertain about the consumer that's out there. So can you just talk about how much reliance you need on that? Personal care -- is innovation really the work to kind of be, come within your implied guidance?","James R. Craigie","Yes, we feel good. I mean, we had a positive year of growth for TROJAN, as a total brand. We had a good year on, actually, toothpaste. We are one of the fastest-growing toothpaste businesses out there percentage-wise. We're still a small player, but our toothpaste business did very well. It was not a good year in NAIR, the weather really hurt the NAIR business, any kind of a seasonal business. So that business was a step back. And on the pregnancy kit business, we hit an all-time record share on FIRST RESPONSE this time. So overall, the personal care business is doing just fine. We're very happy with Avid, and then of course, we consider Vitamins more on that side of the equation too. And so, the personal care business is doing fine, with some little lumps on the road caused by seasonal activity. So that's why you didn't see. ARM & HAMMER Truly Radiant toothpaste, best toothpaste we've launched in a decade. We're launching a toothbrush along with it. That'll be big, and Nair's going to be a whole argan [ph] oil line coming out, which is very hot out there, very good trade acceptance on that so far. We didn't even talk about it. FIRST RESPONSE, we are just launching the first pregnancy kit that has a 6-day claim on it. We could tell you, 6 days before your missed period, if you're pregnant or not. Nobody else has 5 days. It took us over 3 years to get clearance on that through the FDA. We're the only one in the marketplace with that. Every time there's been a day improvement on that thing, the brand has had it. Has delivered tremendous growth. So again, we didn't even talk about that today, but it's the best new pregnancy kit out there that'll help that business, so a lot of great new news across it. I'll tell it to you, you can't, don't forget, one thing about OxiClean we love, the base powder business, it's a household business with personal care margins. The margins on base OxiClean are plus 60% on the business. So it's a category, it's a household category, and has personal care type margin structure to it. So -- brand, so you can't just categorize stuff. It's just household with \"lower margins\", personal care with higher margins. Even some of the household businesses have very large margins. But overall, feel good. But overall, feel good about the business. Joe [ph]?","Unknown Analyst","Just going back to marketing for a second, you mentioned that it's supposed to be up this year, in terms of dollars, but flat as a percentage of sales. And I know it's distorted a little bit by specialty. But given the move to the mega brands, is there a change to get more efficiency in that number actually trends down over time, in terms of a percentage of sales? And then secondly, in terms of gross margin, how much is left on Good to Great?","James R. Craigie","On the marketing side, we honestly, again flat on dollars, flat on percentage, up on dollars overall, with more, I think I said, 80-some percent of total marketing, what the slide said, on the mega brands. You could, Joe, fall into that argument that you could reduce spending over time but we don't see it. We want to just keep increasing our marketing. And I hope you're blown away by that chart today. Church & Dwight's the 13th biggest advertiser in the U.S., bigger than companies that you would never think spend less than we do on that. What's the other part of the question?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","The other question was, where is the end of the road for Good to Great? And in our company, there's no end to that road. So if you look at what happened in 2013, we had somewhat benign commodity inputs. And so the efforts of the Good to Great folks popped, right, at 80 basis points, so it's margin expansion. And the fact that we were able to hang on to our margin for the last wars is a tribute to the Good to Great program. Now, we can't depend on commodities being benign. In fact, we're expecting some moderate inflation in '14 versus '13, more than we saw at '13 versus '12, and it's also baked into our assumptions. But I would say, we always approach Good to Great over a 36-month period, and we can only de-bottleneck in a linear fashion. Once you de-bottleneck one thing, or you improve something, something else becomes the next target. So I wouldn't call out a number and say, okay, this is the maximum we can get to, so I wouldn't underestimate the talents of the people. Wouldn't try to gripe, but we approach it every year, we're going to try to expand gross margin.","James R. Craigie","Yes, I want to emphasize a point I mentioned too, 25% of all employees' bonus in Church & Dwight is based on the hitting the gross margin target. We studied incentive compensation structure. Of all of our competitors, nobody else has gross margin as the specific bonus target. We started that about 5, 6 years ago. It's been a key driver of our great results, so trust me, you have every employee in Church & Dwight focused on gross margin. It's as important a driver as the revenue. It's as important a driver of EPS. It's as important a driver of the cash flow. So that's what Matt said. It's an all-the-time focus on doing it, and people know. They can help us on gross margin. It generates better earnings, where we spend more on the marketing side. So I'll tell you, my marketing team, I think Bruce would agree with this, probably spend as much time working with operations on how to improve the gross margin as they do with their advertising agencies in how to improve the advertising, that's Steve's put on new products, because we made it, equally as important as that. And that's why we've had the great results I showed you on gross margin as part of our bonus structure. I'm actually amazed nobody else has it, because gross margin can drive a lot of opportunities in the company to be able to spend more money on marketing or drive more earnings on that. Other companies don't want to deal with it, but it's very, very -- we watch everything from trade promotion spending to how to cut cost in our products without degrading the quality, massive effort going on, 365 days a year. Next time, we're getting better acoustics in this room.","Unknown Analyst","Two quick questions. On the gross margin, is the innovation driving any of the flatness in gross margin? Are you innovating up the gross margin value chain or not?","James R. Craigie","Well, again, our policy overall is that new products must have a higher gross margin than the product it replaces, but as Matt said, you get all these products out. The slotting fees are offsetting some of that margin improvement in the products in that, so. And sometimes, there are startup costs on the new product which may pull the gross margin down short term. But long term, they'll have higher gross margins. So that's good news. Question two?","Unknown Analyst","And it just seems significant that you've had all these years of double digit earnings growth, and this is the year where you're not necessarily expecting that. That just seems like a big change.","James R. Craigie","Well, I'd still say, we're kind of late announcing our earnings versus everybody else. 6% to 10% in my eyes, still puts us in the top quartile of what people are promising in earnings. And we get the same issues they all do with currency out there, the economy and everything else there. So we feel very comfortable that relative to our competition, our goal is always to be in the top quartile of earnings performance. So we feel 6% to 10% still puts us in the top quartile, deal with the same issues they're dealing and then, having to support all the launches which we're doing in our eyes more product launches across our portfolio than everybody else. So we still feel they're very good, we're top quartile performance, and we did say 6% to 10%, so stay tuned.","Unknown Analyst","Okay so, but also, just thinking about '15 then, if you probably, this could be a peak innovation year, in terms of just the big -- the mega brand launches, do you think '15, all things being equal, would be back to double digit?","James R. Craigie","Well, we won't be able to top it as far as more launches, because we're launching every category this year. But don't forget, we'll only get about 3 quarters, maybe 50% of the year benefiting these new products. Next year, we get the full benefit of the new products. And one thing Steve Cugine's been charged with, we don't want just a 1-year wonder out of these products. He showed a chart earlier that 1\/3 of our volume today is driven by the new products we launched the past 5 years. That's sticky factor. We want these products to stick, and to be able to build upon them going forward. So we get a full year benefit of all these product launches next year, without the hit of slotting fees that we put behind them out there. And we may launch different versions of these new products, as they stick and hit the ground. So the number of new products now, you couldn't possibly top what we're doing this year, in terms of number of new products, slotting fees should be less next year. And hopefully, we'll have a full year benefit of these new products going forward, because they are just awesome. They should really have some long-term stickiness and be able to grow share up in the marketplace.","Unknown Analyst","Could you please talk about the competitive intensity of the adult gummy vitamins versus other branded as well as private label? And then secondly, if people see a great advertising and want to buy your products online, what's the easiest way for them to get it?","James R. Craigie","Yes, the adult gummy category had certainly picked up with intensity. Products have been launched by major brands like One A Day and Centrum, but we welcome that. That's great news, because again remember my fact, only 3% of the adult category is gummies. 97% is hard pills. You see the guys who dominate the hard pill side, going to gummy, to me, it just tells adults, hey, gummies are great. As they come to gummies, we still feel we have the best tasting gummy product out there. I taste them myself all the time. The competitive product, some are brittle, like Skittles, some are not as chewy and sweet as ours. We really have some proprietary processing knowledge that I don't believe anybody else has, so. We're bringing people in. There's 97% of the business to be had. If there's more competition, it's only great to me, because it's just telling everybody, gummies are not a kiddie thing. They're for adults too, when you see the big brand names go out there and get into it. We do have manufacturing advantages. We're the only ones that make our own gummies. The other guys go through co-packers. So we have a lot more flexibility as to what we make, and to keep up with demand out there. And because we were first in the category, we have really strong relationships with the trade. They love us. They just love our products. We want to keep selling them. Our guys are doing a great job, coming out with new forms. I think this whole plus line, both the kids and adult side, is a very smart move. Because people, Steve said, the number was like -- 84% of people buy a multivitamin and then buy a supplemental vitamin for again, heart, bone, hair, skin and nails, we put them together. Now you just need to buy one product. And I'll tell you, it's not so easy to make a product that tastes great, and so it's the gummy form with some of the ingredients that are put into those, but our guys are just phenomenal. So it's a great testament, so -- but I welcome the competition. I really welcome the competition. I hope to sit here next year and say, the gummies' 10% of the category, because that means there's still 90% to go, but people are coming over. We're not happy until we see over half of all adult vitamins be in the gummy form, and we're still going to be a leader in that, so tremendous growth opportunity. Come on, way in the back.","Unknown Analyst","So on capital allocation, Matt, my first question is sort of why now, with the buyback, I guess, the balance sheet's in great shape, but it has been in the past, and you guys have generally been reluctant to pull the trigger on repurchasing the stock. Jim, for you, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on the M&A pipeline. That will be helpful. And then getting back to gummies for a moment, do you still think you can do double-digit growth this year, given some of the slowing that we're seeing in the data?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, on the buyback front, just recall, when we have $0.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, so that's probably our high watermark, for us. And as we continue to grow the amount of the free cash flow we generate annually, we have -- we need outlets for the cash, right? So there's a couple ways to go: dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. And being a BBB+ rated, we have access to the capital markets. The reason it's a $500 million program, is we had remaining $220 million on our existing program. So rather than have another small program, we extinguished that, and so let's have one $500 million, multi-year. And the Evergreen program that we announced, was in addition to that, that's simply to remove share creep. So last year, there were 1 million shares that were exercised, so you could expect about 1 million plus shares on an annual basis that we would be acquiring under the Evergreen program. The $500 million is there to reduce the total amount of shares outstanding, some of which we will do this year. We just haven't -- we haven't said anything about the timing or the amount.","James R. Craigie","And the gummy side, we definitely believe we can do double-digit growth. I mean we, over the course of 2013, we landed a lot of new distribution. That's one of the things in buying a company. This company's a very small company we bought. They didn't have our sales muscle out there, so our sales force has done a great job in getting the products that already had in better distribution, that we're launching a new plus line, I feel good. We're taking the advertising up 30-some percent. We promise you, we bought this business, it was only advertising about 6% of net revenue or 5% in advertising. We're now in the double digits on the advertising, having more than doubled the advertising spend in that category, so we feel good. Let me just end with one comment because you've been very patient and wonderful today. I'll just tell you, I mentioned earlier, about M&A market is very active on there today. You can't count on anything until the calorically challenged seller sings. So we're working hard on that, and -- but no promises, but it's more active than I've seen it in prior years, which is good news, and we have a lot money. We have a lot of dry powder out there, but we're very selective. We've always known if we find a great acquisition, we can grow it. We're not going to buy junk brands, old, dead brands that are not 1 or 2 in their category, but I'll just tell you we've been very, very active out there. But again, I can't promise anything. It's not built into our numbers, but the good news, is we have lots of dry powder. And also, we have the organizational time now. We're through the big absorption process of the gummy business. We're seeing a lot of focus to integrate into our systems, everything else. We're through that, and my team's hungry and ready for the next big acquisition.","So let me -- if you have more questions, please give us a call later. Again, I thank you for your patience, and thank you, who came today. I thank you on the line who are listening. I can't tell you how I'm excited. I've been waiting for this day for 6 months, because I've been -- you've all been asking questions along the way, of what we're going to do, what we're going to do, and I just couldn't tell you, I didn't want to tip off the competition. Well, now, the cannon's been fired. We're going to have a great 2014. We're excited, and stay tuned. It will be great. Thank you, all."],"4600":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filing.","As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to provide some color on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO, and when Rick's finished, we'll open up the call for questions. So Q1 was an outstanding quarter for our company and there is lots of good news. Our reported growth was 14.7%, which reflects the Waterpik acquisition and strong organic growth. Organic sales growth of 3.8% exceeded our outlook of approximately 2% and we also exceeded our EPS outlook. In the U.S., organic sales grew 3.6% with 5.3% volume growth.","I'll take a few minutes on the environment. It's instructive to take a moment to look at our playing field and see just how good the results are in Q1, despite what you're hearing about the environment. Of the 14 primary categories in which we compete, 10 of the 14 grew consumption year-over-year. More than half of those categories grew at 3% or better. We have low exposure to private label relative to our peers, which contributes to our success. And with respect to the pricing environment, 8 of our 11 power brands had flat or lower percentage of products sold on promotion in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017, and still we grew. Most important, 10 of our 11 power brands grew or maintained share in the quarter; 8 of the 11 grew share, so we are winning in the marketplace. This signals the relevance and long-term health of our brands, which is grounded in innovation, and gives us confidence in our long-term algorithm to grow our U.S. business by 2% annually; and, we expect to exceed that goal this year.","Now, let's take a look at a few categories. In liquid detergent, which accounts for almost three-quarters of the category, ARM & HAMMER liquid share hit a 12.2% share, our second highest quarterly share ever; Q1 is the 33rd consecutive quarter or more, and that'll be eight years of continued share growth. Turning to cat litter, the clumping cat litter category grew 3% in Q1. ARM & HAMMER litter grew faster than the category and, consequently, grew share.","In VMS, consumption was up for both vitafusion and L'il Critters. Two key drivers were our new ad campaign, which drove online sales up significantly, and of course, the flu season, which drove sales of vitafusion Power C and L'IL CRITTERS Immune C.","Dry shampoo consumption grew 32% in Q1 and dry shampoo is now a $170 million category in the U.S. Our BATISTE brand grew consumption 50% and now commands a 33% share of that category. We have launched new variants to continue to broaden our line, and BATISTE continues to be the number one dry shampoo in the world.","Our International Consumer business delivered 6.8% organic growth. International has emerged as a growth driver for our company over the past four years. The investments that we made in new leadership, regional hubs and our brand focus have been paying off. International markets are a positive for Church & Dwight, unlike many of our peers. Our algorithm is 6% annual organic growth for the International business and we expect to meet or beat that number in 2018. And by the way, our global consumer online sales continues to grow and is now in excess of 5% of sales.","Turning to Specialty Products, Q1 was a challenging quarter for us. Our animal productivity business saw a decline in demand due to low milk prices and higher feed costs. There is a silver lining, though. The acquisitions that we've made over the past couple of years, which got us into the poultry business, have reduced our dependence on the dairy economy. If you went back a couple years when we saw a similar decline in milk prices, sales declined approximately 5%. This quarter, the business declined less than 1%. So we continue to have confidence in our 5% long term growth algorithm for this business and we believe our diversification moves are working.","Turning to innovation, innovation continues to be a big driver of our success. We have new products shipping in several categories. We launched ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL LIGHTWEIGHT UNSCENTED cat litter with guaranteed seven-day odor control, which builds on the success of our CLUMP & SEAL franchise. We expanded our Odor Blasters laundry platform, leveraging technology that helps eliminate tough odors. We introduced new vitafusion and L'IL CRITTERS Probiotics gummy vitamins, which support digestive health. Waterpik launched a really cool product, a water flosser to restore whiteness while flossing with the new infuser technology. TROJAN has launched NIRVANA, which is an assortment of sensation condoms in an exclusive package design. And finally, BATISTE continues to expand distribution with three unique fragrances, leveraging its 2017 growth and our number one U.S. share position.","Now finally, Waterpik. Waterpik joined the Church & Dwight family last August. At the time, we had expectations that the business would grow faster than our evergreen target of 3%. The business is performing extremely well and we now expect high single digit sales growth in 2018. Last year, we found that the business is responsive to advertising and we expect to continue to invest. Previously, it was largely an unadvertised business. The power of the combination of the Waterpik and Church & Dwight teams is evident. We look at Waterpik as a global opportunity. We are laying the groundwork to sustain this strong growth rate in the future, particularly in the international markets where household penetration is much lower than the U.S.","So just to wrap it up, we're off to a great start this year. We continue to outperform the market because we have brands consumers love, we have the right strategies to grow and our people make Church & Dwight a great place to work.","Next up is Rick to give you details of our first quarter results, and the outlook for Q2 and the full year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I will start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.63 per share compared to $0.52 in 2017, up 24%. The $0.63 was better than our $0.61 outlook, largely due to our stronger than anticipated top line. Reported revenues were up 14.7% to $1 billion. Organic sales were up 3.8%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 2%. The organic sales beat was driven by our Domestic and International Consumer business. We are extremely pleased with our strong volume growth domestically of 5.3% and, as expected, our negative price mix continues to move in the right direction. And, we expect that improvement to continue as we move through the year.","Now, let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic business's organic sales increased by 3.6%, primarily due to ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, OxiClean stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, and vitafusion L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins. International organic growth was up 6.8%, driven largely by OxiClean and the export business, Sterimar, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OxiClean in Mexico, and Femfresh and BATISTE in Australia. For Specialty Products division, organic sales declined less than 1% due to lower volume. The U.S. dairy industry demand is significantly reduced due to low milk prices, as Matt mentioned, but our recent acquisitions continue to reduce volatility. For the full year, we now expect this business to be flat.","Turning, now, to gross margin, our adjusted first quarter gross margin was 44.9%, an 80-basis point decrease from a year ago. The Q1 decrease was primarily driven from higher commodities. Now, for the full year, gross margin is expected to be down 80 basis points, and, it's really three primary drivers: incremental commodity headwinds are worth around 40 basis points; incremental transportation costs of around 10 basis points; and, negative brand mix as our household business continues to grow faster than our PC business. The good news is that we are now 85% hedged, so there is not a lot of volatility remaining.","Moving, now, to marketing, marketing as a percent of revenue was 9.9%, which was down 40 basis points year-over-year. If we exclude our recent acquisitions, marketing was actually up 20 basis points to 10.5%. For SG&A, Q1 SG&A increased 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding acquisition amortization, SG&A as a percent of net sales remained essentially flat at 12.8%.","And to operating profit, the adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.9%. Other expense was $19.6 million, which was a $13.7 million change year-over-year, largely due to $21.7 million of interest expense due to our higher debt levels.","Next is income tax. Our effective rate for the quarter was 21.4% on an adjusted basis compared to 30.9% in 2017. We expect the full year rate to be between 24% and 25%.","And now to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. We generated $155 million of net cash for the quarter, $24 million increase from the same quarter a year ago, largely due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital.","So in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 3.8% organic, which translated into our reported EPS growth of 24%.","Turning to the second quarter outlook, we expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.46, a 59% reported increase year-over-year or 12% increase on an adjusted basis. One note on SG&A for Q2, it's going to be a bit higher as we have our acquisition impact, like you saw in Q1, but also investment spending kicking in, Germany and International head count, plus incremental R&D spending.","And now, turning to full year, to summarize our thinking, we now expect organic sales to exceed 3% and reported growth of approximately 9%, which offsets the headwinds we discussed on gross margin. Our full year marketing as a percent of sales slows down a little bit for the company due to improved Waterpik top line performance and our small SPD acquisitions, both of which have low or no marketing associated with them.","We continue to expect EPS to be $2.24 to $2.28 per share, or adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 18%, which is top tier among the entire industry. And finally, turning to cash, we expect Cash from Ops to exceed $680 million.","And with that, we'll turn it back over to you guys, so Matt and I can answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Erica Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. So you talked about your expectations for unfavorable product mix and pricing continuing to improve from here. I'm just curious what is driving that, if you could provide a little more color there?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Erica. It's Rick. I would tell you, for context, if you think back, in 2017 we had some big negative price mix in our Domestic business. Remember, for the full year we were down 320 basis points. In Q4, we were down 130 basis points, and now in Q1 we were down 170 basis points; so, mitigated from 2017. We're always going to have some negative price mix. I think over the last five years, we've averaged around a 120-basis point drag. That's just the nature of our business. But the good news is, as some of the trade optimization, some of the couponing is reduced over the year, that's really what's driving improvement in negative price mix. We also have \u2013 our personal care business this year is doing a little bit better than year ago.","Erica Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's very helpful. And then, just staying along the lines of pricing, are there any signs out there yet of others attempting to take price and are you expecting pricing to be a bigger contributor later in the year?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, this is Matt. As everybody knows, commodities and transportation costs are rising. That's tempering the appetite to compete on price. Of course, to take price, typically you need a strong position in a category and a cost story to the retailer. So an example would be condoms, where we have a 70% share and latex costs would be important to that category.","As Rick said, we think that price mix is going to improve from here out, from Q2, Q3 and Q4, for two reasons. One, is the trade optimization plans and we have less couponing planned for the year. But as you've heard us say more recently at CAGNY and at the Stock Exchange, pricing is difficult to take in this environment. But to the extent that we would be taking price, we wouldn't be telegraphing that on a call.","Erica Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I'll hand it over to someone else.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, Matt, just a quick follow-up there on the pricing discussion. So Clorox sounded pretty good, better than most, I think, this earnings season so far with respect to the ability to take pricing. So understanding this is \u2013 you guys lead in baking soda and contraceptives, but in \u2013 the cat litter business is a big business for you guys, obviously, and they talked about taking pricing there. Is it fair to assume then, I guess, that you guys will follow if they take pricing, number one? Number two, is there any benefit from that in the guidance, just so we're clear?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. This is probably why the general counsel always sits with us when we're on these earnings calls, holding up a big sign saying, no. So Kevin, the reality is, yeah, we're aware of what Clorox said with respect to the litter category. So that, obviously, is just a data point that we would have with respect to what actions we would take, but we wouldn't comment right now what we plan to do or not do. And there's lots of ways to get price. As I mentioned, there's trade optimization. There's also less couponing. There's also pack sizes and how much product you put in the pack. So there's lots of ways to do that without messing with the list pricing, but we wouldn't go any further on that question with respect to the litter category.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And I would just also add to that, right, we had minus 1.7% drag from price mix, but we had strong volume growth, right, in excess of 5%. So that equation works pretty well.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Matt, just to stick with the pricing piece, is it your sense the tenor of these conversations now that retailers are starting to let up because the narrative that's out there is pricing is constrained, and the model is broken for staples companies? Is your sense now that that's misplaced, maybe the market's run too far to one side of the boat and that pricing will be available where you're leading and with innovation?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I would say that, if you talk to our sales guys, they'll say it's no easier to take price now than it has been in the past. You have to be able to take it selectively, so to the extent that you have a really good cost story. But I wouldn't say right now that the dam has broke and now the retailers are open arms with respect to price increases.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And the other good news there is when we do launch new products, they're typically accretive, right. Our SLIDE product for litter is an example of just great innovation and it's accretive to margin. So that's the other end of the spectrum.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. If I could just slip in one more, just on the Waterpik business, which seems like it's on fire, high-single digit growth, and that's all presumably domestic at this point without you guys really leaning in on the international expansion piece. So a couple questions there, Matt. How sustainable is the high-single digit growth domestically? And then, number two, what's sort of the timeline to extend the business, potentially, internationally as well, because it seems like that could be a real contributor to growth looking out to 2019 as this moves into organic? And I can pass it on after that. Thanks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Actually, international business is rocking, Kevin. So we got after that immediately in the second half of 2017. So that's one of the reasons for the high-single digits growth rate. So \u2013 and as far as do we think it's sustainable? I mean, we think it's sustainable at least through 2019. We wouldn't want to go much further out than that.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And just to add to that, by August 1, international Waterpik and consumer \u2013 and Church & Dwight will be fully integrated.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, thank you. Good morning.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I had a question on your organic sales growth. You guys took up your guidance for FY 2018 just slightly, but your Q1 sales came in quite a bit better than you expected. So could you give us a sense as to how much of your improved full year outlook reflects some of the strength in Q1 and whether this means you're likely to see moderating growth, particularly in the back half of the year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, Bonnie, that's a fair question. It's Rick. We did exceed our expectations in Q1. I'd say, on average the \u2013 in Q1 we were 3.8% organic and we said 3% in Q2, so on average it's about 3.5%. And so, that would imply that it's slightly lower than 3% in the second half. But if you look at it on a stacked basis, on a two-year basis, we're around 6% \u2013 solid 6% or so as you go through each of the quarters. So I think part of it is just a comp story, but we think the core business is doing great throughout the year.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That helps. And then, a second question on freight costs, not surprised that they were a headwind for you guys this quarter, but given the magnitude of increase in freight and what we've seen across the sector, could you guys give us a sense as to some of the levers maybe you can potentially pull to reduce any freight costs you might have in the near term, and then even more significantly, over the long term?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, Bonnie, it's Rick, again. I would say, in general, transportation, and you know this very well, across the industry has been a big headwind. For us, it hasn't been as big of a headwind. I think we do have some things to our advantage, like we do have dedicated carriers for a large bulk of our network. We do have multiple sites that produce and ship products, like as an example, laundry detergent's made in three places throughout the country, right, and that helps. We do have some customers that do pick up. So by and large, we have great partners as well. We had some of our key partners in this month and we always try to find a way for us to invest correctly so it's optimized, and our productivity program even goes all the way through our transportation network.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And Bonnie I would add to that, you may remember us talking about this, that we got out ahead of this...","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","... in the second half of 2017 with our partners and, consequently, we probably don't buy as much on the spot market as some of our peers because of the great partners that we have.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Just...","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. I just wanted to touch base on your comment of like \u2013 I think it was eight out of 11 categories had lower promos this quarter versus a year ago, and just trying to understand, is that a trend? Is that more reflective of last year? Was it hyper promotional, especially in detergent? Is that a way we look at it as a way to kind of affect price increase by having lower trade promotions for the rest of the year? Just trying to understand that. And also, I assume that had some benefit to gross margin. Is that sustainable in terms of keeping gross margin from falling too far?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, Bill, if you think about those 14 categories, 9 of them are personal care and personal care is not as heavily promoted as household. So if you thought about where is the \u2013 if you \u2013 so what are the three that are not lower year-over-year? Laundry would be one of them. So the laundry category, it was \u2013 grew by 0.6% in the quarter. We had a great quarter \u2013 ARM & HAMMER grew 9% consumption. And the good news is XTRA was \u2013 grew with the category and had flat share. So the category \u2013 that one was way more promotional year-over-year. So sold on deal in laundry was up 400 basis points. And that was largely driven by Tide and Persil, and they were both up well over 400 basis points sold on deal.","We, on the other hand, were up 200 basis points. So \u2013 and we were essentially on the sidelines in comparison to those guys. But back to the original comment, because we're in personal care and it's less promoted, it's really the household side of the house that you have to watch more carefully.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. So it's not something as we look for the remainder of the year that should be fairly stable? I mean, you don't expect promotion levels to be \u2013 tick back up?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, we think it's going to be fairly stable, Bill. In the example of Q1, the promotional category that was up slightly was laundry and that was already accounted for in our Q1 gross margin and our outlook, but we think, overall, it's a great trend. Most of the businesses in which we compete are not as promotional and we think that's really true for the company from a portfolio perspective versus our peers.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And that's why Rick was saying the average price mix for the last five years is 1.2%. So yeah, and that's generally driven by the household side of the business.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, switching to International, how does that play out this year, which you'd kind of talked about at the Analyst Day was a lot of initiatives, a lot of things that were kicking in, a lot of new product launches? So it would seem that it could accelerate from here. I understand 6.8% is still a great growth number, but is that the fair way to look at it? There is still more to come?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","So Bill, you're not disappointed with 6.8%, are you?","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I didn't say that. I just said it's a nice number.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, look, we got a 6% algorithm and we just think it's sustainable. Think of all the things we've done. We've expanded by establishing an office in Panama and Singapore. That's certainly benefiting our export business. We opened a new subsidiary in Germany, which is \u2013 we hadn't been there previously. And now, we just got way more focus, got great people in there and we think we're going to hit 6% or better for the year.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just want to talk a little more about international, again. First is just price mix was really strong in the quarter, so any color you could add there, if it's geographic mix, pricing. What was sort of driving that? And then, also, I think, if I recall correctly, Mexico is a good-sized business for you and we've heard kind of mixed reports from other companies about sort of the Mexican consumer resilience in a slower economy. So anything you could offer to some of the Mexico portion of that business would be great?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'll start with Mexico. So Mexico has been just a fabulous business for us for the last few years and they've been growing double-digit. And I think that's as a result of a lot of the focus that we have down there. And we have both household products and personal care products and I think it's a question of execution, Lauren, for us in Mexico. And so, we have \u2013 again, expect double-digit growth for Mexico this year. So it's been a great story for us.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And as for the positive price mix for International business, you're right, it is a little bit outsized. There's three things. One is Mexico had some good price increases that are flowing through. Number two is that the PC brand mix is also very strong for that business. And then, number three, as we go direct to Germany and take the distributor margin, in effect, that's a good guy from a price mix perspective.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So we can look at price mix being a pretty healthy contributor to that business for the balance of the year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, just final thing is I wanted to confirm that tax rate for the full year guidance is unchanged?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Correct, 24% to 25%.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So I just want to follow up on Lauren's question and ask it maybe a different way, sort of glass half empty. If you look at International, that's always been volume driven. This quarter was sort of price mix driven with a bit of a slowdown in volumes. Was that because of the price increases in Mexico, at least in part?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think price \u2013 I don't want to repeat what Rick said, but yeah, that was definitely an element in the first quarter.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. But going forward, I mean, how do you see the composition of that growth? Is it still going to be more volume driven?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Over the long-term, of course. Just like our core consumer business, it's largely volume driven. I think this year there is a piece of it, because when we go direct, we take out the distributor margin, like I mentioned. And International business does \u2013 is able to take price globally pretty well, too. But in general, it's volume driven business with a little bit of price.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, just on gross margin, Rick, I just want to clarify something you said earlier. You said transportation and commodities were an additional 50 basis points, right, because I think in February you told us that that would be a headwind of 50 basis points to 70 basis points?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, that's right. I think there is a \u2013 yes, it's an incremental hit. So now, today, I would say the full year drag from commodities is around 80 basis points. The drag from distribution is around 20 basis point, so 100 basis points all in from those two things.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And one of the planned offsets was the mix between personal care and household, and it sounds like that's not happening, at least the way you guys expect. So I'm curious, what was going on there?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think it's more net good news than anything. Our personal care business, this is the second quarter in a row that we have growth. So that's a great thing organically; it's kind of turned around from 2017. It's just our household business is growing even faster than we expected. And so, that's part of the reason we raised the reported outlook and the organic outlook.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, Matt, Rick. Good morning. So I'd like to, please, zoom in in the laundry business. So I appreciate the comments before. But as we saw in the tracked channels, it seems like there's \u2013 you picked up share from a competitor, who had some supply chain transitions during the quarter, and \u2013 at least, if we look in the Wall Street version of Nielsen. So we see them gaining share, but you said flat. So part of the question is, is it true that you gained share in the tracked channels, but not broadly? So, does that imply that the top two competitors are gaining share online? So \u2013 and then, how are you thinking about the competitive environment in laundry? And you said \u2013 I mean, just trying to mosaic what you said in terms of the fact that you had some pick-up in items sold on promo during the quarter. So how are you seeing and how is your embedding \u2013 are you embedding on the guidance in terms of the competitive environment, and specifically now? Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, I just want to be clear that we had a smoking quarter in laundry; smoking. I mean, the category grew 60 bps and ARM & HAMMER laundry grew 8.9%. OxiClean liquid laundry detergent consumption grew 30%, and Xtra, for the first time, held share in quite a while. So all three brands showed up in Q1. So \u2013 no, we had a fabulous quarter from a share perspective and we didn't spend to get it, unlike our competitors. Like I said before, the sold on deal was far more promotional this year than last year first quarter, up 400 basis points, and that's all Henkel and P&G. So, we were...","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, so \u2013 sorry to interrupt. I was just trying to clarify because I thought you said something about shares were flat. So I was actually surprised because we saw shares going up. So you're saying shares were broadly up, right, for the laundry...","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","For Church & Dwight?","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, yeah. That's right in the Nielsen's, yeah.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","That's what we're quoting.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then \u2013 and so, you expect that to continue or are you thinking, obviously, Henkel had some issues with logistics, and then that also could have been a tailwind for you? Is that something that you think is consistent or you're seeing them, again, trying to defend, because I'm sure they will try to defend the share that they lost?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, I think one thing to keep in mind is this is the 33rd consecutive quarter in a row that we've grown share in ARM & HAMMER. And we think we've stabilized Xtra, and OxiClean has been growing. So I like our chances going forward. This isn't just an anomaly in Q1. We've been growing ARM & HAMMER quarterly for eight years.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair. Thank you so much, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. So, just to go back to the Waterpik growth, because it was a standout. The high-single digit growth that you're expecting \u2013 I just want to frame that in the context that the timeline for consumers to replenish on that product is longer than in most of your portfolio. So can you just share any data around whether you're seeing those early wins converting into sustainable consumer retention or whether there is any risk that, initially, your distribution wins and trial might fall off over time? Just how you're thinking about that?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","What we see, frankly, is that gum health is starting to matter to consumers. So \u2013 and you are correct in that it's a longer purchase cycle, but we bought Waterpik because they had good growth for each of the last three years. So, you have repeat purchases and you have households that have one, two, three or four Waterpiks \u2013 flossers. So, you are correct in that it's a long purchase cycle, but the company has been enjoying the interest in gum health. So if you look at toothpaste, for example, you saw that GSK launched parodontax. And then, there's been one or two other entrants into toothpaste that are directed towards gum health.","So it would seem that in oral care that gum health, where once upon a time I think people might have frowned upon whether or not using flossers was beneficial, I think that's changing. The Waterpik business has done a fabulous job in reaching the dental community through a hygienist program and we expect to replicate that internationally. And, early days, we think that international is going to be a goldmine for us in that business.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And I think, just to say one other thing, Steve, is to be able to call the full year up high single digits in late April, early May just shows you the confidence we have in that business.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, for sure. No, thank you. Matt, were you foreshadowing a new gum health ARM & HAMMER toothpaste launch?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, I was not. I was not telegraphing that, Steve, but it's a wonderful idea.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, I know it's a reasonable distance in the future, but we saw Lou Tursi's intention \u2013 his announcement to retire early next year. So can you just talk us through the plans and processes that you're going through for succession, because obviously, he's been a pretty integral part of the Church & Dwight story. So just love your thoughts there. Thanks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. So yeah, Lou's going to be leaving us at the end of the year. Huge shoes to fill. The process is that we'll do an external search. Lou is on the interview team. So the next leader will have his full endorsement or Lou will be continuing to work in 2019 and 2020. And so, we'll plan on hiring that person pretty early, so that we'll have plenty of overlap this year.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Maybe we can get Lou back at the Stock Exchange next year for a proper sendoff. Thanks a lot.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Great idea.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. My question is around pricing. Obviously, I understand you don't want to preview any pricing plans, particularly if you're potentially in active discussions with retailers right now. But conceptually, if commodities and transportation costs are going up and you feel \u2013 sounds like you feel really good about your shares and competitors are pricing, why would you choose not to follow?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. We never said that, Olivia.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, I know. I know. I'm just trying to understand.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Again, we don't really like to get into the pricing telegraph discussions. I think in general, the comments from me on the call were, over time with higher commodity costs, higher transportation costs, if we would lead in certain categories, we would follow in others. There's more than one way to take a price increase besides list price increases. We talked about trade optimization, couponing, pack sizes, all that other stuff. So that's the extent on which we're going to make any comments on pricing.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then, your organic sales growth, obviously better than many in CPG, so I'd love to get your perspective from you on the U.S. retail environment and the state of the consumer. I mean, obviously, you probably got a little bit of help from Henkel's challenges this quarter, but are you seeing incremental shelf space, new distribution, better online pick-up? Just what are the key drivers of the growth?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, we would say that the consumer is strong. In the economy, I think one of the things you always have to keep an eye on is gas prices. It's clear that the tax reform has put more money in the pockets of consumers. So we would say that the consumer is strong. So it's a good environment right now.","As far as, are there going to be winners and losers out there? Absolutely. But we \u2013 the way we look at it is we have 11 brands that consumers love. We support them. We're improving our ability to target and connect with consumers and our online sales continues to grow. So we're well positioned to be a winner.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.","David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. This is David Mandel in for John. Thank you for taking my questions. I would like to start off by just asking about Henkel's 2016 expansion into the laundry category. At the time, it seemed to be a game changer and it really hasn't been. And I think that's proven out to be \u2013 is it better data that you guys have? Are you guys targeting or is it something else? Why are you guys performing so well?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","I think the short answer is that ARM & HAMMER is the strongest brand in value laundry detergent.","David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Well, that's easy enough.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah.","David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","And if I had to ask, would you be able to dimensionalize how much higher gross margins are in pods versus liquid, say within a brand family like OxiClean?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. We don't \u2013 we just don't go into the level of detail, David.","David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. And finally, hopefully, I can go two for three, instead of one for three. If \u2013 could you speak to the \u2013 to what's going on in the channels that are better for you than the channels that are worse for you in terms of drug and grocery shift to mass? Is that still a headwind? Is that still a risk?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","So phrase that again. The shift to...?","David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","The shift out of drug and the shift out of grocery into mass. I believe in the 10-K that's called out as a risk in terms of net sales.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, it's been a trend for quite some time. I think the bigger trend these days is really the online shift. But I think we're well positioned in both classes of trade.","David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","So, you're not seeing anything pick up. It's pretty much status quo?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. The way to think about is we have to go where the consumer is, right.","David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Right.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","So you're right, over time you have shifts from one class of trade to another. Some would say that the dollar class of trade has been strengthening over time and continues to strengthen. That may be just a reflection of the consumer's interest in value and value brands. But I would say we look at that in totality and we want to win in every one of our classes of trade.","David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","That's great. Thank you so much for the color and I'll pass it along.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning guys.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Just had a question on the vitamin business. You've owned Avid for about five years now, and I think at the time you acquired it it was around a $250 million business with $70 million, $75 million of EBITDA. Can you talk about the kind of growth you've experienced, has it kind of met your expectations, and as you look forward, the opportunities from here that you see to grow the business, whether it's predominantly in the adult segment, children's segment, a combination of both? And I'll throw a third one in there. I think at the time you talked about the gummy biz was potentially a mechanism for delivering other kind of benefits, medications, other wellness benefits. Is that still something that you think you can do over time in that business? Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. You're right. So the business, when we bought it, was approximately that size. It did grow rapidly, initially, at first. Certainly, the first year that we owned it attracted a lot more entrants into the category, so our growth rate slowed. And you may recall, a couple of years ago we had difficulty in bringing the new plant online, so we went sideways in growth for at least a year. But we think we've got that turned around right now. So we had some growth last year for the first quarter; vitafusion, the adult gummy, grew over 6% consumption, L'IL CRITTERS grew 2% consumption. So that bodes well for us. Our focus is on adult. That's the big market. We think that the kids gummy vitamins is somewhat saturated, but the big opportunity is in adult.","And with respect to medications, you're right. The thinking is, is there a way to take active RX products and put them in gummy form? The difficulty is in masking the taste of the active, so that you still have a great taste in gummy. So that is not something that we've been able to solve to-date, but that would certainly be something that, if we could sort it out, would be another avenue of growth for us.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Matt Farrell for any further remarks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, guys. We'll let you go. We had a fabulous quarter.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","James R. Craigie","Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our second quarter business results, which you've read about in our press release morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and to discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you.","Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the second quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued weak U.S. consumer demand and a highly competitive environment, the Church & Dwight team delivered solid business results in line with our 2014 plan. As you know, our 2014 plan is driven by our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products, aggressive productivity programs and best-in-class management of overhead costs and cash flow.","As you've heard from many of our CPG competitors, consumer demand is very weak. We are facing the same tough business environment, as consumption was flat or down in 8 of our 13 categories. While we have taken actions to remain price competitive, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in the long term. Despite the tough business environment, our goal in 2014 is to not only deliver our aggressive business targets, but to drive share growth across all of our major categories via innovative new products.","Innovation has been the key to our past success, as shown by the fact that over 32% of our sales in 2013 came from new products launched since 2007. As promised, we launched a record number of innovative new products in 2014 across every one of our major categories and 3 new categories. This represents the first time in our company's history that we launched a great new product in every one of our major categories in the same year and the first time that we launched into more than one new category in 1 year.","In the first quarter of 2014, our sales force did an incredible job in gaining incremental distribution from retailers in every category. Gaining incremental distribution is the first key step to driving future sales and profit growth. So we got off to a great start.","In the second quarter, our goal was to initiate strong consumer demand for the new products via increased marketing support. We also met this goal, as we achieved record quarterly share results on 3 of our 4 mega brands and share gains on 3 of our 5 other major brands. These 9 brands represent over 80% of our sales and profit. While there's still a half-year to go, we are right on track to deliver our aggressive EPS target of 7% to 9% growth despite the difficult headwinds, which are driving many of our competitors to forecast lower earnings growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt, to give you some specific details on our second quarter business results.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everybody. Second quarter EPS was $0.65 per share. That compares with $0.61 in 2013, so up 7% from 1 year ago. And of course, the $0.65 was better than our $0.61 outlook. With respect to FX, netted in our $0.65 is a $0.01 drag from FX year-over-year.","Reported revenues were up 2.6% to $808 million. Organic sales of 3% was in line with our Q2 outlook of 3% organic sales. Of the 3% organic growth, approximately 3.6% was due to volume with 60 basis points of negative product mix and pricing. Price mix was less of a story in Q2 versus Q1. Remember in Q1, we had a high level of sliding to drive distribution of our new products, and that was less so in the second quarter.","Now let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic's business' organic sales increased by 0.7%, primarily due to sales of our recently introduced ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL Cat Litter, OxiClean Liquid Laundry Detergent and higher sales of ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent and Vitafusion vitamins. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of XTRA laundry detergent and lower sales of ARM & HAMMER unit dose laundry detergent. The volume growth contributed approximately 1.5% to organic sales, offset by 80 basis points negative affect of product mix and price. The volume growth deceleration in Q2 was, in large part, due to slower share growth of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry, which was 0.2% in the quarter, and share declines on the XTRA brand.","So the consumer business wasn't as strong as we expected in the quarter. However, the actions we took starting in June resulted in a strong end to the quarter and an even better July. So for example, for the 4 weeks ended July 19, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry share is up 0.8 points year-over-year. And we expect the consumer business to be stronger in Q3 than in Q2 as our actions drive stronger volumes.","International business is next. The organic growth was up 3.9%. Volume increased approximately 4.7%, offset by 80 basis points of unfavorable product mix and pricing. We had strong growth across all the countries within that division.","For our Specialty Products division, organic sales increased by 22.9%. The animal nutrition business drove a 20.9% volume increase, with favorable mix and pricing contributing another 2%. Remember that last year, Q2 2013 was a very difficult quarter for this business. And currently, the U.S. dairy industry is extremely healthy, experiencing record high milk prices and low input costs, which are driving demand for our product. So we expect, on a full year basis, total company organic sales to be approximately 3%.","I'm now going to discuss gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 44.6%, a 50 basis points contraction year-over-year, but better than the 100 basis points contraction we expected. The decrease in gross margin year-over-year is primarily due to increased coupon redemptions, trade spending and higher commodity costs, offset by positive product and business mix, and of course, our productivity programs.","For the full year, we now expect gross margin to contract 75 basis points, which is at the high end of our previous 50 to 75 basis points range that we discussed in May. And this is largely due to the price competition in the laundry category.","Regarding commodities, our year-over-year input costs have trended up in Q2, in particular due to resin, which is at a 3-year high.","Next is marketing. The marketing spend for the second quarter was $113.4 million or 14% of revenues, which is an 80 basis point increase over the prior year spend and $10 million higher on a dollar spend. If you are a historian, it's been 5 years since marketing, as a percentage of sales, has hit 14% or higher in the second quarter. And our marketing spend, of course, was timed to support new products, and we reached record shares on 3 of our 4 mega brands in the quarter.","We expected our marketing spend to be front end loaded this year to support all the great new products during launch. The second half is expected to be lower versus 1 year ago. But of course, you've always heard us talk about share of voice versus share of market.","Now looking at that ratio, we're very satisfied. Also, a flat marketing spend for the year is relatively stronger than quite a bit of our peers, who are cutting marketing to fund trade program -- programs. And this is also evident in some of the news you've probably been watching, with respect to the upfront buys, which has been weaker this year.","SG&A is next. SG&A year-over-year was lower by $2 million in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 13%, a 60 basis point decrease from the prior year second quarter. So, so far, in the first half, we've averaged 110 basis points decrease versus the prior year, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half and for the year.","Next is operating profit. Reported operating margin for the quarter was 17.1%, which was a 70 basis point contraction versus year ago. But keep in mind, this is largely due to the 80 basis point increase in marketing year-over-year.","With respect to income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 34.2%, slightly less than last year, which was 34.5%. And we expect the full year rate to be 34%.","With respect to cash flow, we generated $207 million of net cash from operations for the first half of 2014 and we invested $17 million year-to-date in CapEx. So we now expect to spend approximately $70 million on CapEx for full year 2014. Cash from operations full year is expected to exceed $525 million and free cash flow to exceed $455 million.","Regarding stock buybacks. The company has purchased $435 million of shares through ASRs year-to-date, $260 million in Q1 and $175 million in Q2. You may recall that during our May call, I said that we would likely spend more and about half of the remaining authorization. And that's what we did. We have approximately $140 million remaining under our authorization, and we do not anticipate making additional share repurchases in 2014.","So I'm going to wrap it up now. So looking ahead, we feel good about the second half. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.80 to $0.82 compared to $0.76 per share last year. And as we mentioned in the release, we expect 3% organic sales growth in Q3 and gross margin to contract by 150 basis points.","We began 2014 expecting a back-end loaded year. Q1 EPS was down 4%, as it was a big investment quarter behind new products. Q2 that we just ended, up 7% EPS despite a significant increase in marketing. And in Q3, using the midpoint of our $0.80 to $0.82 range that I just mentioned is also up 7%. So that implies Q4 would deliver $0.19 of earnings improvement year-over-year, if you want it to reach the midpoint of our 7% to 9% range. So almost half of the Q4 earnings improvement will come from 3 things: an impairment charge that you read about in last year's 10-K, that we don't expect to repeat; we have some litigation costs in the prior year quarter that we also don't expect to repeat; and of course, lower shares.","The balance of the year-over-year EPS increase in Q4, about 10% growth, comes from the base business and greater traction from new products that we launched earlier in the year.","So to summarize the full year, for those of you who are working on your models, we're expecting 3% organic sales; gross margin contraction of 75 basis points, obviously influenced by slotting and couponing, behind the new products; and if you work your way down the P&L, we expect marketing as a percentage of sales to be flat year-over-year, to be around 12.5%, and now expect SG&A to be down 125 basis points. And all that would get us to the midpoint of the 7% to 9% EPS range, and the 50 basis points expansion of operating margin.","Back to you, Jim.","James R. Craigie","Thanks, Matt. I'll finish off our portion of the call today by adding a little color to the second quarter results that Matt just took you through, and then provide my outlook on the year.","As I mentioned earlier, our new product innovations played a key role in driving share gains in the second quarter across 6 of our 9 biggest brands, including share gains on 3 of our 4 mega brands. Among those 9 brands, our biggest focus was on turning the OxiClean brand into a mega brand in 2014, by extending it into 3 new categories: premium laundry detergent; bleach alternatives and automatic dishwashing detergents.","Overall, this strategy is off to a great start, as assumption of the total OxiClean brand in the second quarter was up 35% versus year ago. This included strong results on every form of the brand. The core OxiClean laundry additive product achieved a record quarterly share of 45.5%, which is bigger than the next 4 competitors combined. The new OxiClean premium laundry detergent achieved a 1.0 dollar share in the liquid laundry detergent category, after just 4 months in distribution.","A 1.0 dollar share may not seem much to you, but keep in mind that the liquid laundry detergent category is a $6 billion category, and P&G's famous Cheer brand is only a 1.0 share after 768 months in market.","And most importantly, our consumer research reveals that the sale of our new OxiClean premium liquid laundry detergent brand is over 80% incremental to our other liquid laundry detergents. Our new OxiClean auto dish detergent achieved a 1.6% dollar share in the second quarter, is on track to become the #3 player in this category by year end. And our new OxiClean bleach alternative, called White Revive, achieved a 2.2% dollar share in the second quarter. Distribution of this product was almost entirely incremental, as we were able to get it placed in the bleach section versus the laundry detergent section, where the core OxiClean laundry additive product is located. As a result, sales of this product are over 70% incremental to the core OxiClean laundry additive franchise.","The strong sales incrementality of these new products is critical to achieving sales growth. Our other mega brands also achieved strong results in the second quarter. Our newest mega brand, the Avid gummy vitamin business, delivered double-digit consumption growth in the second quarter, behind expanded distribution, new products and increased marketing support. This double-digit growth occurred just by flat category growth, as a result of unfavorable publicity last year about the benefits of taking multivitamins.","The category trends are now headed in the positive direction and most importantly, the fast-growing gummy form of vitamins now represents 7% of the total vitamin category. That's more than twice what it was when we bought the business in 2012. This still leaves over 93% of the $7 billion vitamin category to be conquered by encouraging consumers to switch from the swallowing tasteless hard pills to enjoying our delicious tasting gummy vitamins. We have the #1 gummy brand for both kids and adults, and Church & Dwight was 1 of only 2 vitamin brands to grow share in the second quarter. These strong results to date put us on track to deliver our double-digit sales growth outlook of the year, despite lower-than-expected category growth and increased gummy competition.","On our TROJAN mega brand, we achieved a record quarterly share in the sexual health category, driven by record quarterly sales of condoms and continued growth of our new lubricant line that was launched in 2013. On the largest part of our sexual health business, our TROJAN condom business, we matched its highest ever quarterly market share at 76.0%. And this momentum has continued in the third quarter, as I just learned yesterday that the TROJAN condom business achieved an all-time record monthly share of 76.8% in the month of July.","Our biggest mega brand, ARM & HAMMER, held its share in the second quarter, despite some fierce price competition. In the laundry category, the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent brand grew its share. This share growth represented the 18th consecutive quarter that the ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent brand has posted year-on-year share growth. It strengthened the brand's #1 position in the value segment and it enabled the ARM & HAMMER brand to pass the ALL brand to become the #3 brand in the total liquid laundry detergent category.","While these are very positive results to the ARM & HAMMER brand, the real star of the ARM & HAMMER mega brand portfolio was our cat litter business. Our premium price cat litter, called ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal, has been a huge hit with the consumers, as reflected in both our brand share results and its positive impact on category growth. Our second quarter consumption for our ARM & HAMMER cat litter business increased by over 20%, and our share grew 2.8 points to a record quarterly share of 23.3%.","These great share results strengthen our position as the number 2 brand in the category. Just as important, our new Clump & Seal product has been a major contributor to driving cat litter category sales growth of over 7% in the second quarter, the strongest growth in any of our 13 categories and excellent growth for any CPG category. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key anecdote driving improved value creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders.","Unfortunately, some of our competitors have not invested in developing new products and instead, have increased their trade and coupon spending to defend their brands. This happened particularly in the laundry detergent category. In case you do not know, Church & Dwight is the only competitor to grow share in the laundry detergent category every year for the past 5 years. We are now the #2 player in this category, and 1 out of every 4 wash loads is done with a Church & Dwight laundry detergent.","The growth of our laundry detergent business has been driven by our value pricing, great new products, increased distribution and higher marketing spending. As I stated earlier, our largest laundry detergent brand, ARM & HAMMER, has posted year-on-year share growth for 18 consecutive quarters, including share growth in the first and second quarters of 2014.","Our OxiClean laundry additives brand has posted year-on-year share growth for 11 consecutive quarters and achieved a record quarterly share of 45.5% in the second quarter. In 2014, we launched innovative new products on our ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent brand. And to continue our remarkable record of share growth, we extended the OxiClean brand into the laundry detergent category, with solid initial results, as I mentioned earlier.","Unfortunately, several competitors who have not invested in innovative new products began lowering their prices starting the third quarter of 2013. We held off from responding in the back half of 2013 because our laundry brands continue to deliver sales and share growth driven by our product innovations.","In the first quarter of 2014, the competitors added unprecedented levels of coupon support on top of the lower price points. Again, we held our ground, in the hopes that our new product innovations, which are being launched at the end of the first quarter, would offset these pricing actions. The competitors kept up their higher trade spending and coupon support in the second quarter, and it began to clearly impact the sales of our laundry brands despite the launch of our new products.","So starting in the month of June, we took actions designed to restore our price competitiveness and drive increased trial behind our great new laundry detergent products. I will not divulge or answer any questions concerning the specifics of what we have done, for competitive reasons. I will just tell you that these actions drove a significant improvement in our sales and our share results starting in June and we've seen continued sales and share momentum in July. In fact, our laundry detergent business achieved a record high share in the month of July.","So I'm confident that our actions should enable us to deliver the laundry and business results that we need to deliver our 2014 annual sales and EPS commitments.","I'll finish off our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the year. As I stated in the press release, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance of organic sales growth of approximately 3% and earnings growth target of 7% to 9%. This will be driven by our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products across every one of our major categories and 3 new categories, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead costs.","Our 7% to 9% earnings growth target is in the upper quartile of EPS growth target ranges in the CPG industry, consistent with our historical performance. And we believe that we can deliver that within that aggressive range despite the highly environment and weak U.S. consumer demand.","The majority of our annual earnings growth is planned to occur in the second half, since the first half includes a significant increase in slotting, couponing, trade promotions and incremental advertising support for our new product launches versus what we spent last year.","In conclusion, 2014 is shaping up to be another very challenging year. But when things get tough, you should place your bets on the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver consistently strong EPS growth.","Last, but not least, I want to assure that we are pursuing acquisitions, and we have over $2 billion of financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions, because we are very selective about the types of businesses we acquire. At the same time, we're also responsible to our shareholders so we will continue to be patient until we find the right deal that will pay dividend for many years to come.","That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First on the SG&A efficiency. It's certainly driving a fair amount of growth this year. The question is sustainability of that. How much of the SG&A cuts are sort of transitory, whether they be incentive compensation, et cetera, that may need to be reloaded next year versus how much of it is enduring?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, Jason, it's too early to comment on incentive compensation, as far as saying how much of a benefit there may or may not be year-over-year. It's a whole function of our 4 metrics for the full year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you comment on how much of this maybe enduring?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Are you saying that next year, if we have a blowout year, will incentive comp be higher? Yes, it will be.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, not incentive comp, just the rest of SG&A. I mean, you're -- it's tracking down year-on-year. Should we expect -- if we were to forget about incentive compensation just the underlying components, does it bounce is back? I know you mentioned, the first quarter, you are lapping some acquisition-related expenditures, which presumably they've gone away unless there's another deal, they're not going to come back...","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Right, exactly. That's right, yes. On the first quarter, SG&A was down 160 basis points, 40 basis points came from the fact that we didn't have the average transition costs year-over-year, right? So they're not going to be reloaded next year.","James R. Craigie","But Jason, we've done a lot in terms of IT systems to be able to keep overhead down. And we look at some organizational design things. So I would tell you the vast majority of SG&A savings is enduring.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, Jason, what -- the way the model works for us is that SG&A needs to grow at a much slower rate than our top line growth rate. That way, we're going to get leverage on that line. And that, combined with acquisitions, has enabled us to drive that number down 300 basis points over a number of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, can you guys just maybe expand a little bit further on what you saw in laundry during the course of Q2 and how it differed from your expectations coming in to the quarter? And then as you look forward over the course of Q3 and Q4, I guess, a little more details on what you expect to -- what kinds of sensitivities you had around competitive dynamics, retail responses over the balance -- on the balance of the year in that specific category?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Steve, I mean, I can't speak for competition. I can just tell you about what happened is, as I said, we didn't start it. We don't like it. We prefer to grow through innovation. We've taken appropriate actions to deal with it. And I'm confident we'll deliver our 2014 EPS commitments despite it and exit the year with momentum.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. On -- as you -- I guess, as you think about -- this is shifting gears kind of entirely, but if you think about your M&A activity, can you talk about where you're just seeing the most flow of potential deals, setting aside the quality of those opportunities? I guess, are there certain categories where there's more flow, whether personal care, household or consumer health? Are the opportunities skewed to smaller standalone companies or...","James R. Craigie","Steve, let me save you a minute, the answer is no.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You're not going to do it? Okay, fine. And then I guess, lastly, on mega brand growth, looking into the out years. From here, how much do you expect, roughly, growth to be driven by your base products -- base category presences today versus further horizontal expansion and into new adjacencies? Just kind of give us a rough feel of the balance that you have as a base case?","James R. Craigie","Yes, it's a great question, Steve. Honestly, we don't have a spine of measure on that because we launch new products in the base, as well as launching into the new categories. The real key there is the efficiency of marketing spending. We just saw in OxiClean this year because we launched into 3 new categories, plus we had innovation on the base. The whole businesses is up 35%, if you count all the sales against it. And it's just an efficient way to go-to-market because if we spend money on OxiClean laundry detergent or OxiClean dishwashing, it halos to the whole business. So at this point in time, I can't honestly give you an answer to the fact that the difference between the new categories versus the base because it really depends on what we do in each of those categories going forward in that. But it's just -- the core is that we -- the 4 mega brands we have right now are about 60% of our revenues. And we're spending about 75% of our marketing money against those 4 because you get the biggest bang for the buck. So you're going to see that overall, the 4 mega brands are going to be the biggest drivers of our future growth. I just can't tell you within the categories they cover what that will be.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Is it just fair to say though that your R&D focus is spread -- is balanced between extension of the core versus exploration of new categories?","James R. Craigie","Absolutely. Because the core -- still, the vast majority of those business is still the core.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to get your thoughts -- I mean, you've been kind of ahead of the curve and very accurate on your assessment of just generally what's been going on in the U.S. economy. And it just seems like the second quarter things really took a turn for the worse. And I'm just wondering your thoughts, are you seeing something in terms of trips, because all center store items are really starting to suffer. So I'm wondering if this reduced trip levels are impacting consumption? Just any perspective you might have on what could explain the step down from where we were even 3 and 6 months ago?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Nik. I wish I knew more. I mean, all I can tell you top line, as I said, 8 of our 13 categories were flat or down in the second quarter. That's all -- it's honestly only a little worse than it's been in prior years. It's not like a major falling off the cliff. I don't have anything specific, I have no personal thoughts. It's just the people just have less disposable income out there and they're having to make hard choices and having to stretch their product uses over time in that. And I just don't -- I don't see any improvement -- we're not counting on any improvement going forward. That's why it's very important to us to put out products that offer a great product, but also great value. And that's what we're particularly known at -- known for. But I wish things are going to get better. I don't believe the headlines in USA Today talking about things looking brighter out there. We're going to continue to operate on. We're plan for the worst and hope for the best.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then the -- last question, is just on the July figures that you provided in the laundry category. Have you seen any response from the competition in that regard? I mean, should we just expect them to kind of stay where they are? Or have you seen some response?","James R. Craigie","Well, I will say Procter has stepped up the game out there, in terms of trading coupon support. I mean, just walk into a Walmart and look at their displays on that. So Procter has absolutely stepped up support. Good news is the category actually showed some improvement because I think between us and Procter, stepping up support, people are trading back up to the better brands, and it'd be a better ring in the store. So despite the increased intensity out there, particularly from us and Procter, categories starting to move in a positive direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Matt, I want -- I thought your commentary that you don't plan on buying back any further shares for the balance of the year was curious, given your cash position. Can you reconcile that a bit for us, particularly given the pullback in the stock and near-term M&A intentions?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, I wouldn't comment on what our prospects are or events that might take place in M&A in the short term. Now we've -- this company has always been thoughtful about how it deploys its cash. So we don't necessarily go and take every dime and plow it into share purchases in order to get an EPS benefit. Many have been in the camp of saying that the company is underlevered. And that is a great ability to buy back shares to reduce -- or to increase EPS. But of course, we think the highest and best use of the balance sheet is acquisition. So this is something we visit every quarter as management and as a board and concluded that where we are, we're pretty happy with what we've done year-to-date. Obviously, it supports our ability to hit our 7% to 9% EPS growth number. So consequently, we're done for the year.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Jim, can you, I guess, give us a little bit more detail -- this is with respect to unit dose, and specifically what impediments you guys are facing there? Because we're what, low double-digits, I think, is a percent of the category now for unit dose as a percent of laundry, and likely moving higher. And you guys really aren't participating in a meaningful way. So what are the impediments that you guys are facing? And do you plan on participating in a more meaningful way?","James R. Craigie","Well, Kevin, I mean, unit dose is a great product, great innovation. Kudos to Procter that innovation is driving the category. We have participated. We had a product out there before Procter got out there. They've obviously been putting a lot of their marketing support behind it. We decided to focus more in the liquid business, which is over 70% of the category. So we're out there. We've got a great product out there. We have more innovations coming along that product line. So the -- it's now about 11% to 12% of the total laundry business. So like, again, we look at priorities and we put more of our energy behind the liquid side of the business, 70%, and we put a lot of energy behind launching OxiClean liquid laundry detergent. We also launched that, by the way, in a pod form. But the liquids remains the key focus right now. But I totally applaud Procter on the unit dose product. Great new product. They're there. They have gotten higher than their fair share because they put the majority of their support behind it. But we're going to -- we're there and we're going to be there, and we hope to grow that business in the future.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just one more for me, if I may. Jim, this is for you. Just with respect to the 3% to 4%, and this is long-term algorithm, and I'm not asking you guys to guide for next year. But it seems -- last year, you fell a little bit short. This year, you'll be stretching probably to get to the lower end and you have specialty and cat litter and a big contribution from Avid, which are driving most of it. In the absence of buying an asset that's accretive to your growth, does the long-term algorithm feel like it's more of a stretch in this environment?","James R. Craigie","No, not at all. I mean, honestly I always want you guys -- well, think -- 2014 is really a year of investing for the future for us. But still, unlike other companies, they'd say invest, and they pull down their EPS. We're going to invest and still deliver a top quartile EPS growth. Don't forget we put a lot of energy and a lot of cost into launching the record number of new products this year across all of our 9 brands. We've spent the marketing support behind it. So we expect that to pay off in the future. There's a lot investment there. And then, we have the pricing situation breakout in the laundry category. That has partly dented at this year. I can't project what the future of that will be, but I don't believe that's going to continue forever. So I definitely feel the investment we made in new products this year -- the marketing -- we held our marketing. Other guys are cutting their marketing. That's going to pay off. And so at the end of the day, you guys always pay us to find the levers to drive the bottom line earnings growth. We have the revenue levers one, we got gross margin, we got marketing, we got SG&A, we got cash flow, we got acquisitions. And you pay us to figure out what combination of those delivers in our top quartile growth. And we've always found a way to do that. We've quadrupled our share over the 10 years. Nobody gave us a pass last year, when our Specialty Products division tanked, but we covered that and still delivered double the EPS growth. And this year, we're having a little bit of problem with the domestic side, with the pricing of laundry. But we're taking care of that and going forward. So just trust us, that we'll always going to find a way to deliver top quartile EPS growth. We've done it in the past. We're going to do it in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen from William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to ask about your newest mega brand, Avid. You mentioned, Jim, double-digit consumption growth and a flat category. Can you talk a little bit more about what's driving that? And where you stand in terms of distribution expansion on the base business? And then kind of where you are in terms of ACV and the new enhanced offerings? And then you also said that you have seen some improvement in the underlying category. What are you seeing there? And what's driving that?","James R. Craigie","Yes. I think -- it was late last year, a report came out that kind of dinged the benefits from taking multivitamins. And it actually drove a category that have consistently grown high-single-digits or low-double-digits, set it back and it actually declined for a quarter or 2. Now it's coming back. Second quarter was flat. We expect the category to start growing again in the third and fourth quarter. So we heard this -- we talked to many people in the vitamin business where we bought this business. And they expect -- they said to expect these things to happen as reports come out, as they do in many, many food categories in there. So that was unfortunate, but it wasn't a surprise and it doesn't worry us at that all. And like I said, it's gone from being negative in the first quarter to neutral in the second quarter, and we see every sign it will go positive in third and fourth quarters. Distribution, we've gained a lot since we bought this business because, quite honestly, we have a much bigger sales force than the prior owner did. And our sales is doing a job in getting distribution of the current products out there. We still have room to grow on that in, and we're still cracking distribution voids every day. And I don't have an exact number on the ACV, but it's -- we're -- we still have many opportunities. Just clarify too, the real growth opportunity is in adult vitamins. We bought a business that already -- in the kids side of the business, over 50% of the category was already gummies. So we love to grow that even more, but it was already high. When we bought the business, the adult side was only about 3% of the total adult business. Now the great news is the adult business is about $6.5 billion category, versus kids, it's like $300 million. So that's actually great. So with $6.5 billion, only 3% is adult gummies. That's already more than double that. But still, over 90% of the adult vitamins to capture as we trade people up. And I have yet to find 1 person, 1 adult who I've got to try the gummy vitamins who isn't blown away by how great it tastes and wants to convert right away. And we're just doing a great job of launching all sorts of new vitamins, and there's lots of opportunities for new types of vitamins going forward that our team is working hard on. So if I sound excited about this business, I am. This is one that's going to be -- it's going to -- it's already a great acquisition for us, and it's got such massive potential going forward, that we just salivate at looking at the opportunities on the vitamin business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello from Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just want to start out with the share buyback discussion. Because if you look at 2Q, I guess, your stock was somewhere between $68 and $70. And you bought back $175 million, like you said you would. And with stock here at 64 and change, I was curious what your thought process is to buying back more stock. Why stop at $435 million? Why not, given the pullback, be more aggressive here?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, Joe, this is Matt. So we're -- we don't conduct ourselves as opportunistic buyers as moving in and out of the market depending on what the share price is. We're more deliberate about if we want to deploy a certain amount of cash and buy back shares and that's why we avail ourselves on accelerated stock repurchase, which as you know, once you make a decision, you get 90% of the shares upfront and you're done. So it's -- we don't look at it as we're running a trading desk. And as I said, we're far more interested in deploying the cash for acquisitions. That's the highest and best use of the capital.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So since you're not buying back anymore stock, should we read into that in terms of the health of the M&A market?","James R. Craigie","Joe -- your weight still down, Joe?","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes it is.","James R. Craigie","Go out for a run please.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","All right, last question for you. The guidance for this year, Matt, you did a good job of explaining the drivers in 4Q on the bottom line. But if you look at the top line, the organic growth number for 4Q, if you do 3% in the third quarter is going to be somewhere north of 4. So can you help us understand why you're going to see that step up in the fourth quarter on the organic growth side?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, as far as the fourth quarter goes, as we move through the year, there's less and less slotting, less and less couponing to simulate trial. The trial is -- pardon me, coupons are netted in the net sales number. And we're expecting the traction of our new products to really accelerate, as we move from the Q3 into Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just following up on a previous question. Jim, you guys have had a really good history of delivering on EPS goals. But when all your competitors are spending more, macros are worse and your peers are targeting lower outlooks, as you mentioned. Why is 7% to 9% still the right target range? And are you leaving yourself enough flexibility to respond in case -- in case stuff happens?","James R. Craigie","Well, I'll first answer that because we're better managers in business than they are. But stepping beyond that, no, I would -- hey, look, if I felt we couldn't get there in a quality way, I would lower my call. But I feel we can get there in a quality way. Again, Matt mentioned earlier, our marketing spending is going to be flat on the year. I think that's going to be better than other folks. We already saw the upfront buy in the TV industry, announcement that some of our major players have cut back on their TV spending going forward next year. We're, at least, keeping it flat. So again, we look at share of voice, which is how much of the advertising spending in the category you have, and we see us as having at least this -- our fair share or more to help grow our shares. And second quarter was great. I think for those -- so rest of the year, I feel pretty confident that we're well-positioned on a marketing spending base to drive our brand. If I didn't, I would think about cutting back the EPS. But I really feel the combination of our programs, our new products and everything will deliver our numbers. The June, July numbers were extremely encouraging to us. We banged record shares on 3 of our 4 mega brands in Q2. July is off to a great start. So I really feel good at this point. But it isn't like we just hold to a number, but I always wanted to do it in a quality way. And I think right now, we'll deliver those results with 7% to 9% earnings growth and exit the year with momentum. I've never wanted -- we've had consistent growth. I will never over-deliver a year and then put the next year at risk. So I always want year-to-year-to-year growth. We've had that. We've had 10 great years. I mean, you should know it pained me to not do a double-digit earnings EPS growth this year. I've had 10 straight years of running this company with double-digit EPS growth. So I had a cathartic experience only calling 7% to 9% growth. So already in Jim Craigie's world, I pulled down the call from the past 10 years of history, but I still feel we can do that result, which is better than almost all my competitors, do it in a quality way and exit the year with momentum.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just following up on the top line. Matt, you mentioned that couponing should decline as the year progresses, traction of new products should accelerate. So is this just a function of the fact that the comps are really particularly easy in the back half with price mix down pretty dramatically in the second half of '13? Or what -- I guess what gives you confidence that the couponing is going to decelerate as the year progresses? Or in the -- by Q4?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, the couponing -- remember, we have so many new products that are launching this year. And with new products, you're going to use coupons to simulate trial. You want people to try your new products. So once you start getting a trial and get repeat purchases, the coupons are going to start peeling back. That's why, as you move through the year, we're expecting we're going to have less in the fourth quarter, certainly in the third and then the second. And so kind of -- and we expect volumes to be better, as we move through the year for the consumer. They got -- we're better in Q2 than Q1, Q3 would be better than Q2, et cetera.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So even with competition getting quite a bit more difficult, you still feel pretty confident about your ability to accelerate the volume expansion in the back half of this year?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. As Jim said, we think the combination of the media spend and the trade programs that we have in place are going to drive the volumes in the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My question is really a follow-up to a couple of the others and including that one. I think to get to your guidance of gross margins being down 75 basis points for the year, they have to be down a lot less than the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So I mean, you've now guided to gross margins down 150 basis points in the third quarter. Why don't you have to keep up the pressure on gross margins? You just explained less slotting. But there's other promotions that hurt gross margins. Why does that 150 basis point gross margin hit in the third quarter not have to be the same in the fourth quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, a part of it is going to be mix year-over-year, Alice. So it's product mix and business mix. The Specialty Products business continues to perform year-over-year. And their gross margin have been up quite a bit. Actually, in the second quarter and year-over-year, we can expect that to continue as we get into the fourth quarter. And volumes drive a lot of variable margin, right? So if you have high variable margin on your volumes, it's going to have a -- variable margins are, of course, are higher than your gross margins is going to influence the fourth quarter. And again, as I said before, the trial couponing is -- are also part of the gross margin drag, and there'll be less of that in the fourth quarter.","James R. Craigie","Alice, to Matt's point, we have some businesses like Nair that are very seasonal in the summer. And there's quite a bit of spending behind them. They're very off-season in the fourth quarter.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Also true for SpinBrush, is also seasonal...","James R. Craigie","SpinBrush -- and conversely, we have very high margin businesses like TROJAN, which is -- has a big fourth quarter around the holidays and that. So it is a good case of product mix helping to drive that with some higher-margin products having a very strong -- traditionally strong fourth quarter and some of the higher trade businesses don't.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And here you have this huge hike in marketing in the second quarter and yet your sales are disappointing. So I mean, you don't think the category is becoming commoditized more than before?","James R. Craigie","No, I think -- Alice, again, we would've had a much stronger organic growth in the second quarter if we had addressed the trade issue earlier. Because once we then have the marketing and we took care of the trade issue on the laundry business, month of June was excellent and now month of July is even better. So I think you've got to understand that the marketing spending was worthwhile in creating awareness out there. And most of our other businesses was fine. The laundry business dragged us down a little bit in Q2 in the first 2 months because we had the pricing issues on the laundry business, which we fixed starting in June.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Going back to the laundry side. Can you maybe help us understand what's going on with XTRA? Because I guess it seems like most of the price wars have been kind of the mid-tier and even with simply coming down to the mid-tiers? And I would think that XTRA is so far down on the price chain that it wouldn't be as affected. Are you seeing consumers kind of trade up with the other discounts? Or is there something else going on and is that continuing into this quarter?","James R. Craigie","No, Bill, I wish what you said was true. XTRA has been hurt the most of our 2 brands because we don't advertise it. And some of the competitors have been so aggressive on their pricing, one in particular has been doing buy 1 get 2 frees, that it actually had more impact on XTRA than it had on ARM & HAMMER. So it's been just mainly the dealing with the fact that some of the competition at the lower end has -- XTRA doesn't have as many protections to it that the ARM & HAMMER brand does. There's more advertising, more new product news on ARM & HAMMER. And XTRA took some of the brunt. But we've taken actions to fix that. And I think you'll see improvement in XTRA results in the back half of the year.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then switching to gross margin. Would -- I mean, if you take out kind of the price war in liquid laundry, would you have seen gross margin improvement this year? And I guess I'm looking that in kind of the long-term algorithm of gross margin improvement every year and part of management's compensation, I mean do you -- are there plans in place or projects in place where we can get back on track assuming that the price war subsides at some point?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, Bill, when you think about new products, you -- there's so much couponing and slotting associated with that year-over-year so -- for trial, that, that depresses the gross margin of new products significantly. So that's -- in a year where you have lots of new products launches -- launching, you -- it's going to create pressure on gross margin. So what happens is, you get to next year, right? So now you're established, let's say OxiClean. So OxiClean is going into 3 new categories, right, high-end laundry detergent, dish and bleach. So next year, they're all established in those 3 categories, the slotting goes away, the couponing to stimulate trial peels off, and now the margins associated with those 3 products improved year-over-year.","James R. Craigie","Yes so Bill, we're always going a year of -- we're always going to launch a fair number of new products. 2014 was just an unprecedented number of new products. We will still have a great year of new products next year, but not what we have this year. So as Matt saying, the spending against those will peel back and that will really help the gross margin in 2015 versus 2014.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me. Matt, just, since I am not as up-to-speed as you are on the cattle industry, would you expect Specialty to be up double-digits this year in terms of the top line?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. And it's -- by the way, it's dairy, Bill, as opposed to cattle.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, well I thought it was all connected, but yes. On the dairy industry, would you expect -- I mean are we -- is 10% plus is at the right kind of number for this year?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, it is because if you'll -- in the first half alone, we've been -- we're up double-digit. First quarter, we were up 12% and second quarter up 22%.","James R. Craigie","Bill, the farmers -- the milk farmers love it when they have a situation where there's high milk prices that are still high and commodity cost -- it looks like it's going to be a record corn crop this year in the U.S., which should drive prices down. So it's an ideal environment for the milk out there because the farmers are getting a great price for their products and the commodity -- the input costs going in the feed is going to be low.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","And Bill, this is with respect to the Specialty Products business, just to remind everybody, it's sort of feast or famine with Specialty Products. And as Jim said, the last 2 years, 2012 and 2013, it's been a drag on our organic sales growth. 2011, you go back a few years, actually was a help to our total company organic sales growth. So I know we have -- really would like it always to be tracking the same way as consumer. It doesn't. This year, it's a help. It's going to be double-digits top line.","James R. Craigie","Yes and the early outlook on milk prices for 2015 is still very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Guys, I wanted to go back to vitamins for a second. Look, 10% growth is 10% growth, right? But with the gummy category, I think you said doubling its share of total vitamins. Are you getting as much of that incremental gummy piece that's growing as you would like? And if not, why? Like what has to change, if anything?","James R. Craigie","Yes, good question Chris. I mean, there's definitely more gummy competition out there. We are getting what we expected to. Double-digit growth, I think, is fantastic. And actually, the competition to me is very good because some of the bigger brands like Centrum and One A Day have moved in to the category. But that's great to me because, again, it's just telling consumers that gummy vitamins are just as good as hard pills. It's verifying the category. And again, it's still -- gummies are still less than 10% of the adult side. So I'll be very happy to take my fair share going forward of the 90% of the over $6 billion category that isn't gummy yet. And now, when you got the biggest guys in the space telling everybody they're just as good, go buy them. And I will bring you in one day and I'll sit you side-by-side and have you taste them. And ours by far taste better than any of theirs because we own our own plant. We have some unique proprietary technology in doing that thing. So there's just an advantage for us. But yeah, we've got new competition, but I look at that as a plus because, again, the biggest names in the industry have now verified that gummy vitamins are great and just as good as hard pills. And I can't imagine anybody who would still want to take a hard pill after eating a gummy vitamin.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Two questions. I guess the first one, if we could talk about the personal care business outside of Avid. And I know some of the innovation sounds pretty strong. But if you strip out the Avid piece that grew, it looks like the sales were weaker there. So can you talk about the innovation? And I know you're talking about June and July being a little bit stronger. Can you talk about maybe some of the promotional spending there and the results you're seeing? Because I know you've kind of laid out laundry a little bit and the reacceleration that you've seen. But could you talk maybe about the personal care outside of Avid? That's the first question.","James R. Craigie","Yes, Jason. sure. No, it's actually a very good portfolio. I mean, I just got results in for the month of July and the Nair brand hit an all-time record high. I told you TROJAN brand is hitting all-time record highs out there. So it's very good. The one business, kits -- kits has got great -- the pregnancy kits has great innovations on it. We're the first guys to the 6 day. There's a little bit of price competition there that's caused us to deal with on that side. But no, overall, still we have a brand called Batiste, which is largely an international business that's just locking out there, it's doing fantastic. We're expanding that in other countries around the world. So overall, the personal care business has actually been quite strong for us, for the last couple of quarters out there. And actually, our toothpaste business is also very strong. We started a campaign this year with a great new product with Alison Sweeney from The Biggest Loser TV show. And actually I can show you statistics that we're the fastest-growing brand in the toothpaste category in the last -- or the first 6 months of this year based on our results. So I mean, again, we're small and percentage-wise, it's a number, but we're doing great. So I'm very happy with personal care. And again, I go back to what I said to Alice before, so if it wasn't for some pricing issues in the laundry business, which we've now fixed, our organic growth would've been stronger in Q2. But now we fixed that, so this portfolio is on the back half of the year, which makes us feel so confident about delivering the numbers that, again, that EPS number that most guys aren't even near calling, but we feel confident of doing it next to the New York momentum.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we should see those sales numbers as you report them, sequentially improve?","James R. Craigie","Especially -- yes, well, especially in the laundry category. And the other categories should stay strong.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, fine. And then I guess the last question, and I'm not sure if you were listening to the P&G call before yours...","James R. Craigie","Who?","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, exactly. Well, it's interesting now because as they talk about focusing on the 70 or 80 core brands out there, obviously there's both an opportunity and a threat, I guess, to you guys a little bit more than before. The threat obviously, there's a greater focus on the laundry as one of the brands within that portfolio. And then the opportunity is, as you're looking at M&A, here's like a new kind of source for maybe you to tap into. So I was just wondering if I can get your initial reaction or thoughts without making your blood boil.","James R. Craigie","Yes -- no, I didn't hear their exact comments. I can just tell you, I have the highest respect for Procter & Gamble. And I do that because they do focus on driving their businesses through innovation, and I 100% agree with that. So I don't think P&G could be any more of a threat to us than they are today. They're already our biggest competitor in many categories. And -- but I like the way they compete, and I applaud that, and I want the competition to be the same way. As far as opportunity, hey, we always look at stuff. We bought the SpinBrush brand from them when they had to divest. It was a Gillette acquisition has been -- it's a great brand for us and we -- we always look at everything. So if there was something in their portfolio they were divesting that was of interest, we'd take a look. But again, it has to be a strong brand. We have to believe it's something we can grow going forward, and we'll have to see it. Again, I don't know what they're talking about exactly. I don't worry about them focusing more on their core business. I don't think they've had a lack of a focus on their core businesses. So I don't worry about increased threats from them because I always -- they're always #1 on my list when I think about who I need to worry about every day. And I'm sure -- I might be #20 on their list, but I think we're growing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What do you think the hangover is from all this laundry activity? Because if you look at the Nielsen data, like the baseline sales are way down. So clearly people are just buying because it's cheap. So [indiscernible] consumer service and stuff, you see this massive amount of pantry loading as well. So I'm just wondering what you guys think about kind of what happens 6 months down the road when people have 47 years of laundry detergent in their pantry.","James R. Craigie","That would be bad news if that happened, Bill. I haven't seen any evidence of the pantry loading. In fact, as I said before, I just saw the month of July results come in and I was actually quite happy. I mean, the category is going back north again towards a positive direction. So despite the increased price competition out there, so that was good to me. I -- I'm not -- I hear the issue. I -- we think about it. I haven't seen it yet. And I hope the category sooner rather than later gets back to being driven by innovation. So we'll see, consumers are getting a great deal right now with laundry detergent. But we'll see going forward. I have not seen evidence of the pantry loading. We watch our inventory situation versus consumption very carefully, and it's not showing any evidence of people loading up at this point.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Good. Okay. And then is that going to change broadly across the industry to couponing? Because if I wanted to, I can go on the Internet right now and get a free bottle of the [indiscernible] detergent. I can get free Tide. I mean, I've never seen it like this, just the pace of some of the couponing activity, and I was always under the assumption that couponing is dead. And I know it's not great for brand equity over time. So how do you guys think about that and how long do you think it's going to last?","James R. Craigie","Yes, I tend to agree with you Bill. I mean, couponing has been up for a couple of years now. I mean, it's been up. We just -- I mean, we mentioned in laundry, it just seemed to pick up especially early this year from our -- some of our competitors in those category. I'm a big believer with you. We have a philosophy. We largely like to use couponing just for trial of new products and then not after that. However, we've seen our competitors now start to subsidize price, which to me -- if you put that on top of high trade deals, it's just ridiculous to us. But I can't control what they do. So we're making sure we're competitive out there. And I think some of them someday are going to study what's happening to them, and they're going to realize they are over-subsidizing consumers. And to your point, I think destroying brand equity when they start to get people thinking of only buying on deals. So again, I can only take care of Church & Dwight here, and we're being prudent on what we do to drive our business. And the results in the last 2 months, especially in laundry, are very encouraging to us.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. and then just lastly, is there any update on the whole next wave of compaction thing that Walmart has mandated for 2018, I guess?","James R. Craigie","Bill, I'll just say it's on the table for discussion. And beyond that, as far as timetables of what it is, I can't comment anymore at this point in time.","Okay. Everybody, you've exhausted us. It's been a great morning. Very happy with our call today. I appreciate the time. I know you got a very busy day today between -- most of you are probably were on call with Procter this morning, you've got us, and there's like one other competitor following us here.","So anyways, I'm thrilled with our second quarter results. Very optimistic about the back half of the year. And I just appreciate the time you took today. If you have any questions or follow-ups, please give us a call. We'll do our best to answer them. Otherwise, thank you very much. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day."],"5148":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) Q3 2016 Earnings Call November  3, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Richard A.

(Broker)","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Operator","Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for the call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Also please limit during the Q&A, your questions to one initial and one follow-up. Sir, please go ahead.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for today. I'll provide some color on the quarter and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker. When Rick is finished, we'll open the call up for questions.","The Q3 was a solid quarter for our company. EPS exceeded our outlook, organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our August outlook of 1% to 2%. We would have been at the high end of the range if not for a far worse than expected result in our animal nutrition business which was an unexpected 70 basis points drag on the outlook.","The quality of earnings was high this quarter. We expanded gross margin, we invested in higher marketing of 50 bps and SG&A was lower year-over-year. We overcame a high tax rate, a small product recall, and a big decline in our animal nutrition business and still beat our EPS outlook by $0.01.","Our Consumer business delivered volume-driven organic sales growth of 2.5%, led by continued strong growth by our international Consumer business. In the U.S., our organic sales growth met our expectations, reflecting higher couponing as we communicated back in August. The good news is category growth was broad-based. Ten of our 15 categories grew in the quarter.","Now, I'm going to say a few words about four of our categories. The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 4% year-over-year, and our laundry business grew with the category. This is the sixth quarter in a row of laundry category growth driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments.","In liquid laundry detergent, this quarter marked the 27th consecutive quarter of share growth for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry. In contrast, our XTRA brand lost share in the quarter, as we continued to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q2, we expect XTRA net profits to increase year-over-year for full-year 2016, and we have plans to turn around that brand.","Also in the liquid category, OXICLEAN grew share to 1.8%, driven by strong promotional support. As we have said before, we are committed to OXICLEAN laundry detergent. We are encouraged by the trial activity in this most recent quarter, and our repeat rate continues to improve.","Turning to the unit dose segment, our unit dose products continued to gain traction and had some of the largest gains in the category. For the second consecutive quarter ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew twice the unit dose category growth rate. And our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Most important, our unit dose business was equally driven by base and promoted volume, signaling a healthy balance. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 50 basis points to 3.2% share in the quarter. Similarly, OXICLEAN unit dose also grew share in the quarter and is now a 1.1% share. These are encouraging signs as we continue to go in the right direction.","Finally in fabric care, the stain fighter category grew 3.2%. OXICLEAN grew consumption 7% and is the leading stain fighter in the additive category with a 48% share. OXICLEAN grew share 170 basis points in the quarter.","The litter category continues to be very competitive with increased couponing. For the quarter, the litter category was up 3.7%, while our brands were flat in measured channels. Our shipments were up as our online litter business more than doubled. Long-term we have won in this category through innovation, which continues to be our focus.","Now we'll talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3.8%. The gummy segment of VMS grew 10% in Q3, which includes both adult gummies up 14% and children's gummies down 5%. Our adult brand VITAFUSION had another good quarter, growing consumption 9.7% with the success of our new products. L'IL CRITTERS children's gummy had a great quarter and grew consumption 6.6% compared to a 5% decline in the category. This is the second consecutive quarter that we have outpaced the children's gummy category.","Today the gummy form of the entire adult VMS category is 10%. It was 3% when we bought the business four years ago. VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS are the number one brands, with shares of 28% and 30% in measured channels respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us.","The last category I'll address is dry shampoo. This category grew almost 27% in Q3 after growing 26% in Q1 and 28% in Q2. The category in the U.S. is now over $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category if we match the historical category growth experienced in the UK where the product originated. BATISTE is the number one brand in the U.S. with a 23.6% share. The BATISTE brand is expected to be one of the fastest-growing brands in the future for us.","Now I'm going to talk about International. Our International Consumer business has emerged as a growth driver for Church & Dwight. After growing 3% to 4% annually from 2011 to 2014, our International business grew 8% in 2015 and is expected to hit 9% in 2016.","BATISTE is only part of the story. Many brands have contributed to the success story. We have enjoyed stellar growth in Europe, Canada, and Mexico this year, while our export business continues to open new doors for our brands. We look forward to steady, strong growth from the International business in the future.","Our Q3 total company organic growth was held back by significantly lower volume in our animal nutrition business, which reflects depressed milk prices. When we began the year we expected full-year growth from this business to be 1% to 3%, and now we're expecting a 9% decline on a full-year basis. That is quite a reversal.","Thanks to the strength of our Consumer business, we expect to deliver 8% EPS growth and 3% organic growth for full-year 2016. We said we're early in our 2017 planning process; we'll say more about that in February, but for now we again expect high-single digit EPS growth next year.","Next up is Rick to give you details about third quarter results, the outlook for Q4 and the full-year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share, compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook.","Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million, organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our 1% to 2% range, but at the lower end, dragged down by the 70 basis point hit from our SPD business. When we spoke to you in August, we assumed a 3% decline in that business versus the 11% decline we experienced.","Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 0.8% in the quarter. Volume growth was solid at 2.1%, offset by 1.3% drag from pricing. Now we expected approximately 1% organic for that business as we had anticipated the incremental couponing to support our new products and Q4 promotional shifts. As mentioned, we were a little below 1%, as we also got hit with returns due to a small product recall from our Orajel business.","I know you guys are a fan of stacked numbers. So I wanted to call out our volume results for Q3. Of the 3.5% stack organic, all of it is volume. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect organic sales to be 2.5% for the Domestic business. That translates to maintaining our full-year organic sales outlook of 3%.","Consumer International organic growth was up an impressive 12.1%. BATISTE continues to build depth of distribution in many countries, OXICLEAN and ARM & HAMMER continue to expand in North America and TROJAN continues to do well in Latin America. We're raising our expectation for the full-year organic growth from 7% to approximately 9% for the International business.","To recap, 3% for the Consumer Domestic business for the full-year and 9% for the Consumer International business equates to 4% full-year growth for the global Consumer business and we are really pleased with that result.","For our SPD division, organic sales were down 11.5%. Milk prices continue to be low due to an excess global supply of milk and weak exports due to a strong dollar. As said in the past, we like this business but we do experience these cycles from time to time. On the bright side, the industry does forecast a slight improvement in milk prices in 2017.","Turning now to gross margin, our reported third-quarter gross margin was 45.4%, a 60 basis point increase from year ago, primarily due to lower commodities in our productivity programs. Q3 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 40 basis points, productivity programs and lower manufacturing costs worth 60 basis points. We also had 30 basis points from higher margin acquired business and going the other way we had a drag of 50 basis points from price\/volume mix, as we had the higher promotional investments, largely the couponing we discussed earlier, plus we had a 20 basis point drag from currency.","Now moving to marketing, we increased marketing spend by 5.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 50 basis points to 11.3%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.6%, a 30 basis point decrease from the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the timing of R&D spend and lower litigation costs.","Now on to operating margin, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 22.5%, which is 40 basis points higher than the prior year, and the other good news is as a proxy for cash earnings, our EBITDA margin was up to 26% in the quarter.","Next income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 35.6% and we continue to expect our full-year rate to be 35%.","Turning to cash, we had a really strong cash flow quarter. On a year-to-date basis we have generated $495 million of cash from operations, an $86 million increase from the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher cash earnings and improved working capital.","So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include a strong consumer organic growth rate of 2.5%, increased gross margin expansion as we exceeded our outlook by $0.01, even after absorbing a hit from the SPD revenue decline and a small product recall.","Turning now to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%. The Consumer business is expected to pick up steam in the fourth quarter at 2.5% organic growth while we expect the dairy business to be down 13% and a drag on the total company organic sales growth.","We expect fourth-quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.42, compared to $0.41 a share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year. For context, the significant year-over-year decline in SPD revenues equates to $0.01 drag to the EPS line. And we also have a higher tax rate that equates to about $0.01. You may recall the Q4 2015 tax rate had the full-year R&D credit all in one quarter.","Turning to the full-year, we now expect organic sales growth to be at the lower end of our 3% to 4% range, which reflects the previously discussed headwind from our Specialty Products Division.","We continue to expect gross margin expansion of 110 basis points due to continued lower commodity costs and greater distribution efficiencies. And we also continue to expect 60 basis points of full year operating margin expansion and to deliver 8% EPS growth.","Finally, we now expect $650 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $600 million of free cash flow, which represents over 125% free cash flow conversion.","Now, Matt and I will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hi, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hope all is well. A quick question on margins, I know we usually have to wait for the Q on this, but can you give us some of the color in terms of the gross margin bridge, the puts and takes that drove the increase this quarter?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes, sure. I tried to do that in my script the last few quarters. But continued improvement from commodities was worth 40 basis points. Productivity, manufacturing improvements was worth 60 basis points. Negative price\/volume mix was a drag of 50 basis points, and that's largely the couponing that we talked about \u2013 and that's for the whole company. Acquisitions was worth 30 basis points higher margin businesses and then a drag of 20 basis points for FX.","Now, as you know, the commodity benefit will start to continue to go down and that's in our expectations for Q4. For example, commodities by itself, Q1 was a benefit of 120 basis points, Q2 70 basis points, Q3 40 basis points and we expect 10 basis points in Q4.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Thank you. I know we're not going to get into a lot of detail on 2017 yet, but you did put some numbers out there this morning, and in there you talk about ongoing progression in gross margins expected for next year. What are some of the puts and takes that give you confidence in your ability to get there, given that as you just pointed out, the commodity tailwind should be dissipating?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, I think you're exactly right. In general for commodities next year we think it's pretty benign with the exception of surfactants which is going to be up we believe in 2017, but remember, we have our evergreen productivity program and that's really the driver behind gross margin expansion all the time and sometimes that's masked by the commodity impact.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful, guys. I'll pass it on.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Matt, I wanted to start on the SPD business, and I guess given what milk prices did there a disappointing result, does a quarter like this give you any pause with respect to the fit in the portfolio. I think your commentary in the past has been around a relatively comparable margin profile, somewhat attractive return on operating asset kind of business, but I guess the rebuttal would be it seems to be non-core and arguably a distraction. If investors wanted exposure to dairy prices, they could do so by investing in other assets.","And I guess more fundamentally, a concern could potentially be that from one quarter to the next you could be in a position where you're faced with pulling back on investment behind a mega brand as milk prices tank in order to hit the guide on the quarter. So if you can revisit I guess some thoughts there and whether a quarter like this gives you any pause that'd be helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, Kevin. That's a good question. I'm sure a lot of people would question their hearts because the business had such a falling off of this quarter versus even our expectations when we spoke to everybody in August. But we do take the long view on this business, so we don't look at it as simply a \u2013 the dairy business that it is today, and it is one-dimensional. It's largely doing business in the U.S. and largely in dairy, but we've changed the focus of that business from simply dairy to animal productivity and what we did was we bought this business a year and a half ago called Vi-COR, early 2015. And what that did was that got us into poultry, swine and cattle, and also some international products. So it got us exposure to other species.","So we want to even out the cycles over time by growing into other species and also with more acquisitions. So you might say well, if I want to invest in an animal productivity business, I can go to Zoetis or one of these other companies. And I would say, look, this is an asset light business. We have the good fortune of the legacy business of this company, which is sodium bicarbonate, having morphed out of that into animal productivity. And we have a lot of science in that part of the company, which is probably not well understood, PhD chemists, veterinarians, et cetera. So we have a great nucleus of people to build upon.","And because it's asset light, because you know we're a cash driven company, has all the characteristics we want to grow over time. And the big macro is you got 7 billion people today, going to 9 billion in 2050. So it's a long answer, but it probably deserves a long answer considering the fact that it influenced the numbers this quarter.","Now, looking ahead to 2017, the good news is the milk prices are forecasted to start recovering next year, so it's not going to be as bad next year as this year, so we would expect some growth out of the Specialty Products business in 2017. But it's certainly a legitimate question, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Matt. And a follow up here, the Consumer organic sales guidance for 4Q, if I'm not mistaken, is 2.5%, and even \u2013 so when I take a look at the comps, that still implies some slowing in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that. The Personal Care number was a little bit weak in the third quarter. I don't know if there is an expectation that persists, and then what exactly is driving that dynamic. Is there more couponing and heavier trade spend given what's going on in laundry right now, where that's ramped. So just if you could help sort of help me understand a bit what's driving the two-year average slowdown into the fourth quarter as well. Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Sure, Kevin. It's Rick. Now remember, a couple things here. We had a great VMS second half in 2015. We had recovered in a big way from all the cuts we experienced in the back half of 2014 and early 2015. So the back half was like 5.5% growth, for example, and the first half was flat. So to some degree, the comps were influenced by \u2013 the slowdown was influenced by that. That's number one. Number two, we do have some incremental couponing to drive trial. That was largely a Q3 event, but we do have a little bit in Q4. And in general, Q4 going to 2.5% organic is a predominantly volume driven result. And there's a little bit of price mix in there too, but Personal Care growth, which was a little bit negative in Q3, is expected to recover and be slightly positive in Q4 as well. So hope that helps. That's a little bit more color.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A couple things. What's the endgame with all this cat litter promotional activity, because it's not like a super high return category. I'm just not sure why \u2013 it seems like a zero-sum. So like why do you think the activity is so pronounced now and how long do you think it will last, and maybe you think it abates a little bit as commodities start to firm or even rise a little bit going forward?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Bill, it's a good question. We've been on the sidelines with respect to the amount sold on deal. So we're not the offender, but there's been a tremendous amount of couponing by the other two players in litter. And obviously, they're promoting some of the new products that they have. But for our part, shipments were up in the quarter, and our new product, which is MICROGUARD, is the second highest repeat rate in litter only behind the original CLUMP & SEAL. So Nestl\u00e9, which is Tidy Cat, they're the big winner this past quarter, and we lost some share. So our view is that when we have innovation -- and you know us, we always do have something coming -- that's the time to promote heavily. But we're not part of the war right now.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. So when you talk about the mix impact to the gross margin line, it wasn't necessarily in cat litter?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Well, look, cat litter was up for the quarter year-over-year sales-wise, and as we also said that we did pretty well in the online class of trade as well.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. And remember we said price\/volume mix was a 50 basis point drag. That's predominately price in the quarter, predominantly couponing.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Mostly in the laundry...","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Mostly in the laundry.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","...category. It's not in litter, that price hit.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got you. And then, just, it's kind of a new business you guys haven't really talked about, but this export business. I mean, is it as simple as that like you kind of load up like a 40-foot container and ship a bunch of products to some country where you don't have a discrete sales force, or am I missing...?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","You obviously had a college job on the docks. Now look, we're doing what a lot of businesses did 20 years, 30 years ago. We have \u2013 it's not just export, it's the international team is extremely strong. We have a strong management team. Have some new general managers in a couple countries and we've been able to grow international through a combination of local brands and U.S. brands.","In North America, ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN and TROJAN are doing really well in Canada and Mexico, even a more recent acquisition, remember those vaginal moisturizers we bought, REPHRESH and REPLENS doing well in Europe. But in export we've been adding people and resources in Central America and in Southeast Asia. That opens up a lot of new countries for us. And yeah, sure I mean, as far as the manner in which you ship, certainly we're shipping to distributors around the world, but we've got a terrific distributor network out there and that's one of the strengths of that business.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. And then one last quick one if I could sneak it in. Has there been any change in the industry about what Henkel is doing with All and to a lesser extent Wisk. I guess the planograms get set again in March for the category. I mean, are you hearing any rumblings there?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. Look, this is \u2013 the time of year is fall when you're doing all your line reviews and you're not going to really find out about planograms until Jan, Feb, March, in the spring. So that's still a jump ball.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks so much.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Just a follow-up on Bill Schmitz's. So if you're not \u2013 couponing is not really around litter, is it \u2013 and we're talking about new products that it is focused, is it primarily around pods? I mean is that the big focus?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. No. No. Yeah. No, here is the way to think about it when you think about laundry. So, liquid laundry detergent had the highest percentage sold on deal as a category, in the past two years and in Q3. We were significantly under that. So we have not ramped it up. We've had steady amount sold on deal for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry for the past couple of quarters. The same is true for unit dose.","My remarks what I said, was that unit dose is growing and it's balanced between the on deal and base. So where the couponing is for us is in OXICLEAN. So OXICLEAN as you know, we launched a couple years ago. And then Persil came on the scene, then we went sideways for a while. So we've got to work a lot harder to get trial. And it's been working for us, but it's been costly. So the couponing that we're referring to is largely for OXICLEAN in laundry.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, Rick, on the gross margin bridge you walked through, where would I \u2013 I mean, both on kind of the easier comparisons from the vitamin start-up and then also, I assume there was a mix benefit from the decline in Specialty, that that would have actually helped gross margin. Is that right? And would that fall in \u2013 where would that fall in, in that bridge?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. You're exactly right, Bill, on both counts. Well, remember the VMS start-up expenses really did start to dissipate as we got into Q3 and Q4 a year ago. Those were predominantly even more help in Q2. And remember, we had 130 basis points in Q2 a year ago \u2013 last quarter, as a manufacturing benefit. This quarter it was only 60 basis points because we \u2013 those start-up expenses did dissipate a year ago.","As far as mix for actual division mix? Yeah, you're right. The decline in SPD probably threw off around, I don't know, 10 basis points, 15 basis points, and that would be the mix line.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then last one for me. Matt, I guess, in two out of the past three years, I think, you've done ASRs for your shares, and just because cash was sitting on the sidelines and it was a good use of it. Why just this authorization today and then in kind of your initial guidance for next year of high single-digit EPS growth, is there an assumption of a lower share count or is that not factored in yet?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'll take that, Bill. Generally, we've done, in the past few years between $200 million to $400 million of share buyback. And our authorization \u2013 we only had about $130 million left. And so just typically this year as we do our planning cycle, we go to the board and say, hey, here's our refresh for our share authorization.","In the last two years we've done $500 million. We're doing $500 million again. So that's kind of a consistent approach. It doesn't mean we're going to do $500 million. I will say that if \u2013 we will be selective when we \u2013 depending on what the share price is, to either ramp that up or ramp that that down. But we do have an assumption of share count in our plan and we'll go through that probably in February.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And ASRs are still possible?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","ASRs are possible. The 10b5-1s are also possible. It just depends.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Sounds good. Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Powers of UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hi, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So just to go back again to Bill Schmitz's litter question and just carry forward the logic of your answer, you might not be the primary actor today. But if you've always got something new coming to promote behind, it would follow that you've probably got something new coming in cat litter. And therefore might that not be just the catalyst for the current battles to continue? Or is \u2013 I guess to Bill's question, is there something that breaks the cycle?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Steve, part of it is we believe innovation wins. At the end of the day the product sells itself. And so you have to do trial, you have to do everything else to promote your product and get it in the hands of consumers.","But at the end of the day our belief in litter and that's why we didn't even exist in the 1990s in litter and we're up to the number two brand in litter today \u2013 is it's innovation. And so all this price competition is what it is and we're kind of holding our own. Sales are slightly up in the quarter despite all this amount sold on deal and couponing. But we believe innovation trumps all of that.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, fair enough. And I know the pressures that led to the lower guidance this quarter were really Specialty Products related. But just taking a step back and listening to the full slate of HPC companies that have reported so far, it seems like demand trends remain broadly challenged. Competitive pressures are rising and they are rising certainly more so in certain pockets. But broadly, they are rising. And deflationary benefits are turning into inflationary pressures as you look forward. And all together, that's not really a great combination. So I guess, I'd just love your perspective on that, again, broadly speaking.","And then specific to your business, I think how those dynamics impact laundry is probably the most critical factor as you think about 2017. So if there's a way for you to focus your comments on how they are shaping your 2017 planning in that category specifically, that would be great as well.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Steve, this is probably a better question to ask first week of February because then we will be talking about what innovation we have by category for next year because as you know, the CPG business is a shelf space game. So the more shelf space, the more market share and you need innovation to bump the other guy off the shelf and take more share and get more facing. So it's an innovation story frankly, for 2017. And that's why we would have the confidence to say hey, we're going to hit our evergreen model again in 2017.","Your larger question might be about the economy. And of course we see everything that you see. Unemployment is pretty steady but GDP is only 1.5% and gasoline prices creeping up, healthcare costs noticeably increasing for consumers and a median household income around $51,000. So that is the consumer. So obviously, that's hitting the consumer in the pocketbook. So it's \u2013 I wouldn't say it's the best outlook for the consumer. But from our point of view, we think that we have so many different ways to win here.","We have \u2013 we've got 10 brands. We got a great International business. And Specialty Products has its ups and downs, but that will be back next year. So we sort of have a 12-cylinder engine. As we showed in this quarter, if some of them are misfiring, others will. And we are able to hit our numbers. So we aim to hit the numbers again next year, just as we did this year.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","And, Steve, just want to add to that is \u2013 Matt had the commentary. But laundry category up 4%, still strong; vitamin category, up 10%, great tailwind; BATISTE category up 20%. So there's a lot of good things happening despite in some other categories where there is more competitive pressure.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Okay, that's all fair. That's all fair. And I may have missed this, but did you call out any early indication on the stock option compensation accounting change and how that's going to impact your tax rate and earnings algorithm next year?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, we haven't done it yet. It's a pretty simple calculation but we'll probably do that next quarter, give you guys an outlook.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","On that specific piece of it.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","You got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to International, and looking at the hockey stick that you guys alluded to earlier beginning in 2015 and now 2016 in terms of organic growth, I'm trying to tease out \u2013 I don't know if there's a way to do it, how much of that growth is coming from sort of like-for-like same-store sales, and how much of that is coming from expanded distribution of certain brands?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","You talking about country by country now...?","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","No, no, just in general, just in general. Yeah, the 9% you're looking at today. How much of that is a like-for-like growth number?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. The predominant of that is like-for-like growth. We were in existing countries. We are doing depth of distribution for BATISTE. ARM & HAMMER is doing great in Canada and Mexico. So it's an existing \u2013 and it's in our existing footprint.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, Joe. It would be the export business that would be new doors, new shelves, new countries. That's the expanding piece of it.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So in terms of the impact on the P&L, what's the margin impact from that faster growth in International? What's the drag?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Why do you think there's a drag from that, Joe?","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I would just assume there would be a drag. I would assume your Consumer Domestic business would be a more profitable business. Is that a wrong assumption?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Right. Remember, as we are growing internationally, a lot of those sales, remember, are Personal Care in nature versus a Household in nature. So yeah, we have Household Products in Canada and Mexico. But export business is predominantly more like a BATISTE or a Femfresh, which is Personal Care margins. So you are right, it has a better distributor margin, so maybe at the net you have a lower number, but it's on par because it's PC brands.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, secondly, on laundry, you mentioned 4% category growth despite pretty significant couponing going on there. How much of that is coming from the base liquid business and how much of that is from unit dose and people using more product in the unit dose category?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","The unit dose is the bigger grower of the two versus...","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. I'm just thinking \u2013 how much is the base of the business up?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, let me see if I have the liquid \u2013 talking about how much did the liquid category grow for example. Is that what you are asking?","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes, exactly, because you have obviously seen a lot of companies talk about using two and three units per load, which is obviously driving volume growth.","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes, we think most of it is volume growth, Joe, but we'll have to circle back and give you the number specifically.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, no problem. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Caroline Levy of CLSA. Your line is open.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you and good morning. I noticed four of your 10 power brands had share gains. That seems to be a number that's coming down over time. And just wondering what gives you \u2013 or where would you expect that number to be a year from now? Obviously, the goal is 10 out of 10, but what do you believe you can change to make that a different number?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes, we've had four this quarter, four last quarter. And as you know, we are more transparent than other CPG companies in that we call out our brands and we give ourselves a report card and let our analysts and investors know as well. So the four that were up were, BATISTE, VMS, OXICLEAN and Nair. So you'd say, okay, what about the other six? So one was flat; that was ARM & HAMMER. So we had growth in laundry, but that was offset by litter. So if you said, is there one that you would expect to improve next year, yeah, it would be ARM & HAMMER. So four would become five.","So then you say, what are the other ones? The other ones would be TROJAN. So TROJAN, we had lost some share in measured channels, but we have strong growth in untracked channels, and that will continue to be probably a bigger part of the discussion measuring brand growth in measured channels versus all-in, which is harder to get your arms around. XTRA is certainly one that we've been suffering because of deep competitive discounting. So have been more or less on the sidelines there. So that one, we expect to turn around and obviously, it's pretty obvious what that's going to take.","Orajel, there has been some pressure from private-label but we have an improved product offering that's coming out in Q4 to distinguish ourselves again further from private label, so we hope that's going to have a positive impact.","FIRST RESPONSE, the issue there is we have some retailers experimenting with the split between branded and private label. And SPINBRUSH last quarter, adult grew 10% and kids was soft. This quarter it's the reverse. Kids was way up and adult was soft. But the business grew, just not at the same pace as the category.","So yeah, it's a mixed bag. If you said what would be a good score? Every quarter would be, we'd say six. If you can get six out of 10 every quarter that would be fantastic. I think stellar would be seven to eight. But nine to 10 is aspirational, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. Yes. Jumping to International, if you're guiding to 9% sales growth for the year, which I think you are, that would be a big slowdown in the fourth quarter, is there something there?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, Caroline. We've incorrectly called this for two or three quarters. We kept on thinking International would come back down to earth and be mid-single digits, and I think we just maybe called it a little too early, and so this is really just the reality. The business is a great business, it's, we think, going to grow mid-single digits for a long time. On the edges, Europe is slowing down a little bit and Australia as well. But in general, 5% \u2013 4% or 5% in Q4 is still a solid growth number.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, and we should expect long-term that if we're calling 3% for the company that we would expect the International business to be higher than that year-after-year.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. And then lastly, it's a little more detail, but you've said a lot about laundry, but I'm asking if you could tell us a little bit more about specifically what you think the acquisition of Sun might do, what you actually see, if you're seeing anything yet out of Procter, (39:10) are they stepping up their promotional activity. What's changing there?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. I can't take a swing at that one, Caroline. I wouldn't comment on what's going on with Henkel and Sun. I mean, they just closed the acquisition and \u2013 but I haven't seen anything different as far as discounting goes. They've been discounting heavily all year long, Purex and Sun. So, there's been no change to that since the acquisition.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay, Caroline.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, also I'd like to remind you to please keep your questions to one initial question and one follow-up. Our next question is from Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, some CPG companies have been talking about seeing some retailer destocking. I was just wondering is there anything that you've been seeing in any of your FDM customers at this point?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. I mean, you do hear that from time to time over the years. But I don't think that ever happens. I think the retailers are as focused on working capital as anybody else. So I think they run pretty tight ships. So it's unusual to have a situation where a retailer is overstocked and they're cutting back on their inventories.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then the last question. I know you mentioned TROJAN before. Just been seeing some of these articles out there talking about millennials don't like condoms. So I was just wondering how do you respond to that in terms of growing that business, and what are you seeing on your end?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Look, there is always going to be a certain percentage of the population that doesn't enjoy sex with a condom. But that's been a great business for a long period of time where we've got a 75% share. And being the big dog in the category, it's up to us to continue to promote safe sex and compliance.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's a good answer. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","All right. See you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. So, in Q4, you're looking for a 1% to 2% organic sales growth. So obviously implied in that guidance is a potential that there could be acceleration from Q3. So can you talk about what gives you confidence in seeing that potential acceleration, are there incremental programs going in place? Obviously, you've got a little bit of a stepdown in comps, but that didn't quite help that much in Q3. So can we talk through that first please?","Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Sure. It's a couple things. Number one, we don't have the tactical (41:54) couponing on OXICLEAN to the same degree that we did in Q3. We don't have the impact of the Orajel product returns\/recall. On a positive note, our vitamin business and our laundry business has some promotions in Q4 that some of them were in Q3 a year ago. So we feel pretty good about the 2.5% that we called for the Consumer Domestic division. That's probably where your head is around","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thanks. And then just on the dry shampoo, you guys have talked a little bit about the $300 million opportunity if you can get to the UK level. So can you talk about the similarities you see between the two markets? And then how much of that growth that you've seen so far is new distribution versus the underlying strength within the category? And if it does continue to grow at these levels, what about the competitive threat from others entering the category and potentially chipping away at your share?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good questions. So here is the way to think about it. There are about 60 million people in the UK and in U.S. dollars the consumption of dry shampoo is about $60 million. So when we look the U.S., we say, hey, we've got 335 million people in the U.S. were we to have a similar use consumption in the U.S., you'd a $300 million category. So it is as simple as that.","As far as where is the growth coming from, it's not simply \u2013 it is new distribution, but it's higher consumption. The category continues to grow and the good news for us is that the category is growing rapidly and our share keeps expanding. So our share expanded from Q2 to Q3 in a category that's growing rapidly.","And what we have going for us is that, BATISTE is viewed as a European brand, number one. And number two, its efficacy is far better than anything else that's on the market. So it's really product performance is what's winning. So people who have not used our product and then switch to BATISTE, they don't go back. So it's \u2013 we're not concerned about other entrants. There are a lot of people in there already, Your Mother's, TRESemm\u00e9, et cetera. So there's plenty of big dogs in the category. So we certainly like our chances. We're number one dry shampoo globally not just in the U.S.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, and thanks for fitting me in. Most of my questions are answered. But one I wanted to ask on the M&A front. So clearly in the public markets we've seen some of the froth come out of consumer staples valuation. I was just curious, as you guys are looking out there, are you seeing better valuations, better opportunities out there in your M&A search?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yeah, that's a hard one to answer. I wouldn't say I can make any sweeping comment about multiples going up or down. As you know, we are an acquisitive company, so anything that is for sale in CPG, 99 out of 100 times we will get the book. But I wouldn't say that the market has peeled off or gotten any worse.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then going back to your Specialty Products division, clearly the dairy market challenges has been an issue weighing on that business are there any other competitive dynamics at play in terms of the weakness that you've been seeing?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No, that's good question. So it's not a function of losing share. It's entirely due to demand. The interesting thing about that business is that once a dairy farm starts using your products and particularly the ARM & HAMMER, so a lot of our products we sell under the ARM & HAMMER name and it creates a lot of weight that goes with that. So once you are with the producer, they are going to stick with you. So it's not switching or share, it's just purely demand.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Hey, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just two quick questions. Hey, guys. Are you guys seeing any activity with the retailer kind of prompting more promotional activity on behalf of the suppliers, meaning kind of the, what I call the retailer reach back given some of the traffic issues they're dealing with in the face of the economy, and also e-commerce? That's the first question.","And then the second question is just thinking about the International business. What's the vision and the strategy on that business. I mean, are you going to take kind of like a Clorox approach and just focus on a couple of countries or do you believe that you have some more white space opportunity to expand your footprint?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Yes. Let's take the International one first. So we have a business in Mexico and Brazil, so we'd like to go where the people are. So there's over 100 million people in Mexico and there's 200 million people in Brazil. So those would be a focus for us.","And then there are countries we're not in, like Germany for example, which is the largest, strongest economy in Europe. So longer term we'd say, yes, that's a place we'd want to be in.","And then export is one that is just a fountain for us because we have found that our products do travel well and we have built an export team. We have a great leadership there and we think the sky is the limit with respect to driving our product internationally. So I think that's sort of the view with respect to International, Nik. That's why we're so positive about it.","Your front end question was are we seeing more asks on part of the retailers?","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, just generally speaking are you seeing more kind of promotional activity because the retailer is kind of pressing on the suppliers?","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","No. I would say no more than in the past. Our retailers, they are in a very competitive business, obviously but I wouldn't say there's any trend that we've experienced.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thanks, Matt.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Farrell for closing remarks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, everybody for joining us today, and we'll talk to you again in February.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"4607":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

LLC","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you about our business. I'll start with a brief review of our first quarter results, which you read about in this morning's press release. I will then direct the rest of my comments towards our categories. Then, I'm going to turn the call over to Rick Dierker when I'm done. Rick will comment on each business \u2013 that's Domestic, International, and Specialty Products \u2013 and also review the outlook for Q2 and for the full year. When Rick is finished, I'll get back on and we'll open the call up to questions.","So here are the highlights. In short, Q1 was a terrific quarter for Church & Dwight. We delivered organic sales growth of 5.2% and 7.5% EPS growth, which is 10% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. Category growth was broad based in that 11 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective, six of our 10 power brands grew share; so all-in, these results are top tier in consumer products.","Now, I would like to provide you with some color on a few of our categories; that would be laundry, litter, vitamins, and dry shampoo. The laundry category is strong, growing 6.4% versus year ago. This is the fourth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 6.1%, and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of value segment growth. In fact, for the last four quarters, value has grown, on average, 4.5% per quarter.","The laundry category growth was driven by growth in both the unit dose and liquid segments. The value liquid segment grew at an 8% clip, driven by ARM & HAMMER liquid, which grew consumption a whopping 11% year-over-year.","With respect to unit dose, this form now represents 15% of the laundry category. Our unit dose consumption grew 15% in the quarter. More recently, we have launched new two-chamber unit dose products under the OXICLEAN and ARM & HAMMER brands. We expect these new products to contribute to future consumption growth. Most of the resets for these launches happened in late March and early April.","Now, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about our three laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years and the ARM & HAMMER laundry share continued to grow this quarter, up 30 basis points. To illustrate the strength of the ARM & HAMMER brand, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 25 consecutive quarters.","Our XTRA brand backed off promotional volume in Q1, which improved our year-over-year profitability, but resulted in our giving up 40 basis points of share. On a full-year basis, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to be up year-over-year.","OXI laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year as we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity. In the most recent four-week period, we are back to a one share, so promotional phasing does influence shares. If we look at how OXICLEAN is doing in the stain fighter additive category, OXICLEAN's share hit an all-time high of 48% share.","Now, I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment continued to show strong growth at 5.3%. ARM & HAMMER litter was one of the winners in the quarter. We continue to grow faster than the segment. Our consumption grew 6.7%, behind our latest innovation, MICROGUARD CLUMP & SEAL litter.","Just a quick commercial, MICROGUARD seals and destroys odors and prevents future bacterial odors from forming. It's an innovative product and we are broadcasting that message on our package, that 98% of consumers who have tried the product would recommend it.","Now, let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The gummy segment of VMS grew almost 15% in Q1. So let me break down the 15% for you. The adult gummy segment grew 23%, while the kids gummy segment declined 8%.","Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus as it is underdeveloped and it will be the source of future growth for us. Our brand, VITAFUSION, is the largest brand in the adult gummy category and was the biggest driver of the 23% adult segment category growth. The good news this quarter is that our gummy business is growing, again. We have had wide retailer acceptance of our new adult beauty line, which hit store shelves in March; so we're off to a good start this year for vitamins.","The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 26% in Q1 year-over-year. A, the category in the U.S. is nearly $100 million, with the potential to be a $300 million category in the U.S. if we match the historical category growth experienced in the UK.","BATISTE is the number one brand in the U.S. with a 17.2% share. BATISTE global net sales will cross $100 million this year, making it the number one dry shampoo brand globally. So it's no surprise that the BATISTE brand is expected to be one of our fastest-growing brands in the future.","Many new products are shipping right now. I've mentioned dual chamber pods, MICROGUARD litter, and the vitamin beauty line. In addition, we have the new GROOVE condom and RIVIERA lubricant by TROJAN, and the new Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit from FIRST RESPONSE.","We feel good about our distribution and we look forward to these products contributing to our organic growth in 2016. Our goal is to continue to focus on consumer insights, leading us to innovative new products to drive share and category growth.","Next up is Rick to give you details on our first-quarter results and the outlook for Q2 and the full year.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. First-quarter reported EPS was $0.86 per share, compared to $0.80 in 2015, up 7.5%. The $0.86 was better than our $0.83 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat; netted in that $0.86 is $0.02, or a 2.5% drag, from currency year-over-year.","Reported revenues were up 4.5% to $849 million. Organic sales were 5.2%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our Consumer business, both Domestic and International.","Now, let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic businesses' organic sales increased by 4.5%, driven by the continued success of our ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent, VITAFUSION gummy vitamins, BATISTE dry shampoo, and ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. We now expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 3% for the Consumer Domestic business.","International organic growth was up an impressive 13.3%. Now, some of that was timing, as orders are a little lumpy in the export business, but underlying growth was very strong at approximately 9%. Here, again, we are raising our expectation for the full year: organic growth from 4% to approximately 5% to 6% for the Consumer International business.","For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales was down 2%, driven by further declines in milk pricing and a difficult comp of 11% growth year ago.","Milk prices have come down 10% in the last 90 days as there is an oversupply globally and, as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been 15%-plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We have lowered our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 1% to 3% to down 2%. This is a headwind that we expect to overcome for the full year. And we still like this business, but we do experience these cycles from time to time.","Turning, now, to gross margin, our reported first quarter gross margin was 44.6%, an 80 basis point increase from year ago. Q1 gross margin benefited from three factors: lower commodities, productivity programs, and the higher margin from acquired businesses. These factors were partially offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix, and higher fixed costs associated with our new vitamin capacity in our York facility.","Moving to marketing, we increased marketing spend by 4.2% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of revenue was consistent with 2015 at 10.9%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.6%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. This was primarily due to incremental amortization from acquisitions and the timing of management stock compensation.","Now, to operating profit; the reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points lower than the prior year. Other income and expense was $6.4 million, largely $7 million of expense related to interest expense. Next is income taxes; our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%. And turning to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter: we generated $178 million of net cash for the first quarter, a $33 million increase from the same quarter year ago.","So in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 5.2% organic, 7.5% EPS growth, which, again, equates to a 10% currency-neutral EPS growth.","Turning to the second quarter outlook, we expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%, and I know a lot of you guys like to look at growth on a two-year stack basis. Remember, for the total company, a year ago Q2 was 5% organic; so on the two-year stack, Q1 and Q2 look pretty similar at approximately 8%. And if we just focus in on the Consumer Domestic business for a minute, the two-year stack, it's going from 6.1% in Q1 to almost 8% in Q2; so a lot of positive momentum continuing on.","We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be flat year-over-year and gross margin to expand in Q2. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.79, compared to an adjusted $0.73 per share year ago, or an 8% increase year-over-year.","And now, turning to the full year, to summarize our thinking, we are raising our expectations for organic sales growth from 3% to 3% to 4%. In February, we called approximately 40 basis points of gross margin expansion and we are pleased to say that now we are calling 70 basis points of gross margin expansion \u2013 75 basis points.","Back in February, this broke out as 70 basis points of help from commodities and productivity, offset by 30 basis points from currency headwinds. The 75 basis points we expect now is 100 basis points from commodities and productivity programs, offset by a 25 basis point drag from currency. We are more optimistic about the stability of commodity pricing across the entire commodity basket for the full year than we were a quarter ago. Our full-year marketing expectation continues to be 12.3% of sales, consistent with 2015 and prior years.","Moving to SG&A, our original expectations were a 10 basis point reduction. We now expect a 25 basis point increase, largely behind R&D, IT, and international sales force investments. Let me give you a little color on these investments: first, investing in R&D projects behind our future product portfolio; second, investing in our international sales force footprint, specifically in high-growth areas of our business to drive future growth; and third, we expect higher ongoing IT infrastructure costs as we implement two new important systems, our spec management system for R&D and our trade management system for sales. We are positioning ourselves well for the future. We continue to expect 50 basis points of operating margin expansion.","Next is income tax; we now expect 34.7% for the full year, so it's a little higher than our previous outlook of 34.5%. We continue to expect $630 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $55 million of CapEx for full-year 2016. This represents 125% free cash flow conversion.","So now, Matt and I will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Bill Chappell. You may proceed, sir.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill. How are you?","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm good. Hey, Matt, maybe just a little bit more on the laundry category trend. This is certainly the highest volume, not just for you, but for the whole category, we've seen in a long time. I mean, it's tough to say if it's just because of pods coming into the category and bringing I mean .... The question is how sustainable is this? How much upside is this? And is it category-wide, or is it also market share related?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, is your question is the category growth driven solely by pods? Because it clearly is not.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. Well, I mean, the question is do you see mid-single-digit growth for the category throughout this year?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, I don't have the crystal ball to say if we're going to have mid-single digit the whole year. That's going to be a function of year-over-year comps, right? But all I can say is if we look at the trends, the trends have been strong with respect to liquid laundry for the last six quarters, and certainly the last four quarters, and no reason to expect that won't continue in the future.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, Rick, just on the SG&A guide, it was \u2013 it came in higher than expected in the first quarter. Is it safe to say a lot of the hires are front-end weighted?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I want to clarify what \u2013 the only head count aspect of the incremental SG&A investment is really around \u2013 hasn't been done, yet. It's going to happen this year, but it's really more to the international footprint business, for the export business and for our Australian sub. So that's the only head count aspect of it. The rest is investments behind incremental projects, new ideas for the future, IT infrastructure costs, not necessarily head count, and we did have some of that in Q1. We expect those to happen throughout the year.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And just to clarify, were these things that were always in the plan or just momentum was so strong starting the year we started to bring some of these in?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I think that's exactly what it was, is momentum is strong. You heard us raise our outlook for gross margin from 40 bps to 70 bps of expansion, and so we're choosing to make some of these investments now.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy. You may proceed.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, first question, guys, the organic sales, clearly very strong in the quarter, but even specifically with respect to the Domestic business it's probably about 200 basis points higher than what we're seeing in the Nielsen data. Can you comment on that? Was there any timing benefit? Can you comment at all on retail or inventory levels? And then, I have a follow-up.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Are you saying it's a big pipe in the first quarter?","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Yes, so it's that, Matt, or are you seeing better growth in non-scan channels, like at Costco, as an example?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, well, obviously, Costco is an important customer for us, both on the vitamin side and also the laundry side. So, it is true the non-measured channels do influence our results.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Just two more quickly for Rick or for you, Matt. What gets you to the higher end of the range for the balance of the year as you look out? How much of that is laundry, litter, vitamins? Maybe a little bit of commentary there would help. And then the other one, you guys generally comment on the M&A pipeline, what you're seeing and efforts there. So those two follow-ups will do it for me. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, well, one of the reasons I chose to speak about the categories upfront, Kevin, is because laundry, litter, vitamins, and, more recently, the dry shampoo categories are catalysts to the Company, and we started the year with growth in all those categories and consumption growth as well. So that bodes well for us for the rest of the year; so that definitely influences our thinking on our success of the Domestic business in 2016. And the other piece of our full-year raise is, obviously, International. International had a rocking first quarter, and so we're taking up their number on a full-year basis as well.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","The M&A piece, Matt?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Say again?","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","The M&A pipeline? Yes.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","M&A, well, as we've said in the past, there's rarely a week when we're not looking at some transaction, but we don't go any further than that in our commentary. We're always looking, diligencing something, but we're pretty fussy about what we'll buy.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Schmitz. You may proceed, sir.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Guys, good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you talk about the gross margin progression? Because the natural flow of the business, and if you look at what some of the other folks in laundry have done, just given the year-over-year decline in a lot of commodity costs, the gross margin should naturally be a lot higher. And, obviously, you beat your guidance and raised it for the full year, but what is offsetting that natural flow through of what you would expect, given this commodity and category growth environment?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bill, I think that's a fair question. We talked about it a little bit on our Analyst Day and we talked through some of the headwinds, like transactional currency. But I'd say, overall, we're really pleased with our gross margin expansion. We just talked about how we're going from 40 basis points to 75 basis points, so essentially we're doubling it; and that entire doubling of it is largely commodities. I think we feel more comfortable with that full-year outlook of commodities.","So, do we have one-offs every now and then on write-offs and whatnot that burden gross margin? Sure, but overall, in general, we're really happy about doubling our gross margin outlook, pretty much, and if commodities continue to stay where they're at or improve, we'll probably be talking about it again.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, I know this is a small one and maybe it's a little nitpicky, but on this Spencer Forrest acquisition, I think you spent $175 million for $30 million of sales. Is there this massive growth trajectory of the business? Is that why you paid such a high multiple of sales?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think we probably got similar questions like that when we bought BATISTE back in 2011. The way to think about that, Bill, is that the hair thinning category is about a $240 million category. That's mostly dominated by topicals, brands like Rogaine. And our point of view is that hair thinning can also be addressed with hair fibers, and we bought a product that we think is going to have significant growth in future because it addresses the problem in a cosmetic fashion and not with chemicals.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, and then maybe just back to that gross margin thing very quickly because, on my math, you should do 300 basis points of gross margin expansion this year. But this quarter, was there a purchase accounting step up or anything like that that impacted the gross margin from this TOPPIK deal?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. No, there's not. And we can take it off-line at some point, but there is no way that we had the exposure from the commodities to make it a 300 basis point move. We just don't have that type of volatility.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thanks so much.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Bill.","Operator","And our next question comes from Caroline Levy. You may proceed.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks so much. I wanted to talk about your new products. You went through some stuff pretty quickly, but can you elaborate on some of the major ideas and why you think that this is going to keep the momentum strong, and if you think your market share gains can continue?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've been the leader in the litter category for many years, now. If you remember when we spoke downtown in February, we showed a chart that showed our innovations over the past three years or four years. So we've clearly been the catalyst for that category, and we have a winner again this year with the MICROGUARD product. So we're driving growth in the category, which is a big category, and we're taking share. And we generally have a big new idea every year, so we think we can continue that in the future.","With respect to laundry, as I said earlier, while ARM & HAMMER has been quite a powerhouse for us for a long time, the new product this year \u2013 one of them, is the BioEnzyme product, which has the EPA Safer Choice label, which is becoming more meaningful to all shoppers. So we think that's a nice new variant for us that's going to help us continue to grow the franchise.","Some of the other things I mentioned, vitamins, what we did was we decided to shrink-wrap our products, so we got beautiful new packaging, which obviously speaks out or pops on shelf; and we think that is going to be a winner for us this year as well.","Continuing down the line, in the TROJAN, TROJAN RIVIERA, so this is \u2013 you may recall this is a lubricant that can be used in the shower. So that's another consumer insight that we think is going to help expand the share for TROJAN. And as you know, TROJAN's share continues to grow. We're up slightly year-over-year, a little over 76% share.","And FIRST RESPONSE, again, is the number one brand in pregnancy test kits, and we're the first people to come out to try a Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit. So that's our \u2013 what we're trying to do there is test and learn in what we call the Internet of Things.","So we have a very robust new product development process. We're very focused on consumer insights and that does lead us to really cool ideas with respect to new products, and we've got a nice pipeline for 2017 and 2018. So that gives us confidence that we continue to grow the top-line organically.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","That's great. And if I just may ask how much the TOPPIK should \u2013 TOPPIK acquisition should continue to contribute? Is it about a percentage point to growth through the balance of the year?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, remember, that's a small business. It's about $30 million in total, right, so...","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. So, yes, about 1% for the full year on a reported basis.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","On a reported basis, yeah.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. And then, just lastly on buybacks, you actually were well ahead of what we expected in the first quarter at $200 million. The longer it takes for you to find a big acquisition can we expect a higher run rate on buybacks, now, perhaps?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Caroline, I think we were right on our expectations for a buyback. We said we were going to do around $300 million this year of buybacks, and we did $100 million in December. We did about $200 million in February, and if you look at our past practice, we typically get ahead of our full-year buyback in Q1. So $300 million is right on target. We feel good about that number. I think, as you've seen us in the past, if we go many, many, many years without doing an acquisition and we have the cash build up on the balance sheet, then we always look back and say how do we return that to shareholders.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","So you could step it up in the fourth quarter, but don't expect much for the balance of the year, probably?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would say that $300 million is our sweet spot for this year as of now.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Altobello. You may proceed.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. First question on the categories, obviously getting better, you did mention back in February that that could be potential upside to guidance. Is there any larger takeaway on the broader consumer in the U.S. from the fact that 11 of your 15 categories were up?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a good question, Joe. So we know everybody has their own crystal ball about the economy and we do look at it the same way; so we always monitor those 15 categories. So having 11 of the 15 up is a very good sign, and the four that weren't up are some of the \u2013 at least three of them are some of the smaller categories. So I would say, yes, that is a good sign. Of course, you have to temper that by \u2013 if you look at some of the big houses, most big banks, more recently, have reduced the GDP outlook for the U.S. this year to 1.5%; so, obviously there is some pessimism out there. The credit card debt is going up. Some people speculate that fuel savings are going to healthcare costs. So there's definitely a couple different camps out there with respect to the economy.","For our part, we do look at these categories and we see a lot of strength in them, so we don't think that's going to turn around that quickly. We think it should stay strong for the rest of the year.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And how are retailers managing inventories? Are they getting a little bit more \u2013 or, actually, less conservative, given that?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I wouldn't say that. I think the retailers are no different than any of the CPG companies and everybody looks at working capital very closely. So, no, I wouldn't say there would be any change in practice there.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, you mentioned that kids gummies, the category, was down 8%; just curious what drove that.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the kids gummy section has been trending down for more than just this quarter, for a while. And the speculation around that is that, once upon a time, before the advent of adult gummies, that adults took kids gummies, and that with a lot of adult gummies now coming on shelf, adults are using the adult gummies and not the kids. So that's why I said earlier is that our focus is on adults. Kids is a very mature category. Even when we bought the business, if you looked at vitamins, two-thirds of all the vitamins that children took in the U.S. were gummies. So it was already saturated, and so there's some migration from kids to adults.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And one last one, I have to ask on OXICLEAN laundry detergent. It looks like the shares were down, again, a little bit this quarter. What's your thinking there, maybe plans for that brand going forward in that category?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, look, it's no secret that you have a new entrant into high-end laundry detergent last year with Henkel's Persil brand. And they went to Walmart and Amazon, and then at the end of the year, and now, they're expanding and doing a lot of couponing, et cetera. So, there is \u2013 the activity is very fierce right now with respect to couponing from those guys. So, obviously, we would be a victim of some of that. So we lost some share, but, as I said in my earlier remarks, you are right. In the quarter, we did lose 20 basis points of share. If you look the more recent week, we're back to a one share; but it's sort of a steady state, one share right now, and we're really trying to crack the code here and figure out how to grow that brand. But we are still committed to it.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gere. You may proceed.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions; one, I guess, obviously, every few years one of your big competitors finds some cost-cutting initiatives in place and everybody fears about what could happen to some of the categories. And laundry, in particular, the category seems to be strong, so you talked a little bit about Persil and a little bit of the couponing there. Is there anything on the front from that big competitor right now that they may go after some of the shares that they've seen either at the high end or even push more behind their value brand just to get greater growth?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","No, Jason, I don't have any intelligence, other than what you see in the marketplace today, that they're big push is in the high end with Persil, pretty aggressive claims. And there is nothing more to report from that competitor.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, but how about the other competitor, the bigger one, the big dog? I'm talking about just as they're pushing a little bit more with Simply Clean or even at \u2013 as they've seen that you've made the foray into the pods, just wondering if there's any intel there? It seems like you guys feel pretty comfortable about how this year is playing out, but what does history teach you?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, maybe it'll help you if I comment just on the amount sold on deal in laundry last year versus this year. So last year first quarter, it was 36% for the category, and this year first quarter, it's 35%; so not much of a change year-over-year. If you're talking about what new innovations they have, I think we all know that they have a similar product to our BioEnzyme that they just launched; but I don't have any other color other than that.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. No, that's good. And then the other question, just going back to some of the investments on the international sales force, and I know you talked a lot more about the export business, but just curious your thoughts. You've been predominantly a domestic business, with some of the categories being able to carry over to your \u2013 more your North American international counterparts, Mexico, Canada, et cetera. But with this expansion in international, does it change your thinking about the portfolio you have getting greater expansion, whether in new markets or even with expanding some of the categories that you're in domestically? So just wondering if we should read into anything there.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, when we talk about the International division, we have our countries, so we have six primary countries, and then we have an export business. And we have found that we've had a lot of success with our products in a lot of countries other than those six countries that I mentioned where we have subsidiaries. And we've got a terrific leadership team in the export business, and they've been driving a lot of growth. And when you have people that are successful like that and they have plans to execute to drive that growth, we said we're going to add the head count. And you know how stingy we are around here about adding heads.","So we're going to invest behind these guys in export, and we're also doing the same in the Specialty Products Division. We bought a business a year ago, a small business, to add to our animal productivity business, and, likewise, we have the ability to go international with some of those products as well. This is both in dairy and in poultry. So we're going to invest for the future and, because we had a rocking first quarter and things are looking up for the year, we said, hey, this is a good time to reinvest.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks for the color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Powers. You may proceed.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. A follow-up on domestic growth trending above tracked channels. I know it's a small base, but how much of that was from strength in e-commerce? And what, if anything, are you guys doing differently in that area as online demand accelerates?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a good question. Most CPG companies have their online sales between 1% and 3%, and when I say 1% \u2013 that range would include all the usual suspects, the amazon.com, walmart.com, target.com, et cetera, et cetera. So, I would say most CPG companies are in the early innings with respect to selling product online. Now, of course, that can change very quickly. For our part \u2013 when I say change very quickly, it's not going to go to 5% or 10% in just a couple years, but it will change over time. So we've decided that we want to get really good at that, so it's one of our focuses right now. It did not \u2013 was not a big contributor, I would say, to the first quarter results, but we are going to have higher online sales this year, year-over-year, by a meaningful percentage year-over-year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","And is \u2013 does it have anything to do \u2013 are any of the investments you're making incrementally this year in SG&A, are any of them related to e-commerce capabilities?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah, exactly. We've hired a couple people, and you may have seen recently the Dash Buttons for Amazon. So there are six Dash Buttons out there: TROJAN, BATISTE, VITAFUSION, L'IL CRITTERS, OXICLEAN, and ARM & HAMMER Litter. So I hope everybody on the call is getting a couple of those buttons for their refrigerators.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","There you go. Okay. Great. Thanks, and I guess \u2013 it's really small, I know, but can you just quantify, Rick, the deal amortization in the quarter and what you just \u2013 the number, incremental amortization year-over-year for the full year? Thanks.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would say that in Q1 the TOPPIK acquisition had a really high SG&A rate, it was probably around 15%, and part of that is amortization, part of that's transition costs. So all-in, it was around 40 basis points to the quarter.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. You may proceed.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Just first, Rick, to follow up on that, that was the first quarter impact from the higher SG&A, but going forward, what would be the amortization because the transition cost would obviously go away?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, it's probably about half of that.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right, thanks. And then, also, just in terms of the incremental spending overall, Matt, you said it yourself. You guys are stingy and incredible cost control over the years, so I just found it striking that you found this much that you want to put money back into. So are these areas that \u2013 I know you said it was \u2013 you had the flex, but why didn't you go after them before? What does it add incrementally to the growth potential that you wouldn't have had without the investment? I just think it's interesting, given how tight you've been with investment over time, the decision to put so much back in.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, Lauren, we wouldn't quantify our business model with respect to how many people did we or are we adding, and what's the sales and profits associated with that. The point is that has been a focus for us, the export business. Even before we made this decision, we had hired even stronger people there. So this is just another increment on top of that increment.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and let me put a little bit of context behind it, too. We're talking about a move of going from down 10 basis points in SG&A to up 25 basis points. That's around $11 million or $12 million, right? We're adding, whatever, $3 million or so from incremental R&D projects, not head count, just more opportunities for the future, more NPD, more resources to work on different things. There's a couple million dollars for the head count for the International business and the export business, and there's a few million dollars for higher IT infrastructure costs. So it's not like we're taking a huge dollar amount and going and investing in head count. I just want to be clear on that.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And on the International, what would it be \u2013 what would be the decision point for you guys to move from an export model to being \u2013 establishing local operations and running it like more of an affiliate model?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a really good question, and to do something like that, you'd have to have one of your brands really have enough critical mass so that you could enter that market. And there are a couple of countries we're looking at right now, but we wouldn't disclose that.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason English. You may proceed.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jason.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Congrats on the solid start to the year.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","(39:12).","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to come back and rehash some of the questions that have already been asked. First, to Bill Schmitz' question on gross margins, 300 basis points that he gets to mathematically seems pretty optimistic, but I agree with his general premise that mathematically it's not that hard to get well above where you're guiding to. So a couple of questions just to help us understand this; first, commodities, is there something to consider in terms of your hedge positions for last year, this year, et cetera, that may cause your benefit or lack thereof to be greater or worse than what we'd see in spot markets? And then, secondly, the leakage on the fixed-cost absorption for the new vitamin plant, I appreciate that that's here to stay for a while, but you're soon going to start to lap the startup expenses. Do those two effectively wash, or our expectation was that you could actually get a surplus, that the startup costs were greater than the fixed-cost de-leverage you're getting now?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. So I'll take the commodity question first. So we had said previously, and it's still the case, that, in general, resin was down 10%, surfactants were down 20%, paper was relatively flat. You guys know what oil and diesel are doing, and those are favorable year-over-year as well.","I think, in general, we do have some hedges out there. We went into the year with about 30% hedged, which is really our lowest level in quite a few years because we thought we should float most of the market. We do have a couple hedges on surfactants, so maybe we're not getting the entire spot market benefit, but, in general, 300 basis points is not realistic for us at all. So we do have that as a tailwind, in general, from commodities.","Fixed costs for vitamins; now remember, we told you guys this was a 75% increase in capacity, so a $300 million business becomes $525 million. It's going to take some time to really grow into those fixed overheads. And you're right, we had startup costs last year, but those fixed overheads are more in totality than the startup costs were a year ago.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. That's helpful. And then, back to the laundry category growth, we see the lower promotional activity. We see some of the mix-up that's happening in the category. But when we do our best to try to get to a load equivalent volume, we're seeing volume on a load equivalized basis growing north of 3%, which is a bit of a head-scratcher, right, because it's hard to imagine that people have just decided \u2013 or have more dirty clothes or are doing more laundry. Any views on what's driving that volumetric growth from a load equivalized perspective?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think I have to agree with you, Jason, that it's a head-scratcher. I could say in the past at times we think sometimes the information that we use on volume, you have to take with a grain of salt because of all the different sizes within the category. If you think about wash loads, so if you're saying there's a lot more wash loads, it's illogical to think that there's 3% or 4% more wash loads being done with population growth only 1.5%.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Do you...","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jason, the other thing there is...","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, go ahead.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...we do see trends. There's a certain percentage of the category that does mix pods and liquid laundry, so that might throw off your wash load metrics as well.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, definitely, definitely. Okay, cool. Well, I'll just pass it on. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Olivia Tong. You may proceed.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just one for me is around a little bit more about gross margin and more the gross to net spend that you guys do, because there has been a lot of talk this quarter amongst other HBC companies about that line item. So, first, how much is your spend in that area and how has that been trending?","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we don't want to go into the details between gross to net and all of our trade spending, Olivia. I would say we continue to watch the trade spending, just like we do every item in the P&L; and Matt has given you context on laundry. That's a good indicator, right? Amount sold on deal for laundry a year ago was 36%. Now it's 35%. For litter, it was 24% a year ago. Now it's 22%. Vitamins is another big category for us, and that was 39% a year ago and it's 39% this year. So there's a little context.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jon Andersen. You may proceed.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jon.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Just two quick ones for me. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your, I guess, latest power brand, BATISTE, and provide some context around the opportunity in the U.S. I think dry shampoo is a bigger part of the shampoo category in the UK, but could you give us maybe some metrics there so we can try and understand the opportunity that lies ahead here in the U.S.?","And then, the second question is just an update on the potential for another round of compaction in liquid laundry. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, as far as the context for the BATISTE opportunity is look at the UK. The UK, round numbers, has about 60 million people, and it has \u2013 the category there is about $60 million. So you just do the quick math, you have 335 million people in the U.S. So you've got five times the population, so we'd say, well, you've got an opportunity for five times the category size; that would be $60 million becomes $300 million here. So that really is the math behind the thinking that this could be a much bigger category.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","And then, on compaction in laundry?","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah as far as compaction, yeah, well, it's nothing to report on compaction. I think the last time that anything was said publicly, Walmart was thinking about the end of 2017 or early 2018; but there's no discussion about that right now.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good \u2013 congrats on the good start.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon.","Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time.","Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining us."],"5092":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call May  2, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Matt Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Rick Dierker - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Erica Eiler - Oppenheimer","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank","Steve Strycula - UBS","Cody Ross - Goldman Sachs","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Operator","Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead sir.","Matt Farrell","Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a few comments on the quarter, then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. When Rick is finished, we'll open up the call for questions.","Q1 was an outstanding quarter for our company as we saw strong organic sales growth and gross margin expansion. Q1 reported sales grew 3.8%. Organic sales growth was 4.5%, which exceeded our outlook of 3.5% to 4%. Earnings per share was $0.70 which exceeded our outlook by $0.04.","In the U.S., organic sales grew 4.5% with volume growth and positive price. Our categories are growing and our market shares are healthy. 10 of our 14 domestic categories grew during the quarter. And beyond category growth, our share results were solid with eight out of 11 power brands growing share.","We continue to have success in the online class of trade, global consumer online sales continues to grow rapidly, and we expect it to exceed 8% of our sales in 2019. Our international consumer business delivered another terrific quarter with 8.5% organic growth. International is a growth driver and a bright spot for Church & Dwight. Unlike many of our peers, Canada, Germany, and our global markets group, which we formally refer to as export, had particularly strong quarters. Our new partnership with Shanghai Jahwa is off to a good start and it is clear that the investments that we've made in our international business continue to pay off.","Now, turning to Specialty Products, Q1 was a challenging quarter for us with a 4.2% decline in organic sales. We are seeing lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers who continue to be hurt by low milk prices. So, in the short-term, we are less optimistic about a sales recovery in 2019. However, we still feel good about our long-term 5% organic sales algorithm as a result of our acquisitions of businesses serving other species like poultry, cattle, and swine.","Now, let's go back to the U.S. business for a moment and call out a couple of the bright lights in the quarter. In household, the laundry category grew 1.7%. ARM & HAMMER laundry consumption was up 8.2% and gained 0.7 share points.","As anticipated the promotional environment moderated a bit in Q1. We reduced ARM & HAMMER laundry percentage sold on promotion by 110 basis points, while maintaining growth and we plan to reduce promotional levels more in the coming quarters.","Over in personal care, BATISTE continued to gain share with a 28% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category nearly doubling the category growth of 15%. BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo for the 13th consecutive quarter.","Now, let's have an update on pricing. Late last year, we raised price in several of our household categories in the high single-digit range. The impact on volumes so far has been better than expected. Over the last few months, we have had additional conversations with our retail partners regarding price increases in personal care category such as dry shampoo and condoms. These products are currently shipping with the new pricing.","And finally we closed the FLAWLESS acquisition yesterday. We're excited to own the market leader in women's electric hair removal products. FLAWLESS is a fast-growing brand which complements our specialty hair care business. We expect it to contribute to our long-term growth both domestically and internationally and Rick will comment more on the impact of FLAWLESS to our 2019 outlook in a moment.","So, in conclusion, we had a terrific quarter. We're feeling really good about the rest of the year and our evergreen business model is helping.","Next up is Rick to give you details on the first quarter and the outlook for Q2 and the full year.","Rick Dierker","Thank you, Matt and good morning everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter EPS was $0.70 per share compared to $0.63 in 2018, up 11%. The $0.70 was better than our $0.66 outlook, primarily due to higher gross margin.","Reported revenue were up -- was up 3.8%. Organic sales were up 4.5% exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 3.5% to 4%. The organic sales beat was driven by our global consumer growth of 5.2%. We're extremely pleased with our results. This is the third consecutive quarter of global consumer product growth in excess of 5%.","Now, let's review the segments. First Consumer Domestic, organic sales increased by 4.5% due to higher volume and positive price and product mix, as we see the benefit of our price increases flowing through.","Growth was led by ARM & HAMMER liquid, unit dose laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter, TROJAN condoms, XTRA liquid laundry detergent, L\u2019IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, and BATISTE dry shampoo. ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent continues to grow sales and gain share while decreasing the amount sold on promotion.","International organic growth was up 8.5% driven largely by FEMFRESH BATISTE STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent in the global markets group. ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and liquid laundry detergent in Canada, BATISTE in Germany, and WATERPIK in several countries. For our Specialty Products Division, our organic sales declined 4.2%. Although demand for our products continues to grow in the poultry industry, demand in the dairy industry continues to be challenged.","Turning now to gross margin, our first quarter gross margin was 45.1%, a 20 basis point increase from a year ago due to price increases, volume growth, and productivity programs, partially offset by higher commodity and manufacturing costs. This exceeded our expectations, and you will hear later that we are raising the full year gross margin outlook.","Moving now to marketing, marketing was down $1.8 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 9.4%, largely due to timing. But as you heard from Matt, both our share performance and net sales are strong. For SG&A, Q1 SG&A decreased 50 basis points year-over-year.","And net operating profit -- the operating margin for the quarter was 23.1%. This represents 120 basis point increased over Q1, 2018. Other expense all in was $17.4 million, primarily driven by interest expense. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 21.9% compared to 21.4% in 2018, an increase of 50 basis points.","And now to cash, for the first three months of 2019, net cash from operating activities was $137.6 million, a $17.6 million decrease from the prior year, as higher cash earnings were more than offset by an increase in working capital, that's largely timing-related.","I'd like to take a minute and talk about our FLAWLESS acquisition and the accounting treatment. As you know, typically when we do deals, we buy the inventory on day 1. Based on the agreement, FLAWLESS will continue to operate the business during the transition period with their systems, which will last approximately four months.","During this period, operating results will be recorded in the company's net sales line, impacting many of our metrics as we detailed in the earnings release. For the remaining four months, FLAWLESS results will be consolidated within specific P&L line items. So the total FLAWLESS impact on the company is, net sales is expected to increase by 200 basis points; gross margin increases by 20 basis points; marketing decreases by 10 basis points; and SG&A increases by 50 basis points.","From a cash perspective, the expected increase in cash earnings 4% accretion is offset by a one-time inventory purchase at the end of the transition period and a onetime working capital build, which will be approximately $30 million in total.","As a result, the full year effect of the acquisition on 2019 operating cash flow is neutral. Additionally, as previously discussed, there will be quarterly adjustments to the FLAWLESS earn-out, which will impact the P&L. These will be excluded from our adjusted results, but will impact the reported numbers.","Now turning to the second quarter outlook, we expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 3.5%. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.52, 6% increase over last year's quarter. And now for the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to be approximately 3.5%. In terms of organic outlook by division, we now expect 3% for the domestic business, 7% from international and flat for SPD.","We now expect reported sales growth of approximately 5% to 6%. We now expect full year gross margin to be up 50 basis points. This represents a 40 basis point increase from our previous guidance of plus 10.","Half of the increase is driven by the previously discussed FLAWLESS impact, and the other half is a combination of Q1 gross margin, coming in better as well as the additional pricing actions, which will impact the second half of the year.","While we were pleased to see first quarter gross margins above prior year, we still anticipate the impact of commodities, transportation and manufacturing cost to negatively impact gross margin. One example of this is surfactants where we saw a market pricing below prior year in Q1 with a forecast for double-digit increases for the balance of the year. As a result of the amortization and transition expenses related to the FLAWLESS acquisition, SG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be approximately 13.8%.","We continue to expect 2019 adjusted EPS range of $2.43 to $2.47 per share or adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 9%. And as we discussed a month ago the FLAWLESS impact to EPS in 2019 is neutral. The gross margin expansion on the base business is being offset by a reduction on our share buyback activity as we stated we would do with a larger acquisition.","And with that Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Erica Eiler","Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So I actually had wanted to touch on the promotional backdrop. I was just curious if you could elaborate a little bit more about what you're seeing right now on the promotional front? And do you still expect promotion activity to abate further this year?","Matt Farrell","Okay. In thinking about the promotional environment we're generally talking about household categories. So if you look at the laundry category and look at what the percentage sold on deal was year-over-year, it was down about 340 basis points. So it went from like 40.3 down to 36.9, so it's quite a drop. So the average for the category is 36.9.","Where we right now for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry is 34%. So we were down 100 basis points year-over-year. So I -- it's quite a move down year-over-year, so I would expect that to be sustained for the rest of the year. And as I said in my opening remarks we expect also to reduce more in the next three quarters.","The other category to pay attention to is litter. So on the litter category, you've Tidy Cats you've Clorox and Church & Dwight and all of those brands are down year-over-year as a percentage sold on deal. So the category is down 400 basis points. It went from 21.9 to 17.7. So down quite a bit.","So as expected all -- it seems all the manufacturers have pulled back quite a bit on promotions. Recall that last year that everybody has experienced commodity increases and transportation increases big jump from 2017 going to 2018, 2018 going to 2019 not as bad, but still up. So this behavior is consistent with the ability of the suppliers to offset those cost increases.","Erica Eiler","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Bill Chappell","Thanks good morning. Could you talk a little bit just about what you're seeing on the commodity front? We've heard some kind of improvement on freight logistics. I mean though I know you still have some kind of lagging inflation that's going to hit you. I mean is the outlook getting any better there? Or is it pretty status quo?","Rick Dierker","This is Rick. Hey Bill. I would say that transportation as an example status quo. I think we said mid single digit increases for us last time we talked back in February and that's still our expectation.","Like we've touched on many times we are largely hedged about 75% hedged for a lot of our commodities. That piece that does float, we have some capability in Q1, right? And I think I alluded to in my remarks that ethylene as an example was actually down year-over-year in Q1.","Now the forecast has it going up in Q2, Q3 and Q4. But so far April looks lot like Q1. So I think we're optimistic that for the first time in a long time commodities were actually abating.","Bill Chappell","Got it. And just a second question. Trying to understand the liquid laundry environment, I mean are you still seeing maybe you expect it to abate throughout the year in terms of promotional levels? Do you expect -- I mean there's certainly one player in Europe that kind of comes back time and time again. So I'm just trying to understand how long you think this lasts?","Matt Farrell","Yes. Look in the first quarter even the company you referred to that's in Europe was down sold on deal. We can't predict what the competition is going to do, but this isn't just one quarter Bill. We've kind of started to see this trend in the second half of 2018 that's continued into 2019. So it's not obvious that, that is just going to turn around very quickly.","Bill Chappell","Okay. And then last one for me. Just I'm actually surprised that litter is everybody is down on promotion, because it seems to be a kind of a major battlefront for all the players with new introductions in pricing, and promotion, and advertising. Is that starting to abate?","Matt Farrell","When you have all these price increases you also have to keep in mind that people aren't going to dealing it back, right? So it's somewhat consistent that you're not going to see as much sold on deal. People want to see the price increases take hold and be able to drop it down to gross profit.","Bill Chappell","Got it. But you're not seeing any real change in the competitive environment on litter?","Matt Farrell","No. No, we're not.","Bill Chappell","Okay. Thanks so much.","Matt Farrell","All right. Okay, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Steve Powers","Yes. Hey, great. So I missed some of the statistics that you opened with Matt on the number of categories and brands that are growing or gaining share. Maybe just run through those again briefly, and just talk about some of the categories or brands that aren't in the green? Obviously, great results overall. But are there any surprises or disappointments that you tied at the category brand level? And if so, are they kind of according to plan more or less? Or are there pockets where you could actually see incremental improvement?","Matt Farrell","Yes. I think that the one day, I'm not going to get that question is when it's 14 out of 14, they're up.","Steve Powers","Correct.","Matt Farrell","It was 10 out of 14 the categories were up in the first quarter. Some of the categories that are struggling would be like condoms, for example. There are secular reasons for that for the last couple of years, because there are alternative contraceptives to condoms including Plan B and intrauterine devices, et cetera.","Kids is down as well year-over-year, the category. I'd say those are -- that's also -- you could argue that that may be also related to birth rates. But I'd say on the sexual health side of the house is where we see some weakness. So that's probably where I would spend most of my time.","Steve Powers","Okay.","Matt Farrell","As far as the shares go\u2026","Steve Powers","Yes.","Matt Farrell","\u2026our power brands eight out of 11 grew share in the quarter. So, it\u2019s spectacular. Last year we had seven out of 11 on a full year basis. So we feel great about the strength of the brands.","Steve Powers","Okay. Cool. And then you'd spent a lot of time at the Investor Day on that More Power to You campaign. Can you just talk a little bit about metrics measurements that you're tracking against that campaign? And just how they are -- how you're assessing the ROI there? And how that ROI is trending versus what your expectations were?","Matt Farrell","Yes. Well, think of it this way, Steve. We're just turning that campaign on right now. As I said, when we're down at the Stock Exchange that is going to be a multi-year program.","I really think we've hit upon something that resonates with consumers. You're going to start seeing it hit in the next couple of months both on television as well as in print and digital as well, but this is something that we think is going to be a big boost for us, because ARM & HAMMER is across so many different categories.","So it's laundry. It's litter. It's toothpaste, underarm deodorant. It's a phenomenal brand, because it trades in so many different categories. So this campaign is going to halo all of those categories. So hope to give you an update on that in future quarters to let you know how it's going, but it's only just kicking off right now.","Rick Dierker","Yes. And I would just add Steve, this is Rick, that it's always encouraging that when we're spending our lowest quarter of the year in terms of marketing spend to have the results that we just had. So that's another good indication.","Steve Powers","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First would be on the personal care segment. I believe last quarter WATERPIK drove about 100% of the organic sales growth. Is that the case again in the first quarter of this year?","Rick Dierker","No. It's not.","Steve Strycula","Okay. So some of the other business did they get sequentially better? Would you mind commenting?","And the second piece would be, should we think about since you're calling out surfactant costs being escalating this quarter, is that open negotiations for another round of price increases there? Thank you.","Rick Dierker","Yes. So, really we did have some strength in a couple of different personal care areas. I quoted L\u2019IL CRITTERS as an example. I quoted BATISTE dry shampoo in the release. So those are kind of leading the way from a PC growth perspective. I know WATERPIK was slightly positive, but the price increases and volumes kind of offset.","Your second question was on surfactants and another round of price increasing. Well surfactants were actually \u2013 like I said ethylene was actually down year-over-year in the quarter. It's expected to be up in Q2, Q3, Q4 consistent to how it was three months ago when we gave our outlook. And we said, many times that we're not going to lead with any type of price increases in that laundry category. But what you're seeing in the laundry category is promotions being peeled back and you're seeing coupon reductions kind of what Matt was alluding to before.","Steve Strycula","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Cody Ross","Good morning. This is actually Cody Ross on for Jason English, this morning. Thank you for taking our question. Sticking with the household products segment. This segment's revenue acceleration was exceptional this period even in the wake of some of your competitors announcing increased investment in your product categories. What do you think is driving your growth in liquid laundry? Why do you think you've been able to take market share? And given your recent market share gains are you expecting any step-up in competitive activity as the year progresses?","Matt Farrell","Yeah. We've talked about this many times before about the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent. You have to keep in mind that ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry is a value detergent. It's on the high end of the scale but it is a value detergent. And the brands that we compete against are Purex and Sun others and they are unadvertised brands. So we have a distinct advantage in the way we compete in that. Our brand has a lot of brand equity and those resonate with the consumer.","Now, we've been growing the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent year-over-year for years. And this is \u2013 and we did \u2013 again, we grew this quarter quite a bit at the same time that we reduced our promotional spend year-over-year. So it's \u2013 and behind that we have the More Power To You campaign coming, which is also going to help us. So I think this is largely due to brand equity more than it has to do with promotions.","Cody Ross","Great. Thank you. And just to juxtapose that to your Personal care segment. This segment growth decelerated quite significantly despite the strength that you guys called out in BATISTE and WATERPIK. Is this all really your condoms slowdown? Or what else have you seen in the market in this segment that has caused the slowdown? Thank you.","Rich Dierker","Yeah, it's really two things. I think Matt alluded to the sexual health businesses being a slower grower. And then it's also our WATERPIK business isn't \u2013 we took a bit price increase and so volume elasticity has happened. And so the net result is the WATERPIK business has grown a little slower. So we think that's kind of transitory as the price increase takes hold, but that's what happened in Q1.","Cody Ross","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your gross margins they inflected positive in the quarter which is great. So hoping you guys could talk through your outlook for gross margins for the rest of the year and if any of the key drivers have changed here and just really now wondering if your guidance for gross margin could actually end up being conservative. Do you see more upside now?","Rich Dierker","Well, we hope so Bonnie. Remember, our outlook for gross margin when we met back in February for the full year was plus 10 basis points. And the detail of that back in February was, we were counting on plus 125 from price\/volume mix, right? Largely as we're getting these price increases through on at that time 30% of the portfolio. We said we were going to have 100 basis points of improvement from productivity. We said we were going to have minus 190 for inflation and then minus 25 for the tariff. That's how we got to the plus 10 back in February.","Now I'd say, there is really two small changes in our outlook. The base business, we would say is plus 30 basis points now not plus 10, plus 30 so the 20 bps of a change, 10 comes from better price\/mix and volume and then 10 comes from a little bit lower inflation. So that's how you get to plus 30 and then the other plus 20 is really from the acquisition impact and the transition accounting. So I think we're off to a great start. We feel really good about it. We have plus 20 in the first quarter. We think we will be down slightly in the second quarter, first half is flat. Second half is probably up 100. So that's how we get to our 50.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question. I know it's a small business for you guys, but hoping you could drill down a little further on the pressures you're seeing in specialty products and then maybe what changes you're making if any to deal with the headwinds. And you mentioned, you don't expect much recovery, but you're going to be lapping easier comps in that business. So just kind of trying to understand if we should expect continued inorganic sales declines for the remainder of the year? Or you expect some kind of recovery possibly Q4? Thanks.","Matt Farrell","Yes. Just a little bit of color on the dairy market. So dairy price, the dairy industry is influenced by the price of milk. So if you look at class three milk 2018, it was pretty low. It was $14.60 per hundred weight, that's how it's sold 100 pounds. Q1 was even less than that it was $14.30. So dairy farmers are definitely struggling. If you look at last year, I mean 2017 going to 2018 there was a 7% drop in the number of licensed dairy farms in the U.S. The number of cows didn't decline so much they only declined 1%. So all those cows got distributed around to those other dairy farms, but that was the single largest drop recorded by the USDA. So obviously tough going right now for the dairy industry.","What we've been doing is, we've been diversifying away from dairy over for the past three years. So last year what we said was that about 25% of our Specialty Products sales I'll narrow that sales of our animal productivity business 25% was for nondairy. So absent that we would have an even greater difficulty. If you went back three years 2015, 100% of our animal productivity business was dairy.","So it is a worry for us obviously. But we think long-term and we know this is a cyclical business, so it does come back eventually. But in the meantime, we continue to expand the businesses that are directed towards cattle swine and poultry. For a full year -- on a full year basis, we started out saying I think we said 9% organic growth. That is not going to happen. I think it's going to be flat for the full year for Specialty Products business.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you.","Matt Farrell","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to talk a little bit about pricing again. Clearly, you're having very good flow-through and like you commented volumes have held in very, very well. I was just curious about I guess your perspective on some of the gross margin pressures that retailers are facing? And what that may mean in terms of sustainability in terms of pricing from an industry standpoint, not just Church specific. But given it's gone so nicely for you, I was just curious kind of how that's going? What you're seeing day-to-day? Retailers many are opting to absorb the price increases that you guys are putting through on a cost justified basis. But I just worry about sustainability for the industry. So anything you could offer there would be really helpful? Thanks.","Rick Dierker","Yes. Look I think we all know that retailers are challenged and oftentimes retailers have to turn to suppliers for some help with respect to their profitability. And different brands are in a better position to deal with those asks than others. And the reason we focus on having a number one and number two brands is so that when that conversation takes place that we can work -- we actually have something to bring to the party. And so if the retailer should say I need x then we might say hey, we need an endcap, we need to be moved up to eye level.","When you're a number one and number two brand, you can have those conversations with the retailers. When you are the number three, four and five brand that's far more difficult. So I think those are the brands that are going to be far more at risk than the brands that are number one and number two. But what you described Lauren is something we've been dealing with for the last several years. You might say, okay it's going to become more acute now, if you raise price. But you would expect that some -- the penny profit for the retailer is also going to go up as well. So all of that profit is not winding up in our pockets.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. All right. Great. And then just one more thing was on the vitamins category. There was a recent article in the journal, just about potentially increased regulation from the FDA over claims and so on. Anything that you've seen in terms of competitive activity in this space so far from some of the smaller players that might be facing increased scrutiny or changes in terms of retail shelf effect as there may be a different level of scrutiny on the category?","Matt Farrell","Yes. Hey we'd love to see that. I can't talk specifically about the journal article I don't remember seeing that. But when we bought the business it had a handful of competitors and today it's got 30. So we stand to benefit to the extent that there's going to be more scrutiny regarding disclosure and content of the gummy vitamins that we compete with.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thank you so much.","Matt Farrell","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Olivia Tong","Hey, thank you. Can you talk about any change in your view on the makeup of your organic sales growth target just effectively in terms of price\/mix versus volume particularly in Consumer Domestic? And then also a little bit in terms of how much of that price\/mix is lower promo versus actual list price increases? And then were there any categories where promo didn't decline? Or potentially was up? Thank you.","Rick Dierker","Olivia, here Rick. A lot of questions there. First question was really just a split between volume and price\/mix. For the company we said it was for Q1 about half 50-50. For the domestic division it was 1% volume 3.5% for price\/mix, so maybe 25% -- 75%. I would expect that trend to continue throughout the year. I think that's a good ballpark. Second question was maybe some other categories that weren't being promoted as much. Was that it?","Olivia Tong","Yes.","Rick Dierker","What I would just say...","Olivia Tong","Sorry. Just if there were any categories where promo didn't go down or it was actually up?","Matt Farrell","Yes. No the big ones are -- we went through earlier we did look at the liquid laundry detergent and litter those are the big ones. Personal care side of the house is less driven by promotion it is far more driven by a marketing. So that's generally not a topic for conversation in personal care.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And then in terms of international I know it's not as big. But on price\/mix there I know it's an elevated comp in Q1, but given the FX moves like I guess I was a little surprised to see that it was down year-over-year. So can you talk about what's driving that? Is that trial building? Is it just a mix of businesses? Anything else there to call out?","Rick Dierker","Well, no you hit it on the head. More than anything it's a comp issue. If you look at that business it was -- price\/mix was positive 5.2% in Q1 in 2018. For the year it was 2%. So if you just, almost at the stack bar if you had the stack up in Q1 5.2 minus 1.7 is 3.5. So that's 2% to 3% is right where that business is usually at for price\/mix. So it's more of a comp issue back in 2018. We did have some favorable price\/mix as we were exiting and had to reverse some charges from our China venture. So it's really just a comp issue.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And then just lastly in terms of Consumer Domestic obviously a lot better than you had expected specialty worse but net-net you'll obviously not be changing, you're maintaining your full year total company expectations. So can you just update us in terms of your expectations by segment from the full year basis?","Rick Dierker","Yes, I did it in my prepared remarks. But just to do it real quick again. Previously we had said for the full year back in February we said 2.5% domestic, 6% international and 9% for SPD that's 3.5% organic. Now we're saying 3% domestic, 7% international and flat for SPD to get to the 3.5%.","Olivia Tong","Got it. Thank you so much.","Rick Dierker","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Joe Altobello ","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning.","Rick Dierker","Hey, Joe.","Joe Altobello ","I have a question on the pricing that you guys took in dry shampoo and condoms. I believe that's incremental to your prior guide. So is there any EPS impact from that? And was it cost justified? Or was it more innovation-driven?","Rick Dierker","Yes, I'll take the EPS question Joe. It's -- it was, every single price increase that we talk about has to be cost justified in this environment. So it was cost justified to answer the first question. In terms of gross margin if you exclude FLAWLESS because sometimes it's just easier to think of it like that let's just strip out all the noise and FLAWLESS, we would've raised our gross margin from 10 basis points to 30 basis points of improvement right?","So that 30 basis points is made up of partly the new pricing that we got in the back half of the year for these personal care categories. We would've stayed at 10 basis points down for marketing would have stayed at 30 basis points of leverage for SG&A and we would've been 70 basis points of op margin expansion. And you say, okay, where do that flow through for EPS? Well, remember, back in February, I said, if we did a larger deal, we would take our $300 million buyback program and just do $100 million of it and that's what we did. So EPS is neutral, but operating margin is higher.","Joe Altobello","Okay. So it's just the lower share count, effectively. Secondly, just out of curiosity, Amazon going to one-day delivery for Prime members. Does that have an impact you think on the industry in terms of e-comm sales? Or do you think same day is really the game changer that has to happen?","Matt Farrell","I think, yes, it's a game changer. I think, everybody just going to have to move towards one-day and maybe same-day at some point in the future. I think that Amazon just keeps turning up the heat on all the bricks and mortar retailers. So that will be a competitive advantage for them until such time as others catch up.","Now it may not matter to some consumers at some point that whether you get it same day or next day. But the option -- having the option may matter to people. But it's definitely something to watch, something we're watching closely too, Joe.","Joe Altobello","But does it help you get to 10% faster, for example?","Matt Farrell","10% of online sales?","Joe Altobello","Of total sales, yes.","Matt Farrell","It's -- I don't know that's going to get us there. Whether it's two-day or one-day, that's going to change consumer behavior as far as buying online. We were up 40% year-over-year in the first quarter, our online sales. We got a big jump. So we're easily going to pass the 8% for the year. So we're all happy with the direction we're going and the skills that we're developing to compete digitally and online.","Joe Altobello","Okay, great. Thank you.","Matt Farrell","Okay. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So can you comment on the performance of the non-tracked channels? I believe the gap of growth had narrowed last quarter and Rick spoke to that on the Analyst Day. But it seems that it accelerated again this quarter. How is the rate of growth for e-commerce and club?","I know just in context of one of your competitors gaining more shelf space in laundry at some -- at one of the clubs. And just trying to seize the 3.5% organic that you called for the second quarter is, just be more conservative as you just printed 4.5%? I mean, just trying to -- because the tone about pricing and positioning into the second quarter has been I think more benign than what we heard from competitors.","And also a modeling question, if I can, just ask on the mechanics for the revenue recognition for FLAWLESS, because the old operator is still operating it. So I don't want to think -- it's not going to go, obviously, in organic growth. I was just wondering how to account for the different divisions and how it would be accounted in growth. Thank you.","Rick Dierker","Okay. Let's start with the tracked and untracked channels. So if you look at our -- if you look at Nielsen, our consumption growth would have been around 4%. Unmeasured would add about 1.5% or 150 basis points. We had really strong growth in e-commerce, as Matt alluded to, and other untracked channels as well.","That would get offset, though, by couponing of about -- around 70 basis points and all other around 30 basis points. So that will take you to the 4.5% organic that we're talking about. You also alluded to just a deceleration in Q2 for organic growth and really through maybe the back half of the year.","Well, remember, we are pulling back on promotions as we've talked about many times as we go through the year. So that does have an impact on volume. But we feel like we're in such a good spot that we can do that. Your third question was on FLAWLESS. And that was related to helping on the divisional breakout.","We're not ready to do that yet. This is -- we just closed yesterday. We're dealing -- and I -- we try to go into a lot of the detail on the -- kind of the transition portion of FLAWLESS for four months and then when it goes through every line of the P&L for four months. And the best guide we can give you right now is, plus 200 basis points or so to net sales for the company.","Andrea Teixeira","And that is implying the 15%, kind of, run rate of growth for that business?","Rick Dierker","It is. We said that business was $180 million trailing. If you times that by 15% you get low 200s. Divide that by 12 months times it by eight months, since we closed on May 1, that's around $140 million. That's around 300-and-some basis points. But remember, the funny accounting is that, we could only recognize the operating profit and net sales for the first four months. And so it's really less than -- it's around half of that. So we can go through it in more detail if you like offline. But it's -- that's why it's less than maybe what you think.","Andrea Teixeira","Okay, perfect. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to go back to the specialty segment. So I get some of the moving parts behind it. But I'm curious about just the dramatic change in expectations from February to now. What does it kind of say about the visibility that there is in the business? And does some of that incremental volatility perhaps make you, I don't know reconsider the segment itself? Or accelerating the change away from cattle to other animals, other categories within that? And you've talked about it, but it doesn't seem like it's enough to potentially stem some of that volatility.","Matt Farrell","No, the way you should think about that business is, it's got mid to high 30s of gross margins. And so it's moved up quite a bit over the last few years as we have made acquisitions into other categories. When you say, hey you went into the year looking for 9% and now you're looking for flat, some of the things that informed us about 2019 were; A, the milk prices would be recovering. There are some industry estimates that come out, that predict what -- essentially what they are milk futures since they predict what milk prices are going to do in the back half of 2019. We're less optimistic that that actually is going to happen right now.","The other thing that's hurting the business is the tariff war. So, for example, China is the number one importer of whey protein from the United States. So, obviously, that's depressing milk prices. And as the NAFTA-2 still hasn't been ratified, so that -- all those changes haven't wound up helping the dairy farmers.","So looking at that now in April, we're saying, we feel more like it's going to be flattish for the year. But long-term we still feel good about the business because we are effectively making the move diversifying away from dairy.","Mark Astrachan","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And also wanted to go back to the prior question on the retailer dynamics and the puts and takes of the pressures that they are dealing with. Perhaps help us in reminding how the businesses have trended or how the pricing dynamics have fared in historical periods where input costs are lessening as price increases or accelerating but the underlying inputs are actually becoming a bit more benign. So is there any chance that the retailers push back a bit more on price or that some of that is given back in the form of increased promotions going forward? So anything there certainly based on historical views would be helpful.","Rick Dierker","Hey, it's Rick. I'll just correct one thing. Commodities are not abating right now, right? Commodities are up year-over-year. We said Q1 for ethylene as an example was a little bit favorable to what our outlook was. But that's it.","In general commodities are up significantly still from 2019 to 2018. So that's -- in this environment -- and oil as you guys know is back up to around $64, $65 a barrel. So that's not what the narrative is right now. Price increases are happening because of commodity inflation that's existing out there.","Matt Farrell","Yeah, abating doesn't mean going backwards. But look these things move like glaciers over time. So what you're talking about is at some point if commodities now go in a down cycle and then what happens? Well, what happens historically is it creates a price umbrella and it gives suppliers the ability to promote. But we're a long way away from that.","Mark Astrachan","Thank you.","Matt Farrell","All right. I think that's it folks. Hey, we had a great quarter, sales were up, gross margin expanded and we'll talk to you all at the end of the second quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"4604":["Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, especially when we have great results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our second quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our current Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and soon to be my replacement as Chief Executive Officer. Rick Dierker is also with us today, who we announced this morning as Matt's replacement as CFO. When Matt is finished, I'll return to discuss our earnings guidance for the year, and then we'll open the call to field questions from you.","Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the second quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued soft U.S. consumer demand and foreign currency, the Church & Dwight team built upon our momentum exiting 2014 and continued to leverage our innovation-driven strategy to deliver strong business results in the second quarter and first half of 2015. This is exemplified by the fact that our organic revenue growth has averaged above 4.5% for three of the past four quarters.","As I stated in our previous earnings calls, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in any economic and competitive environment. Innovation has been a key driver of our past success, as shown by the fact that over 25% of our sales so far this year came from new products launched since 2008.","In 2014, we launched a record number of innovative new products across every one of our major categories and three new categories. In 2015, we launched fewer new products but our new launches covered every major category. Some of these new products like our new premium priced cat litter called ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL have become a huge hit with our consumers as reflected both in our brand's share results and its impact on category growth.","In 2014, our cat litter consumption increased by 23.5% and our share grew by 290 basis points for a record share of 22.9%. This enabled our brand to move from the number three brand in the category to a strong and growing number two brand. Just as important, our new product was a major contributor to driving an 8% increase in the cat litter category in 2014 \u2013 the strongest annual growth in any of our categories and an excellent growth for any CPG category.","This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key antidote driving improved value creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders. In the first half of 2015, we built upon this success by launching a new light-weight version of the CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. This new product is also off to a great start. Our total ARM & HAMMER cat litter consumption in the first half of 2015 was up double-digits almost 15%.","And our share grew 130 basis points to a new record share of 24.1%. And this growth helped drive the cat litter category up 8.8% in the first half over last year. Our goal is to continue to launch innovative new products to drive share gains and category growth like this in all the categories in which we compete. Overall, the second quarter results were excellent on the share front, (03:43) with share growth on two of our four mega brands and flat share on the third mega brand.","And I'll turn the call over I'll now turn the call over to Matt, to give you specific results on our second quarter results.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.55 per share, and that compares with $0.65 in 2014. The reported results include a couple of charges: a pension settlement charge of $0.05 that we discussed during our Q1 call and an impairment charge of $0.13 associated with the company's investment in Natronx, which is a joint venture that we entered in 2011 related to the specialty chemicals business. The details related to these charges are in the press release.","So, adjusted for these one-time charges, EPS would have been $0.73 or a 12% increase over the prior year, driven by strong organic sales. The $0.73 was better than our $0.70 outlook. And of course, netted in the adjusted $0.73 is a year-over-year drag of $0.03 from FX. That'd be 4.6%. So, if you add those together, it equates to a 16.9% currency-neutral EPS quarter. It's a good story.","Our reported revenues were up 4.8% to $847.1 million. Organic sales were 5.1%, which exceeded our Q2 outlook of 3% to 4%. And the organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic and international. And of the 5.1% organic growth, approximately 4.5% is due to volume, with 0.6% positive product mix and pricing.","Now, I'm going to go through the segments, first the U.S. business. The consumer domestic business' organic sales increased by 4.7%, driven by the continued success of our ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal cat litter, which includes a new lightweight variant. Second would be ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, which is up significantly in the quarter. And finally, OxiClean laundry detergent.","Going the other way, we had lower year-over-year sales of vitamins in the quarter. We have been living hand-to-mouth in 2015 as demand has exceeded capacity and retailers have been put on allocation. We've experienced untimely production difficulties at our existing vitamin plant and lengthy startup difficulties at our new plant. On a positive note, in recent weeks, the new plant is coming online. And the new plant is expected to expand our capacity by 75% once fully ramped up.","Back to the macro story; of the 4.7% organic sales growth in the domestic business, volume growth contributed approximately 4.5% plus 0.2 \u2013 20 basis points effect of positive price net of negative mix. We continue to expect full year organic sales to be approximately 2% to 3% for the consumer domestic business (06:46).","Now I'm turning to international. International organic growth was up 9.6%; volume increased approximately 7.3% with favorable product mix and pricing of 2.3%. We had strong growth in Europe, Mexico and our export business, largely driven by the success of our Batiste and Sterimar brands. We now expect the full year organic growth to be approximately 6% for the consumer international business.","Turning now to specialty products, organic sales was virtually flat, down 10 basis points, but in line with our expectations, driven by a difficult comp of 22.9% a year ago. I said in May that SPD, the Specialty Products Division, would come back down to earth in Q2 after four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Volume decreased 80 basis points and was largely offset by favorable product mix and pricing of positive 70 basis points.","The U.S. dairy industry is still healthy, although milk prices have declined year-over-year from an average of approximately $23 in Q2 2014 to approximately $16 in Q2 2015. The input costs, corn and soybean, are lower as well. So, the dairy industry continues to be profitable. Comps are very difficult the rest of the way this year for this business. Remember, last year Q3 and Q4 were both 20%-plus growth quarters. We now expect the full year to be approximately flat for the SPD division. For the total company, we continue to expect organic sales to be approximately 3% for the year.","Now, we'll turn to gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 44%, a 10 basis points decrease from a year ago, but largely in line with our flat expectations for the quarter. Q2 gross margin benefited from four factors: our higher-margin acquired businesses, productivity programs, lower couponing, and lower commodities.","These factors were more than offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix, and incremental costs associated with the new vitamin capacity in our York manufacturing facility as the start-up phase has lasted longer than anticipated. For the full year in May, we called 25 basis points to 35 basis points of gross margin expansion. We continue to expect that range in 2015.","Now, marketing. Marketing spend for the second quarter was $115.8 million or 13.7% of revenues, which is a 30 basis points decline from the prior-year spend rate, but a $2.4 million increase on a dollar basis. Our full-year expectation is still approximately 12.5% of sales.","Now, SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 13.5%, a 50 basis points increase from the prior-year second quarter, which includes an $8.9 million pension settlement charge. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.5%, a 50 basis points decrease from prior-year second quarter as we held SG&A dollars flat while growing the top line. Our full-year expectation continues to be 15 basis points improvement in SG&A year-over-year.","Other income and expense was $22.8 million, negative for the quarter, which includes a pre and post-tax impairment charge of $17 million associated with our investment in Natronx. As mentioned in the Q2 earnings release, Natronx is a joint venture that is engaged in the marketing and distribution of sodium-based, dry sorbents for air pollution control in coal-fired electric utility and industrial boiler operations. The charge is worth $0.13 of Q2 EPS and primarily a result of lower-than-expected demand for dry sorbents as a result of continued delays in the implementation of federal regulations. Adjusted other income and expense was $5.8 million negative for Q2; that's a $2.5 million year-over-year hurt.","Now, we'll turn to operating margins. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 16.8%, which was a 30 basis points climb from the prior-year second quarter. Adjusted for the pension settlement charge, operating margin was 17.8%, which is 70 basis points higher than the prior-year second quarter.","Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 38.3%, which, again, includes the previously discussed one-time items. Adjusted effective tax rate was 33.1%, which is lower than our full-year expectation of 34.5%. While the quarters can be uneven, we continue to expect the full-year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%.","Now, we'll discuss cash. We generated $248.4 million of net cash for the first half of 2015; this is a $42 million increase over the prior period. We have invested $34 million year-to-date in CapEx and continue to expect to spend approximately $70 million for full-year 2015. Cash from operations is expected to exceed $570 million and free cash flow to exceed $500 million in 2015.","Before I get to the second half comments, I'd like to make a few remarks. Last year, we posted 5% organic growth in the second half and 100% of our year-over-year EPS growth. So it was a backend loaded year in 2014. This year, we have more of the reverse, with higher organic in the first half and 60% of our full-year EPS in the first half obviously due to easier comps. Our most difficult revenue and EPS comps are in the third and fourth quarter.","Now, I'd like to comment on the third quarter. We expect Q3 EPS of approximately $0.87 to $0.88 per share compared to $0.85 per share last year. That's a 2% to 4% increase, which includes a 3% drag from FX. We expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 2% on a tough comp of 4.7% growth in Q3 2014. Last year in the third quarter, third quarter was a highly promotional quarter. As a result, our share of laundry peaked at 14.7% but our year ago gross margins were depressed.","We expect the continuation of a more normalized promotional environment which we've seen on the first half of 2015 continue for the rest of the year. We expect higher gross margins as a result but potentially slightly lower market shares in Q3.","With respect to the full year, to summarize our thinking, we continue to expect 3% organic sales and full-year gross margin expansion of 25 to 35 basis points. As we work our way down the P&L, we continue to expect marketing at 12.5% of sales and expect SG&A leverage of 15 basis points, resulting in operating margin expansion of 50 to 60 basis points.","Finally, other income expense line excluding the impairment will be approximately $20 million expense for the full-year. The full-year adjusted EPS range remains at 7.9% inclusive of a 3.5% drag from currency, and the midpoint of our range would deliver 11.5% currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth for 2015.","Just to wrap up on the second quarter, the highlights for the second quarter are as follows: 5.1% organic sales growth, 8% EBIT growth excluding charges, and 12.3% adjusted EPS growth.","Back to you, Jim.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt. Before we open the floor to questions, I'd like to provide a few additional highlights on our second quarter results in our key categories and business units. As you know, we continue to sharpen our focus on our four megabrands: ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, Trojan, and our vitamin business with each cover multiple categories. These four brands represent over 60% of our company's sales and profits, and we've achieved the most growth over the past five years due to delivering a bigger bang for every dollar of marketing investment than smaller one-category brands.","In 2015, we plan to spend over 80% of our media investment on these four megabrands. This investment continues to pay off, as reflected in my earlier statement that we achieved share growth on two of these four megabrands in the second quarter. The ARM & HAMMER megabrand had an excellent quarter with total consumption up 7% driven by its laundry detergent and cat litter products. I mentioned the excellent cat litter share results earlier for the total first half.","The specific second quarter results continue the strong momentum on this business as consumption grew double-digits and our share increased 110 basis points to a record 24.3% share behind the new CLUMP & SEAL product line.","ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent also had a solid quarter of growth. But before I talk about the growth of our laundry business, it's important to mention that the total laundry detergent category grew 1.4% versus year ago, the first quarter of growth in over three years.","This category growth reflects both the return to a more historical promotional environment and, second, that the category has now fully absorbed the unfavorable impact of the launch of the new unit dose form by all competitors. Hopefully, the laundry category will continue to grow in future quarters, as it historically did, driven by our category-building innovation and a more normalized promotional environment.","In terms of our specific laundry business, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a 10.4% share in the second quarter, up 60 basis points versus a year ago, the 22nd consecutive quarter of year-on-year share growth. As a total company, our three laundry brands achieved a 14.5% dollar share of total laundry detergent in the second quarter, up 40 basis points versus year ago. As a total company, we have grown share year-on-year in the laundry detergent category in 20 of the last 21 quarters.","We do not often talk about other products in all the categories covered by the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, but ARM & HAMMER carpet deodorizers achieved its highest ever quarterly share of 53.8%, up 570 basis points versus year ago. All in all, a great quarter for the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, which is our largest megabrand with over $1 billion in annual sales.","Next, the OXICLEAN megabrand had a solid overall quarter. The brand's total dollar consumption was up, driven by a 20% gain in consumption of the new OXICLEAN laundry detergent line, which was launched in the first quarter of 2014. OXICLEAN's share of the $1 billion stains fighters category, its original category increased by 80 basis points or 46.8%, which is greater than the combined share of the next three brands in the category.","Our third megabrand, the Trojan brand, had a solid quarter, as all three segments of this megabrand grew. The Trojan condom business achieved its second highest quarterly share in the past five years, at 76.4%, up 40 basis points versus year ago. In the total condom category, the top 13 SKUs all belong to the Trojan brand, and 26 of the top 30 SKUs are also Trojan SKUs. Other forms in the Trojan brand also had a strong quarter. The Trojan Vibrations line of products grew its share by 160 basis points to 55.3%. Our Vibrations line now has the top 3 SKUs and 5 of the top 10 SKUs in the category.","And finally, the Trojan Lubricant line, first launched in February of 2013, grew its share by 40 basis points to 7.5%, making it the number 3 selling brand in the lubricants category. While the condom category is relatively flat, our Vibrations and Lubricants categories are growing at high-single-digits, far above the average CPG category growth rate.","Last but not least is our newest megabrand, the gummy vitamin business, which we bought in October 2012. This business consist of two brands, L'il Critters for kids gummy vitamins and Vitafusion for adult gummy vitamins. Despite strong demand for our gummy vitamin business, sales declined in the quarter due to self-inflicted supply constraints primarily involving the slower than expected startup on our new production line in our York, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. These supply issues have now largely been resolved and we expect stronger vitamin sales in the back half of this year.","Despite the production constraints, our branded gummy vitamin business grew its dollar consumption by 4% in the second quarter, driven by a 9% consumption growth of our adult Vitafusion brand. Vitafusion continues to be number 1 adult gummy, with more than double the sales of the number 2 gummy brand. Overall, a very solid quarter for our four megabrands.","I'll finish off our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the year. As I stated in the press release, we are maintaining our 2015 guidance on organic sales growth and gross margin improvement. We're also maintaining our adjusted earnings growth target despite incremental foreign exchange headwinds.","You might question why we're not raising our targets, in view of our strong first half results. We just don't feel comfortable doing this at the time for several reasons. First, we had incredibly strong second half of 2014, as Matt mentioned earlier, so we have to comp over those strong results. Second, we expect category growth rates to continue to slowly improve, but still be below our company's revenue growth target of 3%.","Third, we intend to continue to invest marketing dollars to grow our four megabrands, and secondarily, our five other power brands behind our new product innovations to drive strong future growth. And fourth, we expect continued fluctuation in currency rates and needs reserves to handle those fluctuations.","In summary, we feel confident delivering our annual targets which are in the top quartile of EPS projections in our industry, consistent with our historical performance. We still have six months to go, and in our opinion, it's just too early to get more bullish, given the ongoing uncertainty about the worldwide economy, currency rates and competitive activity.","The achievement of our targets will be driven by our resilient portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products throughout every one of our major categories, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead costs.","I also want to assure you that we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions and have the significant financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions because we're very selective about the types of businesses we acquire, and we're very aggressive on how we integrate them into our existing business.","That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have which I, Matt and Rick will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Hey, Bill.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Just a couple of housekeeping items and laundry question. So when you said specialty sales are going to be flat for the year, is that organic or is that with the acquisitions?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","It's organic.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Good. And then why isn't the gross margin target a little more aggressive in the back half of the year? Just because it seems like if you look at the currency spot rates like the incremental impact kind of lessens but commodity flow through should be a little bit better on the pullback. Am I wrong in that calculus?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. That could happen, Bill. But as Jim said, to the extent that we beat our gross margin target, we're going to spend it back on marketing.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That is fair. And then, on the laundry side, it looks like OXICLEAN now is going to align price with ARM & HAMMER. Is that like a permanent price reduction, is that going to be the new price point for the product?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","No, Bill. OXICLEAN is not aligning price with ARM & HAMMER. OXICLEAN is priced above 20% below where Tide is. So it's up at the high end of the middle category or low end of the premium category.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I just look at that Nielsen data and it looks the average price per unit is identical now but maybe that's just promotional activity or something.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","It probably is just the short term promotional activity.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then one quick last one, on L'il Critters, do you guys think you need to find a licensing partner? Only because if you look where all the growth is coming on that gummy thing, it looks it's coming from guys who are licensing kids stuff.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","We do and we are.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I'll stay tuned. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust, your line is open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Hi, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'll just follow up on Bill Schmitz's question. I mean, in terms of the gross margin benefit and reinvesting it all in marketing, I mean, at some point, doesn't some of that need to fall to the bottom line? I mean, are you out-marketing your competitors by 3x, 4x? At what point is too much?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Bill, the way you can think about it is we said that unlike many of our competitors, we're keeping the marketing at 12.5% of sales. And obviously, the underlying metrics that you want to look at there is what's the share of voice versus share of market. So, we're always pretty vigilant about that. We have found historically that to the extent that we significantly over-index there, that we're able to drive growth.","So, we're not focused simply on what number are we going to hit this year. We're trying to build the brand equity for next year. And as you know, OxiClean is a brand that we're trying to establish in new categories, and we launched it in 2014. This is our second year. So, that's an area \u2013 one brand that we would certainly pour on the marketing where we \u2013 were it to become available.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Bill, let me build upon that, too. While some of our key competitors are cutting marketing spending right now, we are not. We also \u2013 as last year, we invested going into the second half of the year. We exited with very strong momentum, and that carried over into the great results in the first half of this year.","So, yeah, if we wanted to just worry about 2015, we probably could drop some upside opportunity that might happen into the EPS. But we're worried about 2015 and the future. And we want to exit this year with momentum and enter next year with momentum. So, we're going to keep that marketing spending up. And if we have additional dollars, we're going to pour it into it so we get off to a great start next year.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just switching to the plant expansion for vitamins, did you \u2013 I might have missed it \u2013 did you quantify kind of what the top and bottom-line hit was in the second quarter from that? And then will there be any incremental hit in the third quarter, I guess, through July?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. We don't ever get into the weeds on sales or gross margins or operating income by product or segment, Bill. Some \u2013 I wouldn't go into that kind of detail. But with respect to the third quarter, yes, there's definitely some overhang into Q3 for these charges that we're going to be taking in the gross margin.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","But was it meaningful or was it just a couple cents of EPS, or was it bigger than that?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. It's bigger than a bread box.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","They still delivered great results.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Your line is open.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning and congrats to Rick on his promotion.","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Thanks, Caroline.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Just wanted to \u2013 thank you. I just want to ask you about vitamins. It's feeling a little bit like the one acquisition that hasn't done exactly what you hoped. I mean, generally, if \u2013 generally, you want to be able to fold \u2013 I'm sorry. I don't know what that noise is.","You want to be able to fold in production into your own plants. Generally, there's some good margin leverage, and this just feels like a very, very competitive segment. Can you tell us what you feel great about, about the vitamin transaction, and what the next year or two or three might look like for you?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Caroline, that's a pretty fair assessment. What we feel great about is, this has been and will continue to be one of the fastest-growing categories out there. And keep in mind that the adult vitamin category, which is about 90% of the total business with about, I think, it's $3 billion or, I'm sorry, $3 billion of sales, only about 8% of that category is gummy today. So there's huge upside to converting the adult vitamin world into gummies.","So that's what we see, and honestly, in this case, we outsmarted ourselves. So we've tried to do a good thing in improving the quality of our gummies, and at the same time, we tried to build a real state-of-the-art production facility inside our plant in York, Pennsylvania, and we ended up screwing up both. And it was the biggest self-inflicted wound in my 11-plus year history as CEO, and because of that, we had some supply issues and lost some sales, but the good news is the worst is behind us.","We're digging out of this very quickly. We got to deal with some upset customers and that, but we're dealing with that well, and this business still has tremendous, tremendous upside, and we still are number one out there in that. But it was just a case of a \u2013 we tried to do too much too quickly, and again I'll say we outsmarted ourselves, and \u2013 but we fixed it. We fixed it, and the problems are largely behind us going forward, and we have a great brand and a great upside opportunity on this business.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","So, thank you for your frankness there, but do you think the next couple of quarters we still see a drag from gummies then?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. When you say drag, are you talking about sales?","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Sales, margins, everything. I mean, everything.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah, look, on the sales line the way you should think about it, as Jim said, the total \u2013 the gummy category, so if you look at gummies within vitamins grew 14% in the second quarter. So that is a very healthy place to be. We are capacity constrained and we're coming out of that right now. So obviously, when you have a retail or some allocation, they're very anxious to \u2013 for you to survive that and start increasing your sales. So we've got plenty of new items coming. Obviously, we've been restricted with our ability to launch them, but we do think that it's going to take another quarter or two for sales to accelerate for vitamins.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then just looking at international, can you talk about what drove the strength a little more specifically? I think you mentioned Batiste? And then do you see any more likelihood of being able to find an international acquisition, maybe even just a tuck-in, than you're seeing...","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. The...","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","...in the U.S.?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. The way you should think about international is that's somewhat front-end loaded. They had two terrific quarters, Q1 and Q2, and they're going to be more of a 2% grower in the second half. There were a lot of distribution gains that we got for Batiste. You hear us talking about Batiste quite frequently, not just in the UK, but in other countries as well. So, Batiste is a big puller there.","And then our export business is \u2013 that can be lumpy, and sometimes your export businesses can be front-end loaded. So, we saw some of that in the second quarter. We got some order that won't repeat in the third and fourth quarter. So, I would say with Batiste, distribution gains, the export business, some timing there, and, of course, we did have some strength in Europe and Mexico.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Caroline, I would add, too, we've made some organizational changes over the past two years in the international organization. And now we just have a rock star organization out there that's delivering great results in both launching new products and execution at retail.","So, I mean the results speak for them \u2013 almost 10% organic growth in some very tough markets like Europe where the guys are having a hard time. So, great organization, great new products, great execution. It's all adding up to some terrific results.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. My last question is on laundry. And just to \u2013 you touched on \u2013 you said something very interesting. You think the negative volume impact of pods is largely over. I don't know how the Persil launch is affecting the category overall, but any more detail you can give would be really helpful.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Caroline. The laundry category was hurt by the pods launch. It's a great innovative new product, but it did lead people to using less laundry detergent. It's now stabilized at about 13% of the laundry category. Every competitor has launched their pods, so there's no more upside from new launches out there insofar as new brands going out there.","You do know there was a very negative report that came out on July 16 from Consumer Reports, where they recommended that households with kids less than 6 years old refrain from purchasing the product. That's very, very recent news, we have not yet seen share results to show whether or not that's going to actually hurt the pods business. But we'll be watching that very closely as that was a very strong statement by the Consumer Reports organization which has a very powerful impact to consumers.","We honestly are the \u2013 we don't have a liquid laundry detergent pod out there which is what's causing this issue. I will take the blame, I held the organization back on that because I was very concerned about the consumer issues going on out there. We do have less than our fair share of the category but we have plans in place to get up to our fair share of that category. But right now, the pods as a percent of laundry has stabilized. We have focused much more up to now on the liquid part of the category \u2013 liquid laundry detergent which is over 70% of the category. And I told you we've had great results. I think we've had share gains in over 21 of the past 22 quarters and by far the biggest segment.","So that's kind of the story on laundry and we mentioned earlier too the promotional environment has kind of normalized back to historical standards over the past several quarters. So now you're getting up into the positive zone after several years of negative declines in the category, driven by the pods and by some overly aggressive promotional activities going on in the category. So I would say the future is looking much better out there. There are rumors out there that Persil is going national sometime maybe as early as the fourth quarter this year.","We don't know any more than that at this point about what its impact will be in the category. But overall, I think the future is looking brighter for the category going ahead.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Hi, guys. Good morning.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First again, I want to congratulate Rick as well, well deserved on that promotion.","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Not to throw salt in the self-inflicted wound, but I'm not sure you guys gave the consumption number for L'il Critters in the quarter. I may have missed it.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It was down, Joe. It was down. We got attacked by, as mentioned earlier, some competitive product and license stuff, and we took a step back on it. But overall, our total growth, consumption-wise, was up in the vitamin category.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And how long do you think that will last for? Is that still something that you see bouncing back by year-end or...","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't want to make predictions on quarters, but we have plans in place to launch new products from that to restore growth on our share on that business going forward.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then switching gears to marketing, you mentioned you're keeping it flat at 12.5% of sales. What's going on in the gross to net line? Are you seeing increased or decreased trade promotion activity within your categories?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","As I've said before, Joe, we said that we have a more normalized promotional environment that we saw in the first half of 2015 as compared to the second half of 2014. Q3 last year was particularly rugged.","So the transition going forward is one of the reasons why we expect to get some gross margin expansion this year was because of a more normalized promotional environment. And specifically, what you see less of is couponing. There's less couponing this year than last year in the gross to net line.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And just one last one, in terms of cat litter. Obviously, it's been a star for you guys. When do we start to lap the tough base periods in terms of category growth, or have we started to lap that category growth?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Joe. We're lapping it. We started lapping it in the second quarter of this year, so we're already doing double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth, and our product is just on fire. So we've had two years in a row now of great product innovation, both the base CLUMP & SEAL and our CLUMP & SEAL lightweight, and it has been awesome.","And we've gone, as I said, from a number three player to a number two, passing the number two player who has two brands in the category. Our one brand is now bigger than their two brand. So that's again innovation, innovation, innovation, drive the category, drive your brand, that's the most shiny example we have out there of awesome growth in a very tough category. So it's just \u2013 we're very proud of that and we'll get \u2013 we're trying to put that magic on all of our businesses.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Hey, Jason.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Let me echo the sentiment. Congratulations, Rick, well deserved.","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Thanks, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I hate to beat a dead horse, but I want to come back to vitamins and it sounds like a really unfortunate time to have some supply disruptions. You mentioned competitive activity heating up, service level dropping, and we're looking at some of the scanner data. Your distribution points have fallen 13% from the end of the last quarter. So it looks like you're losing shelf space at the same time that competition is heating up. What are the plans to get it back? And why should we be concerned that you're going to have some consumption weakness that's going to bleed for a more protracted period in the wake of this?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jason, I would just tell you. Yes, we've had some hits to the business because of our supply issues. But we have some great new products going out. We've got strong marketing programs going out behind all that. And our customers have largely, very much hung with us. And we just had the wounds and we dealt with it. So, again, there's so much upside in this category. There's going to be growth. There's going to be growth in \u2013 and now you have almost every major player in the category launching gummies. That's all they're talking about is gummies.","So again, you've got over 90% of the adult category out there to be taken. That's hard pills today over the gummies and everybody has validated that gummies are \u2013 as great as the hard pills. So I think we're going to get our fair share or more than our fair share with the new product launches we're bringing out and the brand support we have. So, again, yeah, I'll totally admit we had a short-term hit from this that was self-inflicted, but we have all the plans in place to get back on a growth trajectory for this business.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Good luck on that. Let me switch gears quickly to laundry. It's been a while since we talked about this, but compaction and the next wave was certainly the buzz over a year ago. It's died away. Can you bring us up to speed on where we stand in terms of compaction and where to advance what you think the impact would be?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll answer part of that. Right now, the tentative plans in the industry, there'll be about a 25% reduction in water in the product in the next wave. There'll be a test nationally starting in Q4 of 2016, and there'll be national launches by 2018. Those are the tentative plans right now, and as we never have and never will validate the exact financial impact of that.","Honestly, it's even too early to fully estimate that as we're all now in the phases of trying to finalize what I just told you means, and I'll be honest, we just don't know yet. It will not be as much as it was last time, and I won't tell you what it was last time, but it won't be as much as it was last time.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thanks a lot, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But it'll still be big. It'll still be meaningful because it's our biggest business.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sure. Sure. Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess going back to international for a second, was the distribution gain that you had in the first half, was that \u2013 was that pipeline fill, and I guess I'm trying to understand the fact that the growth was obviously very healthy, very volume-driven, but you also haven't really been pricing a heck of a lot given the currency environment. So, are there plans to price more, and was that pipeline fill that's going to lead off in the back half of the year?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. You're right in that. There's some pipeline fill, obviously, any time you're going to be entering new markets. But we still do have same store significant growth. So I wouldn't throw a bucket of water on that. That thing is a rocket ship, it's continuing to grow. As far as price goes, we actually did get some price in the second quarter. So we have done some selective pricing around the international business. So if you go back to the release, you will see that. And I wouldn't expect like you say for Batiste to suddenly plateau. On the other hand, we expect that to continue to grow in 2016 and 2017.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great. Okay. And I guess getting back to pods, how high a priority will liquid pods eventually be? I know Jim you mentioned the Consumer Reports article that's going to hit. I mean, are kids eating them enough of an issue to limit your investment in that category? Is that really what's setting the strategy?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I would say, we're watching this current \u2013 again, brand new news of several weeks ago has an impact on the category. But I fully believe pods will be here to stay. The industry is taking actions to deal with these issues and we fully expect to be a full-time player in the category. And again, we're safe from any legal issues right now with the liquid pods situation because we're not in liquid pods. But we have plans in place to build our business going forward. I just don't what to, for competitive reasons, get into what those details are.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. Thanks. And I guess last thing, just on gross margin bigger picture, right? Obviously, you guys have generated a huge amount of gross margin over time from high 20%s, right, to mid-40%s. Given it's a very competitive environment, it has been for the last few years. But it's kind of flattened out, right? So as you think forward in the next one, three, five years, can this company be a 50% gross margin business? And if so, how do you get there? Does it have to be more of a product mix issue? I mean, will we see you guys premiumizing it more?","Does it have to be more of an M&A story? But I'd be curious for your longer-term thoughts on that. Thank you.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah. I would tell you, yes, we've flattened out in the last year, year or two, but that was a pretty \u2013 a lot of our competitors went backwards. So, actually, we absorbed a lot of hits out there from a time period of higher commodities and foreign exchange, everything else going on. So while our performance has been flat, that's actually been better than competitors.","And I do believe we can get up to a 50% gross margin in this business. It'll be a combination of launching new products with higher margin, continued productivity gains and acquisitions. And it is our goal to get up to that point in time, and I'm not going to give you a timeframe we believe in that, but I do believe that's very doable.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","So first question on M&A. Anything that you guys can share in terms of what you're seeing \u2013 valuations, pipeline activity within certain categories?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Are you kidding?","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","No, I mean, just some incremental color, Jim. I'm not asking for too much.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a very active marketplace out there. We are incredibly actively engaged in that marketplace. But as you know, we're very picky, and that pickiness has paid off huge dividends in the past in terms of the accretive value that we drive through acquisitions.","So, I assure you that I'm probably spending a major part of my time going out and looking for the right acquisitions right now, and again, nothing big has happened so far. We picked up some wonderful small acquisitions that have been nicely accretive to our women's health business, to our SPD business in that. So I can just guarantee you, we continue to be hot and heavy looking for the right deals out there, and when they happen, you'll be the first to know.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for that, Jim. Matt, on the guidance for the year now, sort of tying in laundry and some of the discussion earlier on Persil, do you feel confident there's sort of enough cushion in the guidance? There would certainly seem to be given the commodity favorability and strong first half of the year should pricing get worse in the laundry category. We've often seen this when it's new product introductions, and particularly given that Persil seems to be aimed at Tide, if there could be the potential for some promotion here in the back half of the year.","So the first question, do you feel comfortable you have enough cushion there should you guys need to respond? And second, sort of unrelated to the Persil dynamic, is XTRA, which hasn't gotten a lot of discussion on the call but has really struggled. And I know you guys are well aware of that, and there's been discussion in the past about stemming some of the losses there, but it just hasn't happened yet. So, maybe you can talk a little bit about that as well, sort of returning to growth in XTRA. Thanks","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. Hey, with respect to the full year, Kevin, you know that there's always pluses and minuses that go into any of our forecasts. So when we scorecard the rest of the year, all of the things that you cited are on the page. So, the answer is yes, we obviously always forecast to leaving ourselves some flexibility to react to market conditions.","As far as your observation about XTRA, your assertion is what, that XTRA is declining?","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. I mean, based on the scanner data that I'm seeing, it looks like it's declining significantly, at least in liquid, yeah.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","So our 13-week data would say that XTRA is flat. It is true that it had been on the down swing over a many quarter basis, but we've corrected that. We put a lot of promotion behind XTRA this year in order to deal with some of the competitor actions. So we expect that that's going to be stabilized, and it's going to return to growth.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just, Matt, quickly on Oxi. Are you guys pleased \u2013 it looks like you did promote. I know Bill Schmitz asked a question earlier about pricing and parity, but it looks like that was driven by promotion, which you guys have ramped here over the past 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks. Are you guys pleased with where you are with the entry there into liquid at this point based on repeat purchase rates?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Kevin, this is Jim. I would say, are we pleased with where we are? No. We want to be higher. We're very pleased with the progress. We had a big 20% gain in consumption in the second quarter. So, we've got good momentum behind the business right now, and we feel good, but we want to continue to grow the business.","It's a great product. It's a great performance out there. We're very, very happy with the progress we've made in the beginning of this year. So, we're in the right direction. I would say within the customer where Persil is, OxiClean is performing very well versus the majority of the Persil SKUs. In fact, the majority of the Persil SKUs don't deserve to be expanded. And so we're not that fearful of Persil at this point in time.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Kevin, something else that might be helpful to you is that OxiClean's share is 1.2% in laundry. But where we have distribution, we're over a 2% share.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. No. That is...","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Remember, we're still trying to get trial and distribution in 2015.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Great. That is helpful. Thanks for the time, and congrats, Rick.","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Great. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the OxiClean line of questioning. Where does laundry share for that brand need to be? You mentioned kind of that 1.2% \u2013 2% in the outlets you're in. But where does it need to be before you're comfortable about just the sustainability of shelf space? It's obviously done well, but you're spending still a lot on trade spending to secure that positioning. I'm just trying to figure out how long that needs to go on especially where you've got Persil and others entering new products in the category.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. Well, you've got to appreciate, this is \u2013 we have not been in the upper end of laundry. That was our entry in 2014, so we priced this product 20% below Tide. So now, we're up against Tide and Gain, and more recently, Persil comes in. So, it's a crowded area and this crowd is not going to roll over and play dead. So, it does require a significant amount of promotion and advertising in order to get trial. So, as Jim said, yeah, we're okay where we are. As far as how you're going to hold shelf for long-term, significant \u2013 you got to be below 2% \u2013 or above 2% share. And we're at 1.2% today. We're at 2% where we're in distribution; we've got to get over 2% to hold share long-term and then grow from there.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Steve, keep in mind, this is a \u2013 laundry detergent is a $6 billion category so a 2% share is very meaningful revenue results. And we are again, as Matt said, where we have good distribution, we're over that already, and we're building distribution in other places (48:24).","So, it's a challenge. We believe it's very doable. We have the plans in place, we have new product launches coming to support that and we will achieve that in my mind. And again, if we had created and launched the Steve Powers brand, and we were spending all this money, I would say it was a big mistake.","But we spent all the money behind the OxiClean brand very smartly from a marketing standpoint and that's why we continue to do well on the original OxiClean additive brand is doing very well in the marketplace, benefiting from all the advertising we're spending on the laundry detergent version of it. So, and also the bleach version, we didn't even mention today, the launch into bleach last year, the Oxi brand has done extremely well. So, very incremental to the business.","So, again, this is why we believe in mega brands because when you spend behind a mega brand, expand it to a new category, you get a lot of benefit on the prior parts of the brand that are out there, from the halo of the advertising bag. So we're very much going to continue strong support behind OXI laundry detergent, and we believe that will benefit the whole OxiClean megabrand.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","All right. I'll look for the Steve Powers brand extension next year. Just on the guidance for the second half where you guided to a deceleration, and I'm talking about from the top line perspective. I'm not surprised by the slowdown, just acknowledging the tougher comps. But it feels a little bit more stark than you had previously anticipated. Is that the vitamin issue? Is it changing assumptions in specialty? Is there something else in the margin creating that incremental caution, or is it just conservatism?","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Yeah. Hey, Steve. It's Rick. So let's talk about it from the total company perspective first. So in Q2, on a stacked bar basis, a year ago, we were at 3%, and we're at 5.1%, so that's an 8%. If you do the same thing for Q3, it's around a 7%. And if you peel that back and you take the specialty product business out and international timing out, and you just look at the domestic business, the stacked bar for Q2 is around 5.5%, and for Q3, it's a 6%. So we think it's actually a pretty decent quarter when you look at it like that.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. First on vitamins, have you brought in outside help to help you work through some of our your production difficulties, and if not, is there a need to?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","That is quite an open-ended broad question because you're assuming that there \u2013 what the issues are. Our issues are simply that in our Vancouver plant, we had some equipment that went down, and that was just one of those things. So we had to repair the equipment in our existing plant. In our new plant, the startup was expected to be completed in March. We have \u2013 this is very sophisticated equipment, it has to all work in a synchronized fashion. And once you get it rolling, it rolls. And it's producing now the way we want it to produce, but it's taken us three or four months to get there.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, Olivia, too, we've had some customers come in to see our new facility in York, and they've been blown away by the sophistication of it and its potential. So, again, we did the right thing, building a real state-of-the-art, spaceship-type plant that will produce \u2013 increase our capacity by 75%, and it was just a little more difficult than we estimated.","We're very aggressive, and we had a very aggressive timeline, and it was a little more difficult than we estimated to get this state-of-the-art facility going. But we're very impressed by its potential. Our customers who have been in there to look at it are blown away by its potential, and it's just, we've had this short-term hiccup and we'll get it behind us, but it's being fixed.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. So it sounds like September quarter, you'll still have some impact, but by December quarter, you should \u2013 you think that you'll probably be sort of on the path to where you had hoped to be earlier this year?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's right.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","That's good. Yeah.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thanks. And then just following up on international, I mean, I know it's small for you, but the price mix contribution was only 2% versus the FX hit of 15%. So is there an opportunity or plans for incremental pricing and it just hasn't hit yet, or is there something else that impedes the ability to price up to where the FX hits are?","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Yeah. It's a decent question, Olivia. You got to remember, most of the categories we play in, in these countries are \u2013 we're a relatively small player, so we don't have the pricing power to really take FX impacts. So the 2% is largely in Brazil where there is currency impacts, and I would say the whole country price is up. But in general, no, we don't \u2013 we can price up all the way to cover currency.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is there more incremental opportunity than the plus-2%, or if competition is not moving then obviously it's tough for you to push that?","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Right. I would say plus 2% is a reasonable number.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly on personal care, you did discuss Trojan but can you talk about trends in your other personal care categories as well, just the competitive challenges in those categories? Thanks so much.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The other personal care categories, they have actually performed better over time than some of the household categories. And household again was dragged down by the laundry category, which was a big part of it. And we've had good results. Our shares have been strong in those categories. There have been some pricing competition in things like pregnancy kits, which has caused a bit of a war out there. But, no, we're \u2013 we got a lot of new products in those categories, and we're very happy with those products from that.","And if I had one wish in life, I'd wish I get the Trojan category growing. The condom category has been relatively flat now for quite some time, but we're working on some major new product launches in that category and some great new marketing programs to help to get that going forward. Because that's the case with a 76.4% (54:16) share, it's really incumbent upon us to drive the category more than share growth, so \u2013 but we have some plans in place over the next two years, which I find very promising to rejuvenate that category and get it growing again.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Thanks so much, and congrats, Rick.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good. One more question, guys, and then we're going to \u2013 we have to get off to back to building this business.","Operator","Okay. Our last question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair. Your line is open.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Two quick ones, do you have a timeframe that you can share for how you're thinking about growing into the new capacity, the new vitamin capacity? I know you said it increases your capacity 75%, so just a reasonable guide post there would be helpful. And then on \u2013 in terms of margins in the business, you're committed to maintain a marketing ratio, I think, in the kind of range we're running at today, 12.5%. You've seen quite a bit of SG&A leverage in 2013 and 2014, not so much in 2015. But is it reasonable to think, going forward, as we look out to 2016 and beyond, that more of the margin expansion, to the degree that there is, is going to be driven by gross margin, just given kind of the dynamics this year? Thanks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jon, on the vitamin side, we wouldn't have built a plant with 75% volume upside if we didn't think we would use it. We're just not in a position right now for a reason to expand upon that and how we plan to get there and when. So, a good question, but sort of like laundry compaction, we're not going to answer it. And then on the gross margin side, I'll turn that over to Matt and Rick.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. With respect to SG&A, you're right. We've had a lot of SG&A leverage over the past few years. But part of our long-term model is we try to grow our operating margins 50 basis points annually. And the way you're going to get that is \u2013 the lion's share of it is from gross margin. That would be 25 basis points to 35 basis points, and the rest is going to come from SG&A. And as we saw this quarter, if you hold SG&A dollars flat, you're going to get leverage. You'll have 15 basis points of leverage in the quarter.","So, yeah. You have to be vigilant about how you manage SG&A. We're not going to get the 50 basis points or 60 basis points a year from that line item. Acquisitions, obviously, can help because our acquisition model is essentially we buy marketing contribution, which is gross profit minus marketing. So that gives you instant leverage on your SG&A. And that has been part of our story historically. So, yeah, there's lots of leverage to go in there. Hopefully that's helpful to you.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, it is. Thanks, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you all \u2013 good, thank you. I'd like to thank you all for tuning in today. Another great quarter from Church & Dwight, a great first half of the year despite the problems we had on vitamins and a lot of great things coming in the future. So, thank you all for your good questions. And if you have any more questions, give Rick, or Matt, or me a call and we'll do our best to answer them.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have great results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our first quarter business results, which you've read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to discuss our earnings guidance for the year and then we'll open the call to field questions from you.","Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the first quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued weak U.S. consumer demand and foreign currency, the Church & Dwight team built upon our momentum exiting 2014 and continued to leverage our innovation-driven strategy to deliver strong business results in the first quarter of 2015.","As I have stated in our previous earnings release and at the CAGNY Conference in February, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in any economic and competitive environment. Innovation has been a key driver of our past success, as shown by the fact that over one-third of our sales in 2014 came from new products launched since 2007. In 2014, we launched a record number of innovative new products across every one of our major categories and three new categories. In 2015, we launched fewer new products, but our new products covered every major category.","Some of these new products like our new premium priced cat litter called ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL, have become a huge hit with our consumers as reflected in both our brand share results and its impact on category growth. In 2014, our cat litter consumption increased by 23.5% and our share grew by 2.9 points to a record share of 22.9%. This enabled our brand to move from the number three brand in the category to a strong and growing number two brand. Just as important, our new product has been a major contributor to driving an 8% increase in the cat litter category in 2014, the strongest annual growth in any of our categories and excellent growth for any CPG category.","This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key anecdote for driving improved value-creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders. In the first quarter of 2015, we built upon this success by launching a new light-weight version of the CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. This new product is also off to a great start. Our total ARM & HAMMER cat litter consumption in the first quarter was up 15.5% and our share grew 1.4 points to a new record share of 23.8%. And this growth helped drive the cat litter category up 8.6% in the first quarter over the first quarter of last year.","Our goal is to continue launch innovative new products to drive share gains and category growth like this in all of our categories in which we compete. Overall, the first quarter results were excellent on the share front, with share growth on three of our four megabrands.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt, to give you specific details on our first quarter results.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. So, first quarter EPS was $0.80 per share; that compares with $0.73 last year in the first quarter, so we're up 9.6%. The $0.80 was better than our $0.78 outlook, and netted in our $0.80 is $0.03 or a 4% drag from FX year-over-year. So we're off to a very good start in 2015.","Reported revenues were up 3.9% to $812 million. Organic sales for the quarter was 3.6% and this exceeded our Q1 outlook of 3% organic sales. The organic sales beat was largely driven by the success of our international business and the continued strength of our animal nutrition business. Of the 3.6% organic growth, approximately 3.2% is volume-driven with 40 bps of positive product mix and price.","Now, we're going to go through the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales increase was 1.6%, and that was in line with our expectations, and was driven by ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter, VITAFUSION adult vitamins, and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent. Now these increases were partially offset by lower sales of XTRA laundry detergent, TROJAN condoms, and OXI laundry detergent. Remember last year, we had the launch of OXI laundry detergent in the first quarter.","So the 1.6% met our expectations; we were lapping the new product pipeline from last year. It was our largest year ever of innovation in Q1. The volume growth contributed approximately 1.2% to organic sales, plus 40 bps effect of positive price net of negative mix in the quarter. We expect full year organic sales to be approximately 2% to 3% for our Consumer Domestic business, and notably in the second quarter, we expect 3% to 4% organic growth from domestic.","Now we're going to talk about International. International organic growth was up 9.5%, volume contributed 10.5% with product mix and pricing being a drag of 1%. We had strong growth in France, the UK, Mexico and our export business, largely driven by two brands, Batiste and Sterimar, which is our nasal hygiene brand. We expect the full year to be approximately 3% to 4% organic for the Consumer International business.","And now turning to Specialty Products, organic sales for the Specialty Products division increased 10.8%. The animal nutrition business drove a 7.7% volume increase and we also had favorable mix and pricing of 3.1%.","With respect to the Animal Nutrition business, currently, the U.S. dairy industry is still healthy, driven by demand for our products \u2013 driving demand for our products, I should say. We expect organic sales for this division to come back down to earth for the balance of the year. We have very difficult comps ahead of us for this division. Remember last year in Q2, Q3 and Q4, we grew 20% year-over-year in each of those three quarters. So, for the full year, we expect the Specialty Products business to be up 3% to 4% organically. So now, total company, full year, we expect organic sales to be approximately 3%. And you saw that in the release.","Gross margin is next. Our reported first quarter gross margin was 43.8%. That's 40 bps better than last year. If we look at it year-over-year, 20 bps came from volume and price and the other 20 bps is the net of higher margin acquired businesses net of FX drag.","The company's outperformance versus the outlook, remember that our outlook was flat gross margins for the quarter, our outperformance was due to higher-than-expected volumes, earlier-than-expected benefit from commodities, and some of the start-up costs related to our new vitamin plant have moved to the second quarter.","For the full year, remember in February we called 25 basis points of gross margin expansion. Now, we have 40 basis points of a beat in Q1, so that's going to live through for the year and that's what's driving the change in our gross margin, the 25 to 35 basis points on a full-year basis.","Now I'm going to talk about marketing. Marketing spend for the first quarter was $88.8 million or 10.9% of revenues, that's 30 basis points lower than the prior year's spend rate, but it's $1 million higher on a dollar spend. Marketing is a function of the timing of our product launches, as you know, and our full-year expectation is still approximately 12.5% of sales.","Next is SG&A. So SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.7% in Q1; that's a 20-basis-points increase from the prior-year first quarter. That's primarily driven by incremental amortization of intangibles and higher R&D costs. On a full-year basis, we still expect 15 basis points improvement year-over-year in SG&A as a percentage of sales.","Other income is next. So other income was $9.1 million negative, that's $2.2 million worse than the prior year. And that's primarily driven by transaction FX. And next is operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.2%, which is 50 bps higher than the prior year first quarter. With respect to income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 35.1%. And that's higher than our full-year expectation of 34.5%. The tax rates in the quarters can be lumpy, but we continue to expect the full-year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%.","Cash is next. So we generated $144 million of net cash from operations in the first three months of the year and we invested approximately $22 million in CapEx year-to-date. That's a big number for a first quarter, but remember we were wrapping up construction of our new vitamin plant in York, Pennsylvania.","We expect to spend approximately $70 million on a full-year basis on CapEx in 2015. Cash from operations is expected to exceed $570 million and free cash flow to exceed $500 million. We bought back $250 million of shares in Q1. That's right on target with what we said in February. And remaining on our share repurchase authorization is approximately $332 million.","Just a word on the new vitamin plant. As you read in the release, we are starting up our new vitamin plant. We have been living hand-to-mouth for a number months as demand has exceeded our capacity. And the new plant is expected to expand our capacity by 75%. And the future prospects for this business are very bright as more adults switch to gummy vitamins.","I'm going to wrap it up now. So, the first quarter highlights include 3.6% organic sales growth; 9.6% EPS growth, which, by the way, equates to 13.6% currency neutral EPS growth. Thinking ahead to Q2, we expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.70 compared to $0.65 last year. So, that's 8% up year-over-year in Q2. And that excludes a pension termination charge of about $0.05 that we expect to occur in the second quarter, and we've been talking about that one for a while.","We expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 3% to 4% and flat gross margin. With respect to flat gross margin, that reflects our greater vitamin plant start-up cost shifting to Q2, as I mentioned earlier, and the negative drag of FX, and also further investment in OxiClean in the second quarter. And the commodity relief is going to be as expected for Q2.","Now the full-year. So, last year we had all of our EPS growth in the second half of the year. So, 2014 was a back-end loaded year from an earnings perspective. This year we have higher organic and EPS growth in the first half due to easier comps, and our most difficult revenue and EPS comps are ahead of us in the third or fourth quarter.","With respect to the full year, just to bomb down the income statement, 3% organic sales, a gross margin expansion of 25 to 35 bps, marketing at 12% of sales, and 15 basis points of leverage on SG&A. So that math gets us to operating margin expansion of 50 to 60 bps in 2015. And to the extent we over perform on gross margin expansion, and we intend to invest incrementally in marketing behind our megabrands.","One thing I missed was other income and expense. It's going to be relatively flat year-over-year, about $17 million of net expense. And the full year range remains at 7% to 9%, that's despite a 3% drag from currency. We used to think it was going to be 2.5%, so it's got a little bit worse.","Back to you now, Jim.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt. Before I open the floor to questions, I'd like to provide a few highlights on our first quarter business results in our key categories and business units. As you know, we continue to sharpen our focus in our four megabrands, ARM & HAMMER, OxiClean, Trojan, and our vitamin business. These four brands represent over 60% of our company's sales and profits, and we have achieved the most growth over the past five years due to delivering a bigger bang for every dollar of marketing investment.","In 2015, we plan to spend over 80% of our media investment on these four megabrands. This investment continues to pay off as reflected in my earlier statement that we achieved share growth on three of these four megabrands in the first quarter. The ARM & HAMMER megabrand had an excellent quarter, with total consumption up 4.3% driven by its laundry detergent and cat litter products. I previously mentioned cat litter results in which consumption grew 15.5% in the first quarter and our share increased 1.4 percentage points to a record 23.8% share behind the new CLUMP & SEAL product line.","ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent also had a solid quarter growth. While the total laundry detergent category was down 1.3% versus a year ago, the rate of decline has steadily improved for past four quarters. Hopefully, this category will soon begin to generate positive growth again driven by innovations and the return to a more historical promotional environment.","In the first quarter, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a 10.0% share, up 0.5 percentage points versus year ago, the 21st consecutive quarter of year-on-year share growth. As a total company, Church & Dwight achieved a 14.1% dollar share of total detergents in the first quarter, up 0.6 percentage points versus year ago. We have grown share year-on-year in the laundry detergent category in 19 of the past 20 quarters. And we're one of only two manufacturers in the category to post dollars sales growth and share growth in the first quarter.","We do not often talk about other products and all the categories covered by the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, but ARM & HAMMER carpet deodorizers achieved its highest ever quarterly share of 50.1%, up 4.2 percentage points versus year ago. And ARM & HAMMER baking soda achieved its highest ever quarterly net sales in the first quarter. All in all, a great quarter for the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, which is our largest mega brand with over $1 billion in annual sales.","Next, the OxiClean megabrand had a strong overall quarter. The brand's total dollar consumption was up over 20% driven by the new OxiClean liquid laundry detergent line, which was launched in the first quarter of 2014. OxiClean's share of the $1 billion stain product category, its original category, declined by two-tenths to 44.9%. But this is still greater than the combined share of the next three brands, which are sold by three companies many times larger than Church & Dwight.","Our third megabrand, the Trojan brand, had a mixed quarter. The Trojan condom business achieved its highest quarterly share in the past five years. It's 76.6%, up 0.2 percentage points versus a year ago. In the total condom category, the top 14 SKUs all belong to the Trojan brand and 26 of the top 30 SKUs are also Trojan SKUs.","Other forms of the Trojan megabrand also had a strong quarter. The Trojan Vibrations line of products achieved an 8.3% increase in dollar consumption and recorded its second highest dollar sales quarter ever. Our Vibrations line now has the top three SKUs and six of the top 10 SKUs in the category.","The Trojan lubricant line, first launched in February of 2013, has now achieved an 8.5% share of the category, making it the number three selling brand in the lubricants category. This new product line continues to show share potential as revealed by the 11.3% dollar share that it achieved during the week of Valentine's Day, an all-time high for the brand.","Last but not the least is our newest megabrand, the gummy vitamin business, which we bought in October 2012. This business consists of two brands, Li'l Critters for kid's gummy vitamins and Vitafusion for adult gummy vitamins.","Our gummy vitamins business had a solid first quarter despite supply constraints, which we believe will be shortly resolved by the startup of the new production line in our York manufacturing facility, which we expect will increase our production capacity by about 75%.","First, there was great news concerning the growth of the total vitamin, mineral and supplement category. As you may recall, this category has been one of the fastest and most consistently growing categories in all of consumer packaged goods for many years.","Then, in the fourth quarter of 2013, a study was released which question the positive health benefits of taking vitamins. This negative news led to several quarters of flat to declining consumption of vitamins. However, the category started to rebound in the second quarter of 2014. And now, it's starting to demonstrate more robust growth as reflected in the 4.3% growth achieved in the first quarter of 2015.","Second, our branded vitamin business grew a stellar consumption by 7% in the first quarter, driven by a 13% consumption growth of our adult Vitafusion brand. Vitafusion continues to be the number one adult gummy vitamin with more than double the sales of the number two gummy brand.","Third, our Li'l Critters kid vitamin business is struggling right now as dollar consumption fell about 10% in the first quarter, driven by some aggressive competitive pricing and new products. We expect to reverse these trends by the end of 2015, driven by some new products that will be launching. Overall, a very solid quarter for our four megabrands, with three of the four achieving share growth and, in some cases, new record shares driven by our product innovations.","I'll finish off our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the year, just to reiterate what Matt just told you. As stated in the press release, as a result of our strong first quarter results, we are raising our 2015 guidance for organic sales growth from 2% to 3% to 3%. And we're raising our expectations for gross margin improvement from 25 basis points to 25 to 35 basis points, and we're maintaining our earnings growth target of 7% to 9% despite an increased drag from currency from 2.5% to 3%.","We feel confident in delivering these targets, which are in the top quartile of EPS projections in our industry, consistent with our historical performance. It's just too early in the year to get even more bullish, given the ongoing uncertainty about the worldwide economy, currency rates and competitive activity. The achievement of our targets will be driven by our resilient portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products across every one of our major categories, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead costs.","I also want to assure you that we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions and have significant financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions, because we are very selective about the types of businesses we acquire and we're very aggressive on how we integrate them into our existing business.","That ends our presentation. And I will open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Jim and Matt, congratulations to both of you. Jim, on your retirement, and Matt, on being promoted to CEO.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kevin.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Thanks, Kevin.","Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC","If I can start with \u2013 and Jim, I appreciate it's a personal decision, but I think investors will be curious with respect to timing. Because I think it's a little bit earlier since people are expecting, including me. So to the extent you can comment on that. And then I think, what it may or may not suggest with respect to transformative M&A? And then I have a follow-up.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Kevin. What I would tell you is it's the right time for the company and for me. The company is in great shape, and with great plans in place. And we know there's new product pipeline for the next two to three years. The acquisition pipeline looks better than it has for some time. And we have a strong productivity programs in place. And I strongly believe that Church & Dwight can continue to deliver industry-leading TSR results. And I have great skin in the game on this decision, if you want to know. Over 75% of my networth is in Church & Dwight stock, and I intend to keep it that way, because I do have great faith in Matt and this company's future.","Hey, I've been CEO for over 11 years here. But I'm going to be 62 years old by the end of this year and there's other things I want to do in life and do them before I get too old to do them. So, in my mind, it's time to turn the reins over to someone younger and have a smooth transition over the next eight months, and Matt's perfect choice, guys.","He is a great leader, he understands the secret sauce to our success, and he's proven that his skills and business acumen are way bigger than being just a great CFO. And trust me, I'm staying on as Chairman to be here for whatever assistance I can to Matt.","So that was basically the thinking. It was my decision to do this and I'm very happy with it. I'm so proud of this company and the results we've turned in, and I have great faith, as proven by my financial networth tied into this company, in the future and I'm sure Matt will protect that or he will be getting phone calls from me. Okay.","Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for that. Just one more follow-up with respect to the role now. So when the announcement was put out back in November, Jim, your intent was to spend more time on strategy and M&A. Matt, is that going to be your intent also to be devoting more time to that come January of next year or should we expect the further announcement of a COO? And then also if you can comment when we will know who is the CFO replacing Matt will be? Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. With respect to acquisitions, Kevin, acquisitions have always been an activity that the entire management team has engaged in. When I was named COO, that was an opportunity for Jim to pull back a little bit and let me take the reins of the company. But the acquisition effort is always a team effort, CEO, CFO, and the entire leadership team. So that is going to be unchanged going forward.","As far as the CFO replacement, no decision has been made with respect to who's going to replace me at this time.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we do not expect to replace \u2013 have a new COO. We'll eliminate that job.","Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Congratulations, obviously.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","My first question is how much did the Venezuelan pricing impact sales in the quarter? I'm just kidding. Can we talk about just the laundry category broadly? So like are you seeing any reinvestment for some of the Europeans or the currency help? We saw the Persil launch, I'm curious like where those facings came from. And then detergents, did the ARM & HAMMER brand get some incremental distribution, because the gains have been great?","And then, lastly, on the unit-dose thing, it doesn't seem like it's a flash in the pan anymore. I mean, it continues to grow double digits. I know it slowed a little bit, but it's the only piece of the entire category that's growing. And I have a little follow-up, if you don't mind.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hey, Bill. The laundry category, obviously, our biggest category, had good trends in the first quarter. It's still, like I said in my notes, it's slightly still negative versus year ago, but it's been four steady quarters now of improvement, and it's on the verge of going positive, so that's a good sign. The promotion and pricing environment also tended to get better in the first quarter. The pricing was up a little bit in the overall category, which is good, and the volume done on coupon was also down, which is good; so that was a good result. We've just seen the April Nielsen results that just came in and the category, again, continues to trend in a good direction on that. We had great share results in the first quarter. We just saw April. We're off to a great start in April, so that looks good.","Unit-dose also, I think we promised folks we'd put a bigger effort behind this thing. I just saw April results and I think our consumption in April was up something like 28% on unit-dose; that was great. And those programs are kicking in now going forward, and we intend to get back to our fair share of that business.","I can't comment on the Persil thing yet. I think it's too new to know what happened there, and what distribution came from. That's still trying to be figured out.","But overall, feeling much better; continued improvement in the category. We continue to do very well in the category. We're fixing issues we had on things like unit-dose. So, right now, I'm kind of going from a yellow to green lights in the laundry category and I hope it continues that way.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just on the vitamin side, are you guys in allocation now? So is there like a scenario where that business sort of snaps back just because you can't fulfill all of people's orders?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't use the word allocation but we are \u2013 we cannot supply all the orders right now. We're doing our best job of being fair to all customers, but that problem should be resolved shortly.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And congrats again, guys. I appreciate it.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your question, please.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First on the commodity front, I mean, I understand you saw a nice benefit on gross margin this quarter, but it seems like, or from what I can tell, resin prices have come down even further inter-quarter. So, it would seem like some of the bigger benefits are still on the horizon. So, how should I look at the gross margin rate of conservative? And just what we know now or do you feel like that's a pretty good number at this point?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","We think it's a pretty good number, Bill. So what that would mean is if you do the math, if you're up 40 bps in the first quarter and call flat for the second quarter, that means in the second half, you're going to have to be up 50 bps, right, in Q3 and Q4. So, the commodity help came a little bit sooner than we expected. And you're right about resin, there's a lot of help of there.","Going the other way are things like diesel. We have some diesel hedges that actually have us higher than spot. So we don't always get that right, but that's \u2013 I remember saying in February down at the New York Exchange that those were some hedges that we were sad about.","And transportation is also a bit of a ding for us as well and may be worse than expected. And that's with respect to lane rates and availability of drivers and things like that. So on balance, 25 bps to 30 bps is about right for us right now.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then switching back to detergent, maybe you can give a little color on what's going on with XTRA. I mean, I wouldn't think that sees a whole lot of pressure from the P&G brand. So, I mean, what's going on there? And then also on OXI, kind of in year two, are you net gaining more distribution for liquid laundry detergent or are you at least holding the share you got from last year?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Bill, on your specific question, XTRA was kind of hurt by all the competitive activity last year and also hurt by unit dose a bit. So, we have put plans in place to fix that. Again, I just saw the April shares come in and XTRA had a good, solid month there, and we have good programs going forward. So I feel like we've got plans in place to put XTRA back in the growth mode.","On OXI, again, we launched last year, it was a tough environment with all the unit-dose activity and with the launch of Tide Simply. Brand got a good foothold. We have plans in place to continue to grow that. I think consumption on that was up double digits in the month of April also. So, we feel good momentum now going on both the XTRA and OXI and we've always had great, strong growth on ARM & HAMMER, the biggest brand of all.","So, I feel very good about the laundry business right now. I feel it's heading in the right direction and I hope it continues that way.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color and congrats on the changes.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your question, please.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","First, I had a follow-up on unit dose. The product now that \u2013 and as I've seen it, is really kind of like a powder in a pouch. Are you doing any work to have a liquid formulation?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't project, Lauren, on based on what we're doing in the future. When and if we do something, we'll let the world know, but not until we launch anything.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I just didn't know if I missed anything, frankly. Okay. And then on the International business, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit, I think I always have a hard time, it feels to me that when you've got better-than-expected growth, I can never really put my finger on why. So if you could talk a little bit like how those businesses are managed. Is there a Mexico country manager, are there calculated growth plans by quarter, or is it really kind of managed almost as a virtual export business? Thanks.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. That's a good question. So, the way to think about International is as follows. So we have an EVP that's in charge of the International division, and that EVP has a number of general managers that report to him. Canada is our biggest subsidiary and so we have a follow-on legal entity in Canada, in the UK, in France, in Mexico, Brazil, Australia and China, so that's around the league. So we have a general manager in every one of those countries and a legal entity.","And on top of that, we have an export business. And our export business is not entirely in U.S. dollars. In fact, more of it is not in U.S. dollars. It's in pounds and also in euros, so that's good news for us because we're not as impacted by the strong dollar with respect to our exports. But you should think of it as you have all those countries and you have full management teams in each of those countries selling brands, and those brands, by and large, are more local brands than our megabrands.","We do have some megabrands that travel, so for example, ARM & HAMMER detergent in Canada and Mexico, so North America. But that obviously wouldn't travel over water very efficiently. So, outside the U.S. it's more personal care businesses and more local brands. So then when you say, you have an eye-popping number in the first quarter, you say, wow, 10%, where did that come from? Part of that is because we had easy comps here. Last year, the International business rolled a doughnut in the first quarter. So that's number one.","Secondly, it can be somewhat lumpy. So, if you look at the last two quarters, Q3 was up 1.7%, Q4 was up 7.4%, and now we post a 10%. But I wouldn't get used to that because we're expecting on a full-year basis, 3% to 4%. So, I would say easy comps. We have a new product performance, and export shipments sometimes can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. And it's the law of small numbers, right. So 10%, but you're on a much smaller business. So it doesn't take as many sales dollars in order to drive a big percentage growth.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Lauren, I want to add too that we have some, Matt said local brands, some of them have travelled in various markets. Two brands in particular, Batiste, which is a dry shampoo business we bought a few years ago, is growing like fire right now. And our Sterimar business, which is a nasal hygiene business, is doing exceptionally well and it's in almost all those countries and those are both high-margin personal care type brands.","So, our team internationally is incented the same way as the U.S. team. The measures of revenue, gross margin, cash flow, and their earnings contribution and that. We had great teams, great general managers, great leaders of the organization. They're just kicking butt right now. And I'm a little more optimistic than what Matt may say, but I think, because again, we've got greater innovations going in those marketplaces and great teams going in place there.","And our export business, we're exporting some of these hot products into the countries where we don't have direct general managers and they're also doing very well.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","And one last thing on International that I think is also useful to know. The way we manage Europe is on not a legal entity basis. We have France and the UK legal entities, but we have a European team. And Europe actually is now our largest subsidiary and has eked out the number one position over Canada.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Wow, okay. And how big is the export piece of the International business? 20%?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","It's not \u2013 I'd say it's about $100 million, round numbers.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks. This is really helpful. And Jim, I can't help but ask. Are you moving to Cincinnati? I feel like I owed you one. You made fun of all of us for so many years. I had to give you one.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We were buying them and moving them here.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. New Jersey. It's a good state. Thank you so much.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for the question. Congratulations to both of you.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Thanks.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","One thing that surprised me with the transition, Jim, was your assumption of the role as non-executive versus executive chairman. Can you talk a little bit about what this means to your level of involvement beyond this year?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jason, honestly, I'm a big believer, as my predecessor was, there's only one CEO of a company, and you got to let them run the company. You don't want two cooks in the kitchen there. So, I got a great guy in Matt. We've been attached at the hip for eight years. He knows this company in and out. He knows he's been basically running the company for a while now as COO, and we don't need two people running it. That's how companies get screwed up, in my mind, when we got two people at the rutter.","We got a great guy taking over at the end of this year. I'm fully here until the end of the year. Trust me, I'm fully in place, and then Matt will take over fully on January 1 and I'll be, as non-executive chairman, I'll be in charge of the board and I'll be there if he needs me. As my predecessor said, if you need me for something special, I'll be glad to step back in on that, but there's only one guy going to drive this company. That's the way it's been, that's the way it works best, and that's going to be Matt Farrell.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. I agree. Capable hands with Matt. You mentioned Persil, you don't really want to talk too much about it, it's too early and you gave a lot of statistics in sort of looking backwards what we see in the data so far. I know you guys are close to the retail trade, any early indications that P&G maybe retaliating to stop Persil in its tracks?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Not that we see. I mean, I'll call Cincinnati, but no.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, good. Hopefully, we don't see it. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Your question, please.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I also would like to extend my congratulations. It's going to be sad not to see you Jim at CAGNY next year, but hopefully you could make an appearance for us, so \u2013 anyway.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah, Joe, he didn't say he wasn't going to CAGNY.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's a very good point, that's a very good point. So, in terms of the overall marketplace as you see it today, is there a shift going on within your categories between advertising and promo? Because if your marketing spending is staying the same on a relative basis, and laundry is getting better I think from a promotional perspective, what are your other categories doing in terms of that shift from above-the-line to below-the-line or vice versa?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, good question, Joe. Every category is different, but first I would say, there's continued improvement in the category growth rates on the quarter. Not big, again. In past quarters we've had maybe four of our nine key categories growing. Now we're getting \u2013 it's getting better than that. So we're seeing slow but steady progress in the marketplace, which is a good sign.","I'd have to go over every category for you, which is different. Again, general trends are good, overall. There's a few categories where there's still a little bit of pricing wars going on and things like that. But I'm encouraged. I hope it continues in this world that people are getting back to the game of innovations driving categories and not letting pricing and couponing driving category. I think we've all learned that's a road to nowhere. So, we're seeing good, slow \u2013 very slow but steady progress and a good direction here. I hope we get back to the days where you get 2% to 3% category growth. Maybe \u2013 hopefully, we'll get there, but we're not there yet. But I'm very encouraged by what I see out there in the marketplace, and I just hope it continues.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then in terms of personal care, it seems like that business, or that segment, was flattish to down on an organic basis. You talked about a few things going on there. But vitamins was still up, I think, even though you're constrained a little bit. It sounded like Trojan was down a little bit. So if you could tell us what's going on there that's sort of keeping you guys from really growing that segment?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, vitamins, we have to be careful. When we say vitamin category, we're talking about the whole category, hard pills and gummies. And the whole category was up like 4%. The actual gummy segment is up like 9% to 10%. So, that's really encouraging news. That's why we bought into this business because the gummies was the fastest-growing piece of the business.","So gummy is doing very well. Again, we had a decent quarter. It would've been better if we could've supplied everything that we had orders for. But things are very good there. As I said, the category rebounded from the bad PR news that happened a year ago. In the good old days, this category was growing high single digits. We're now back to about between 4% to 5% growth, and I hope it continues growing that way. And the gummy piece is two times that as far as growth where we have the key piece there.","The other one you mentioned, the condoms. Condoms has always been kind of a strange category. It's not that big a category, it's about a $350 million category. We have, obviously, a very strong share there with about a 75 or 76 share. But it can also be flat. And it's just the case of there's a lot of alternatives. The birth control out there, there aren't a lot of alternative to disease control, which upsets us, but we have great new products out there.","Like I told you, we have a strong position as far as the leading SKUs in the category. And we're going to keep bringing new innovations in that pipeline, new advertising. I don't want to tip my hand. We've got some really cool programs happening in the back of this year to help it. In the meantime, we're building our vibrations business and our lubricant business, which are very high margin businesses there and we're leveraging the Trojan name into those categories.","So, I feel good. I feel good. Especially, the new product pipeline looks awesome and I would love to tell you what we have coming, but it's against my policy to tip my hand to competitors on what's going on there. I feel very positive about some of the new innovations we have coming in the next year or two.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck to both of you.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS. Please go ahead.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Good morning, congrats from me as well. Hey, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the gummy capacity and how you plan to use that when it comes online? I understand obviously the near-term capacity constraints. But thinking longer term, will this be used more to increase production and distribution of existing categories or should we now expect a more material acceleration in your moving into new adjacencies?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. Hey, Steve. We wouldn't comment on where we're going to go for the growth. I mean, the category is growing double-digit, particularly the adult vitamin category. We expect that to continue to grow in the future. So, there's enough opportunity today where we are to fill up that plant. And you're not going to fill it up immediately. That's a tremendous amount of capacity growth. Remember, assume the business is around $350 million, like 75% capacity is over $200 million of sales capacity. So, what we're really saying is that we believe in this category. We've made a big investment there and we think it's going to be a part of our growth for a long time in the future.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe just a quick update on cat litter, which continues to be great. Just any that you're thinking there given presumed new innovation from competitors. I'm guessing the answer is yes, but are you comfortable with your plans ahead of that, securing your shelf space across the whole portfolio, that kind of thing. Thanks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Steve. I maybe talk too much about this, it's because I love talking about this business, because it's the absolute case. Hey look, cat litter is one of the simplest products to make in terms of ingredients, and yet we found ways for product innovations to make a better, and better, and better cat litter. This new CLUMP & SEAL cat litter is by far the best cat litter in the marketplace. The consumers are reacting to it. We've had a real challenge to keep up the demand. And then on top of that, we launched the lightweight behind it, which solves a major issue in the category. If you're a cat owner, lugging home those boxes is like an Arnold Schwarzenegger act sometimes. But we came out with a lightweight that's half the weight of the previous product, and the consumers just loved that.","So I just love \u2013 we have some products which are very complicated to make and things like this. This is a relatively simple product to make with simple ingredients with some interesting technology, and yet we've been able to drive category growth in the high single digits, and that's the thing I wave in front of my people's faces. If we can do this on cat litter, why can't we do this on everything. And innovation is the name of the game, your premium price it, you put it out there. The consumers love it. Even in a tough economy where you hear about value all the time, and we certainly love that with our value laundry business and that, people love trying innovative new products and they'll pay a premium for them, especially when they deliver premium performance. And the cat litter one has been the best example for us of this, and we're just kicking butt in this category. And we have more new innovations coming, and it is exciting to us.","And of course, you know, cat is an overall good category. Pets are the new kids; two-thirds of American households have a pet, only one-third have a kid. So it's a great category for growth and we're taking advantage of that and bringing innovation to the marketplace. So, I'm sorry, I have verbal diarrhea sometimes when I talk about this category because it's just a great example of what I want to do in every one of our categories. And our cat litter team is doing it, and our other teams are trying to do it, too. So, it's the name of a game and all competitors should pay attention to this and do it. It's a win-win for all of us.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Cool. I see pet gummies in your future. Thanks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And, guys, I won't get sentimental on you, especially you, Jim. Just a couple of things, I guess, one, usually you're pretty good at talking about consumer health and consumer behavior patterns. I'm just wondering since CAGNY, have you seen anything over the last couple of months, lower gas prices and maybe some wage increases. Have you seen anything kind of on, I would say, the low end of your portfolio at this point that gets you a little bit more optimistic as the year progresses?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It's interesting, Jason, we've all read the report, the results \u2013 studies done by Visa and everything else which said initially about 75% of the savings from the gas were going into either paying down debt or being put in the bank account of consumers. My sense is it's starting to ease up a little bit and there's starting to spend a little bit more money out in the marketplace, particularly when they see innovative new products.","I think you're also seeing a little easing by manufacturers in \u2013 of their pricing aggressiveness out there, as they feel they don't \u2013 they should focus more in innovation and not focus so much more on pricing. And again, the bottom-line result of that is the categories continue to slowly \u2013 very slowly, but slowly show improvement versus year ago in the trend.","So, I don't want to say I'm overly optimistic at this point, but again, I'm still probably in a yellow light but I feel there's more green creeping in, every month go by. And again, I just saw the April results and they were very encouraging, particularly for our business, very strong and the categories were also continuing to show improvement. So, I got to hope this continues and it will only encourage all the manufacturers to continue to focus more on innovation and less on price wars, and lots of consumers love that because they want to try innovative new products and that. So cautious still, but slightly getting greener every day.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. No, that's good. And then the other question I have is I was wondering if you could kind of \u2013 like, if you look at the consumer domestic piece of this for this quarter in terms of breaking down between \u2013 you talked about the megabrands, but maybe talk \u2013 and then, the non \u2013 I guess, non-megapower brands and then the non-power brands, so the tail brands that you still have in there.","I know with the non-power brands \u2013 I'm getting tongue-tied here, they still kind of weigh a little bit down on the growth overall, what you're doing in terms of trying to stabilize the growth there. Those are businesses that don't really get much A&P. But I'm just wondering, could you talk maybe a little bit about the profitability or what those brands are doing to contribute to overall accelerating growth in the portfolio?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll be glad to. And again, you're making a good point, just because we so focus on the megabrands does not mean we've really taken focus off the other brands we have. And we have four or five of what we call power brands. Just quickly, Nair had a great year last year and is having a great year this year; off to a very good start. And the key season's coming up now for consumption, so we've shifted a bunch of new products, we've gotten great retail distribution for them, but now we'll see with the weather and the consumer what happens in Q2 when consumption happens.","The pregnancy kit businesses, that's been one where we've had a little bit of pricing wars going on in the category. But we have some big new product innovation coming in that business and looking forward to getting that category back to innovation.","Toothbrush category has been a little \u2013 again been a lot of competition there, a lot of pricing there. So that's been a little bit of a tough category for us, whereas the toothpaste business has been very \u2013 we've had some good signs there, some good decent growth in that category. So that's kind of the recap.","As far as the \u2013 what do you want to call them, the tail brands or whatever that everybody has in their business, that's probably about I'd say 10% of our revenue base. I'll be honest with you, I've taken a personal project. I have a special team of a bunch of marketing folks who work on that, and I've personally gotten involved with that, meet with them once a month to help to not only slow any decline in those brands but try to drive growth in those brands, and we continue to find every way to do that kind of thing. So it's kind of a fun project for me personally to get involved with those businesses, and we're planning some really cool stuff.","We've had some great successes there. ARM & HAMMER baking soda, which is one of those smaller brands, is delivering some good growth there. As I mentioned, our carpet deodorizer business is actually now over a 50% share of the category, kicking butt of some big competitors out there doing well. So we love to find ways to get out there.","Kaboom is a brand that's had a little bit of softness on it, but we've got some new innovations coming. So, trust me, we don't give up on our brands and go sell them like some of our competitors. We believe they're still decent brands, but we're smartly spending most of our money behind the big megabrands, but we're also finding innovations and smartly spending behind some of these smaller brands, too. Overall, it's good.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And congrats, Dr. Farrell.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Guys, I guess you probably noticed it, but so many of your competitors are talking about taking marketing down. There's a big push on \u2013 pushing spending out of non-working media into working media. You were the only ones where the actual media spending as a percentage of sales isn't really doing much. So can you talk about \u2013 I guess what are you doing on the non-working to working side and what do you think your share of voice has done in your categories over the last year or so?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Chris. I almost want to thank you for bringing this up. I think it's a big charade by our competitors about what they're doing. I think they're cutting their marketing spending or telling you they're shifting it over and saving money because they can get the same bang for the buck. They're not. They're either trying to cover, in my mind, their foreign exchange hit or they're trying to cover sales hits there. So, I am not a big believer in shifting to digital and getting same bang for less money.","We are increasing our commitment to digital. But we're not using that as an excuse to cut our marketing spending. We're keeping our marketing spending strong, as we told you about 12.5% of sales. So that's on that issue. No, I would just tell you we're keeping our market support strong. I actually hope to take advantage of the fact that our competitors are cutting back on their marketing spending; and our share of the voice, which you're dead right, is a thing to watch.","Our share of voice is strong to up in most of our categories because we are continuing to spend same amount of money while our competitors are cutting. So, I'm a big believer. And again, you can't launch innovation and just put it on the shelf and expect people to look at it, and understand it. You got to have the marketing support behind it. And we are going to maintain steady marketing spending at about 12.5% of revenue. The formula has worked. It's delivered the great steady organic growth we've had. And we're going to continue doing that. And I'm not going to use this \u2013 trying to watch my language here. I'm not going to use this game of telling you I can cut my spending.","By the way, our non-working to working level has always been low. So we don't have a game we need to cut back and punish our agencies and take money away from them. We always have very good agencies. We've had a long-term relationship with the three key agencies we have here and we've always paid them a fair thing, but not some of the outrageous wages some of our competitors do so. And they've been great partners for us and know our brands as well as we do and have been a key part of our growth. But it's not a case there where we've had bloated non-working costs at all. But we have very happy partners, been with them for a long time.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So you don't see any material decline in non-working media going forward, I guess?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Not for us.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, okay. And I guess on a separate note, I think you guys mentioned incremental OxiClean investment as one of the gross margin drivers. Can you talk about that a little bit, give a little more detail?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","No, simply that we're in the second year of our quest to drive OxiClean to be in our second megabrand. So we have a lot of spend ahead of us and that's just one of the year-over-year drags in the second quarter.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, doesn't sound like it's a very material piece of the -","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. Thanks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Chris, let me go back for a second. Let me give you a little perspective on the non-working to working. It's the same perspective as overhead. Everybody is all talking about the 3G effect out there and a lot of people are cutting overhead. Well, we were there a long time ago. We invented the whole keeping overhead low. We have the \u2013 I've been bragging about this constantly, we have the highest revenue per employee in the entire industry, and yet we keep getting better finding ways to do it. But it's not a case like we're waking up like some other guys and trying to cut overhead because they're bloated.","Same thing on non-working; we've always had a very, very leading-edge ratio of non-working to working, and so we're not sitting here bloated and looking for opportunity to cut it. So, if you look at that as bad news because I don't have cost savings, well, too bad. I mean, we're already aggressive there. Now, we keep looking for ways to save as we have on the overhead side, especially with the acquisitions. We bring them in and leverage our top line and kind of hold the overhead line so our percentage goes down. So, I just feel we've always had great attention in those areas and it's helped to deliver our great results.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for the perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Your question, please?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Wanted to touch back on laundry, because it sounds like you feel better about laundry overall, trade spend's normalizing, fixes to unit dose, et cetera, but it didn't look like at least from a track channel perspective that your sales did trail off a little bit towards the end of the quarter and going into April as well. So perhaps can you talk a little bit about that?","And then also I know it's early on the Persil launch, but how, if at all, have you adjusted your own plans as a result of that launch?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Olivia. Every quarter has its \u2013 you know, you can't have strong results for all three months of a quarter. And we generally, we had a very strong middle of the quarter and somewhat strong at the end, so you can't look at a four-week period and just say we were weak exiting Q1. I told you, we already saw the first four weeks of Q2, just came in, they were very strong. So, overall, things are tracking. We've had what I'd say 19 to 20 quarters we've grown ARM & HAMMER liquid. In 21 to 22 quarters we've got overall laundry detergent growth in the past four years. The only guys to have growth every year for the past four or five years. So, we're still trending there very well.","Persil, I can't really comment on Persil. It's way too early. We have not adjusted our spending to deal with them. Don't forget they are premium priced, which is just a small part of our business. The big bulk of our business is value priced, so I would expect any pain from that launch to be more focused at the premium end of the market.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then, Matt, you guys addressed M&A strategy, no change there in terms of your thought process, but what about other parts of the business and just the portfolio overall?","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","That's a very open-ended question. Could you be more specific?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just thinking about how you \u2013 I know it's still six-plus months before you take the helm, but just thinking about your thought process as you address the portfolio, whether you think anything is going to change when you move into the top spot.","Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. Well, look, one thing about Church & Dwight is we are very transparent. And we have a known strategy, we have a very explicit business model, and that we go out of our way to make sure \u2013 not only on the sell side, but all of our investors understand the direction of the company. And the direction of the company is set. So we're a company that focuses on innovation. So we're good in innovation, we're terrific at execution and cost control, and we've proven that we're first class when it comes to identifying and integrating acquisitions.","So none of that's going to change. And we feel good about our \u2013 we have four megabrands that generate a significant amount of our revenues and profits. The last thing we're going to do is take our eye off the ball there and, as Jim said, we have other power brands that also generate significant amount of cash earnings, which are also important to us. So, we try to grow the whole portfolio and we feel good about our family of brands that we have right now.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats to both of you and best of luck.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, operator, I've got an annual shareholders meeting coming up here in a little bit, so I'm going to cut it off here.","I want to thank everybody for tuning in today. I'll just leave you with a thought. We've had a great start to the year. We got a lot of stuff ahead of us here, and I think we have great programs over the back half of the year, and again, I'm very excited. I thank you all for your comments today about the transition here. I assure you it's going to be extremely smooth. I assure you it's going to be business as usual with Church & Dwight. Matt understands the mojo or the secret sauce whatever you want to call it about this place, and there's no plan to change any of that and he's got a great team of 4,000 people behind him who understand that.","So the Church & Dwight for the past 11 years is going to be the Church & Dwight for the next 11 years. So we're going to continue deliver industry leading total shareholder return results. That's our goal; we're going to do it. So thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation and have a wonderful day.

These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","James R. Craigie","Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to share our insights on the company's business results. I'll start up this call by providing you with my perspective on our first quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to discuss our earnings guidance for the year, and then we will open the call to field questions from you.","Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the first quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued weak U.S. consumer demand and a highly competitive environment, the Church & Dwight team successfully executed the first phase of our innovation-driven strategies by gaining incremental retail distribution for all of our great new products.","As I stated on our last earnings release and at the CAGNY conference, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in any economic and competitive environment. Innovation has been a key driver of our past success, as shown by the fact that over 25% of our sales in 2013 came from products launched since 2007.","As promised, we launched a record number of innovative new products in 2014, across every one of our major categories and 3 new categories. This represents the first time in our company's history that we launched a great new product in every one of our major categories in the same year and the first time that we launched [ph] into more than one new category in one year.","Our sales force did an incredible job in gaining incremental distribution from retailers in every category. Gaining incremental distribution is the key first step for driving future sales and profit growth, so we are off to a great start.","The second phase of our innovation-driven strategy is to drive consumer demand for the new products via the marketing program supporting their launch. This marketing support started at the very end of the first quarter on all but one of the new products, so it's too soon to judge the consumers' reactions on the new products.","However, one of the new products, our new premium-priced cat litter called ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal began shipping in December of 2013 before the other new products. Therefore, marketing support for this new cat litter began in January before the other new products. This new cat litter has been a huge hit with our consumers, as reflected in both our brand's share results and its impact on category growth.","Our consumption increased by 15% and our share grew by 1.3 percentage points to a record quarterly share of 18.5%, which enabled our brand to move from the #3 brand position to a strong #2 brand in the category. Just as important, our new product has been a major contributor to driving category sales up over 9%, the strongest growth in any of our categories and excellent growth for any consumer packaged goods category. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key anecdote for driving improved value creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders.","Overall, the first quarter results were excellent on the share front, with share growth on 3 of our 4 mega brands, namely OxiClean, TROJAN and vitamins, that we held share in the total ARM & HAMMER brand, driven by increased marketing support.","Unfortunately, some of our competitors have not invested in developing new products and instead have increased their trade and coupon spending to defend their brands. This happened particularly in the laundry detergent category in the first quarter. Church & Dwight is the only competitor that has grown share in the laundry detergent category every year for the past 5 years. We are now the #2 player in the category, and 1 out of every 4 washloads is done with a Church & Dwight laundry detergent.","The growth of our laundry detergent business has been driven by our value pricing, great new products, increased distribution and higher marketing spending. Our largest laundry detergent brand, ARM & HAMMER, has posted year-on-year share growth for 17 consecutive quarters, including share growth from the first quarter of 2014. Our OxiClean laundry additives brand has posted year-on-year share growth for 10 consecutive quarters and achieved a record quarterly share of 45.1% in the first quarter, which is bigger than the next 4 laundry additive brands combined.","In the first quarter of 2014, we launched innovative new products on our ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent brand, and to continue to support our remarkable record of share growth, we extended the OxiClean brand into the laundry detergent category and gained excellent incremental distribution by the end of the quarter.","Several competitors who lack innovative new products preempted the start of our marketing programs for our new laundry detergent products and for P&G's new Tide Simply Clean & Fresh product by putting unprecedented levels of trade and coupon spending behind their brands to disrupt our launches. The increased competitive trade spending was a key driver of the 5% decline in the liquid laundry detergent category in the first quarter and has temporarily impacted the trial of our new laundry detergent products.","However, as you know from our long history of success, one of Church & Dwight's greatest strengths is our ability to respond quickly and effectively in response to changing circumstances. So we have taken actions designed to restore our competitiveness and drive strong trial behind our great new laundry detergent products, just as we did on our new cat litter.","I will not divulge or answer any questions concerning specifics of what we have done for competitive reasons. I will just tell you that I'm extremely confident that these actions should enable us to deliver our 2014 sales and earnings per share commitments.","I'm also pleased to report the continued strong growth of our most recent acquisition, the Avid gummy vitamin business. Despite increased gummy competition and some negative press concerning the benefits derived from taking multivitamins that hurt the overall category growth, we delivered double-digit consumption growth in the first quarter and are maintaining our double-digit sales and consumption growth outlook for the full year.","This sales growth will be driven by the launch of new vitamins for kids and adults, increased retail distribution across our full line of products and increased marketing spending. These actions will help to maintain our strong #1 share position in kids' gummy vitamins and significantly grow our #1 share position in the adult gummy vitamin category by encouraging adults to switch from swallowing hard pills to enjoying our delicious-tasting gummy vitamins.","Please keep in mind that the adult vitamin category represents $6.8 billion in sales, and gummy vitamins as a whole represent only 6% of those sales. The adult gummy segment has already doubled in size in the past 18 months, and that still leaves 94% of the total category as upside. We doubled our ad spending on gummy vitamins in 2013, and we are increasing our advertising spending by at least 30% in 2014 to continue to divert adults to our delicious-tasting gummy vitamins.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt who will give you specific details on our first quarter business results.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. First quarter EPS was $0.73 per share, and that compares with $0.76 in 2013. That's 4% less than a year ago.","The $0.73 was a little better actually than our $0.72 outlook for the first quarter. The negative drag of FX in the quarter reduced year-over-year EPS by 1.5%. Our reported revenues were up 30 basis points to $782 million on the organic side. Organic sales was up 1.2%, which was in line with our Q1 outlook of 1% organic sales growth.","So of the 1.2% organic growth, approximately 4.4% is due to volume, with 3.2% negative product mix and price. And of that 3.2% negative price mix, approximately 2% is attributed to investments in slotting and couponing in our U.S. business, and this is behind our 2014 new product launches, which we showcased in February when we provided our full year outlook.","Now let's review the segments. The consumer domestic business's organic sales increased by 40 basis points in the quarter, reflecting sales of OxiClean liquid laundry, ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal cat litter and higher sales of our vitamin -- or Vitafusion vitamins. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER and XTRA detergents.","Volume contributed approximately 4.4% to U.S. sales, partially offset by 4% negative effect of product mix and price. With respect to negative product mix and price in the U.S., slotting and couponings behind our new products accounted for 2.2% negative price mix.","International organic growth was flat year-over-year. The volume decreased approximately 60 basis points, while we had positive price mix of 60 basis points. Canada and Mexico contracted in Q1 net, which was offset by partially by a growth in -- year-over-year in the rest of the world.","For our specialty products division, organic sales increased by 12.4%. The animal nutrition business drove a 15.3% volume increase, which was partially offset by a 2.9% unfavorable price mix. The U.S. dairy industry is very healthy right now, which is driving demand for our products.","As you saw on the release, we expect total company organic sales for the year to be at the low end of our 3% to 4% range, and Jim will comment more on that later.","With respect to gross margin, our reported first quarter gross margin was 43.4%. That's 150 basis points contraction from year ago first quarter. The decrease in gross margin, again, is primarily due to slotting and couponing investments behind our new products. This alone accounted for 100 basis points of the drag year-over-year. And the balance of the drag is due to -- primarily due to premium distribution costs that we experienced in the first quarter due to weather, it shouldn't -- no surprise to everybody, and also some negative mix driven by the strong Specialty Products results, which, of course, have lower gross margins.","Regarding commodities, our input cost trended up in Q1, and in particular, this is due to resin, which is at a 3-year high. And for the full year, we expect gross margin to contract 50 to 75 basis points, largely due to price competition in the laundry category. We previously expected 2014 gross margin to be comparable to the prior year, and we'll say more about that later.","Marketing spend for the first quarter was $88 million or up 11% -- or 11.2% of revenues. This is 110 basis points higher than the prior year spend rate and $9 million higher in dollars. We continue to support new product launches and grew dollar share on 3 of our 4 mega brands in the quarter. And this is due to the great execution of our sales and marketing teams.","Now SG&A. SG&A year-over-year was lower by $12.3 million in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.5%. This is approximately 160 basis point decrease from the prior year first quarter, and this is in part due to the absence of transition expenses related to the Avid acquisition that occurred in the prior year first quarter, as well as lower legal costs.","This is a reflection of our continued vigilance to control SG&A. And you may remember, when we gave our outlook for the full year, that we are expecting 2014 full year op margin expansion to be driven by SG&A, and we got off on the right foot in the first quarter.","Now operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 20.7%, which was 100 basis points lower than last year's 21.7%. But again, this reflects our investment behind the new products.","Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 34.5%. This compares to last year's 34% or 50 basis points higher year-over-year. Remember that the Q1 2013 rate was favorably affected by retroactive reinstatement of R&D credits last year. We expect the full year 2014 effective rate to be approximately 34.5%.","Next, I'll comment on cash. We generated $102 million of net cash from operations for the first 3 months of 2014. This is a $30 million increase over last year, where we spent $6.3 million in CapEx in the quarter, and it's a $4 million decrease from the prior year. On a full year basis, we expect to spend approximately $85 million on CapEx.","I'm going to comment on share buybacks next, but I'm going to preface my comments on the share buybacks with just a comment on cash flow. We expect full year cash from operations to exceed $525 million in 2014. That will be a record for us, so we did deploy some of that cash in the first quarter. The company purchased 260 million through ASRs in Q1. You may recall, in February, at CAGNY, we said we repurchased 140 million of shares. And since then, we did an additional 120 million for a total of 260 million.","And the way to think about the 260 million, of the 260 million, approximately 75 million was purchased under our Evergreen program, which is established to cover share creep. And the balance, 185 million, was purchased under our $500 million share repurchase program. So we have $350 million remaining under that authorization, and the company anticipates purchasing additional shares in 2014.","I'm going to wrap up right now. The first quarter results include 1.2% organic sales growth with a 4% EPS decline, as we invested behind the launch of our new products. We expect second quarter earnings of approximately $0.61 per share, which is the same as the prior year.","I'm sure many would have liked EPS to be higher. However, our plans for our new products require a significant increase in marketing spending, so we expect Q2 to be the highest quarter of the year for marketing spend.","A couple other comments. As we mentioned in the release, Q2 organic sales is expected to be 3% in the second quarter, and gross margin is expected to contract 100 basis points. And again, this is primarily influenced by the remaining slotting investments and also more price competition in the laundry category.","I'll turn it back to you now, Jim.","James R. Craigie","Thanks, Matt. I'll finish up our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the full year. As stated in the press release, we have updated our 2014 guidance to reflect the organic sales growth at the lower end of our 3% to 4% range, and we've tightened our earnings per share growth to 7% to 9%. These results, we've driven by our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of our innovative new products, aggressive productivity programs and tight management overhead costs.","Our 7% to 9% earnings growth target is a tighter band than our initial 6% to 10% earnings growth target, but is still in the upper quartile of EPS growth targets in the CPG industry, consistent with our historical performance. And we believe we can deliver within that aggressive range despite the highly competitive environment and weak U.S. consumer demand.","The majority of our annual earnings growth is planned to occur in the second half of the year, since the first half includes a significant increase in slotting, couponing, trade promotions and incremental advertising for our new product launches versus what we've spent last year.","We are also aggressively pursuing acquisitions and a significant financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions, because we are very selective of the type of businesses we acquire.","That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I guess I'll try 2. You're saying your organic sales growth will be 3% in the second quarter, and that's better than the first quarter. Can you break that out to U.S. Consumer versus Specialty? I'm just wondering if that is going to be driven primarily by Specialty. Or will the U.S. Consumer be stronger than in the first quarter? And then my second question is on the SG&A ratio, which is down 150 basis points. And it's normally been, not just last year, but for several years, it's been more around 13% in the first quarter, and now it was 11.5%. Is that you scurrying around and cutting costs as much as you can to make your numbers? Or is the SG&A ratio permanent -- maybe for the whole year, down 150 basis points, and can it continue to go down in the following year?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","That sounded like more than 2 questions, Alice. That's all. With respect to the first question, say, yes, right, in the first quarter, we were up 1.2% for the total company. And as everybody can see in the release, that the Specialty Products business was up significantly, with domestic up 40 basis points and the international business up -- actually flat year-over-year. In the second quarter, we're expecting a similar performance from the Specialty Products business, but that is not going to be enough to drive us to a 3%. My expectation is that the combined Consumer business should grow approximately 2% in the second quarter, and that the -- and that will be U.S. and international, and that the Specialty Products business might generate the rest. Those are round numbers, but that's the way to think about the second quarter. What was -- your next question was on SG&A, or do you have a second one on?","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Well, first, with the 2% for Consumer, is the U.S. going to be up more or less than that 2%?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","No, I wouldn't want to get a bit more granular than that. I think that the combined will be up 2% approximately.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes, and then the other would be SG&A ratio.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. So SG&A, so in the first quarter, you saw we were down 160 basis points year-over-year. And we called out a couple of things that happened in the quarter. One would be the Avid transition expenses. So of that 160, 40 that was attributed to those 2, so 120 for the rest. I don't think it should be any surprise to anybody. We expect SG&A to drive our op margin expansion this year. Because remember, when we started the year, what we said was that we have flat gross margin and pretty much flat marketing, right? So we'd said 45% gross margin and 12.5% marketing, with all of our op margin expansion coming from SG&A. So that is as expected, and I wouldn't use the word scurrying around, there's not a lot of scurrying around here. We have a pretty tight plan with respect to where we're going to get to that save year-over-year, so we do expect that on a full year basis. We're going to be down probably over 100 basis points. So you probably sit in there trying to figure out how you're going to get to the midpoint of the range, and you work on your model. So I'll save everybody a lot of trouble. So if you're saying, \"All right, the company said, the low end of the 3% to 4% range, but -- so then you'd be anywhere. Let's pick 3% organic sales just for fun.\" And we'll say organic -- we said gross margin was going to be 50 to 75 basis points down, so let's say down 60. That will mean your SG&A have to be down around 150 basis points to get 50 basis points of op margin expansion on a full year basis.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","How about the marketing ratio for the year?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Say again?","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Will the marketing ratio for the year still be flat or...","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, yes. So in my -- the way I'm talking you through it is, is if you had the low end of the range of 3%, and you picked the midpoint of that gross margin around 60 down; kept marketing where it was, 12.5%; and you say, \"Okay, SG&A, down 110.\" That math gets you to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. So -- and clearly, we have -- well on our way with respect to how the first quarter panned out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you guys have a great history of delivering the double-digit earnings growth historically. I know you're pretty proud of that history. I'm just wondering if -- as we think about this year and the high single-digit earnings growth, it seems like it's a pretty ambitious goal in light of the current competitive environment and clearly, repurchases and SG&A leverage are helping you drive that earnings growth. So I guess, it feels like you're stretching a bit more to hit goals. Is that a fair point? And also, as you think about the strong innovation pipeline, how do you kind of marry the need to invest behind the pipeline for stronger growth beyond this year versus potentially depressing EPS growth by investing behind that strong pipeline this year?","James R. Craigie","I would tell you to kind of think of this year as a year where we're investing for the future and yet, still delivering an earnings per share growth that I think is at the upper end of the industry. So I kind of look at it as a win-win. We always want to be in that top quartile in earnings growth. In this case, we're below 10%. So if it wasn't for foreign exchange, we'll be in double digits, but we're slightly below 10%. But more importantly, we're investing in the future with all the great new products and the strong advertising support. I would tell you to keep in mind, some of our competitors are actually cutting advertising. Procter's announced last year, they're going to cut $1 billion out of their marketing spending. And we're keeping our marketing spending strong. And we also told you previously, we're actually focusing that a little bit before -- more behind our 4 big mega brands. So we're very excited with the fact we got the best new product pipeline we've ever had this year. We're investing behind it. That's why the first quarter and the second quarter are down or flat versus EPS. So we've expect some very strong growth in the back half of the year. But investments is the right way to think about it, but still delivering very strong earnings growth compared to our competition.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the repurchase front, 260 million this quarter is a big step-up from recent trends. So can you talk about what changed here to make you more aggressive on that front? And does it signal at all that acquisitions are less likely? Because it didn't sound like that based on the commentary, but I'd love to get an update there.","James R. Craigie","No, I wouldn't say that acquisitions are unlikely. And with respect to share repurchase, the high watermark for the company in the past was around $250 million a few years ago. So we have been at that level before, and it's a way to think about what was built into the numbers and where are we now. So when we start the year, you're faced with question marks about retailer acceptance of our new products, consumer trial, the impact of Simply Tide. FX became topical even for us, even though we were only 20% international. So that's more of an issue for us this year than in prior years. And input costs have also been -- is also a question mark and then you come to share count. So you have some levers that were all in question marks with respect to that wide range of 6% to 10%, which we've now tightened. So our expectation was to purchase shares this year, up to around $250 million. So that's how we started the year, depending how things would go. So that's what we did in 2 pieces, $140 million in February, and we did a little bit more in March, $120 million. And then looking at it right now, we'd say, \"Okay, we have $350 million remaining on our authorization.\" We don't expect to exhaust that, Dara, or even exceed half of the remainder. But we will do some more before the year's out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess I want to delve into a little bit on the consumer side, and maybe if you could talk about what you're seeing with consumer trends, the premium side versus the value side. So the laundry, I know right now, is challenged with some of the external factors. And even I think when you go to some of your key retailers, you're seeing some outrageous promotions out there, good for me, bad for you. But at the same point, with gummy kind of in that double-digit range, can you talk more about the personal care innovation that's coming out this year? Because it kind of feels like on the consumer side, maybe this is the swing factor to kind of delivering better than what you thought. Last year's innovation, I thought, was good. But excluding Avid, it only grew like very low single digits. So can you talk a little bit about that and how much of that is a bifurcation between premium and kind of the value consumer?","James R. Craigie","Yes, I'll be glad to, Jason. First of all, when you look at the first quarter results, we're in roughly 14 categories, and half of them were down, the half were up. So that's not great. We wish it was -- more than half were up. We're excited about the personal care side of our portfolio this year. We've got some great new products. Our FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits have -- the first and only pregnancy kit that tells you 6 days before your missed period. Every time, it's gone up a day, the first guy to have it usually benefits the category, so that's very premium-priced. So that's just launched, we're excited. On Nair, we have a whole new line of products going out under Argan oil, new moisturizer on the products, new ingredient. That's hitting market and off to a great start. On the vitamins, we launched a vitamin-plus line on both the kids side and the adult side. That's, again, got better-than-average company margins on it. We expect that to do very well and drive double-digit sales growth this year. Oral care is probably the best year we've had in a long time. We have a whole new line going out under the Truly Radiant name for both toothpaste and toothbrushes. It's got great new distribution. Our early share results are up there, and we're very excited about that. We had a lady -- the TV talk show, The Biggest Loser, who is our spokesperson. The ads are terrific, and that product's off to a very good start. And that's, again, all premium-priced products. And then TROJAN, we have some new condoms, vibrators and lubricants going out, again, very high-premium price in terms of margin in that. So now we've got a very strong portfolio on the personal care side of the world. And also, we told you before, the household side, the cat litter is our star for the moment because it's out the earliest and doing great, but we have new laundry detergent forms. OxiClean, as you know, which is, prior to the company average margins, has got lot of tough stuff out there. The laundry detergent, new bleach-like product, new dish-washing product out there. So our guns are loaded. We're supporting it. The advertising's very strong. And Matt told you before, the second quarter advertising is going to be the highest of any quarter of the year to drive the trial, and we've done stuff on the pricing side, as I say, to make sure we're competitive.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on that point about you saying the marketing in the second quarter is the highest, is that dollar or percentage of sales? And does that imply, I guess, based on Alice's question that the second half marketing spending will be down year-over-year just on the comparisons?","James R. Craigie","Yes. So we got a front end -- it's more front-end loaded, right? So it's pretty much both on the percentages and the dollars that's been the highest for the year for Q2. And that means, obviously, we're pulling things forward to get behind the new product launches.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then just a housekeeping, just with the buybacks, can you provide any color in terms of where we should model share count for the second quarter and just to the full year?","James R. Craigie","Yes, on a full year basis, where we are right now, it's round numbers, be 139 million shares, and you can -- for average shares on a full year -- if you want to use a full year weighted average number.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So then for the second quarter, we're looking for something in the high 130s then?","James R. Craigie","Yes. I just want to make sure that you understand it. So where -- when I say where we are right now, we bought back $260 million worth of shares, so your round number denominator would be 139 million shares to calculate EPS. And I already commented on how much more we might buy for the remainder of the year, so you can do the math on that and you adjust the 139 million downward.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right, but in terms of incremental, what you might buy, is that in your guidance of 7% to 9% or not?","James R. Craigie","Yes.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's in your guidance? Okay.","James R. Craigie","Right, but it's a range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions on the laundry category. You mentioned that it was down 5% in the first quarter. Can you remind us what that number was in the fourth quarter in terms of the category decline?","James R. Craigie","The total laundry category, including liquid powder and the unit dose, was down about 2.9% in the fourth quarter last year. And I believe the number, we're pulling it right now is -- because we often confuse liquid and everything else like that. I'm sorry, it was down 2.2% in the fourth quarter, and it was down 3.9% in the first quarter of this year, all types of laundry products.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, so a meaningful deceleration there. In terms of Tide Simply, curious what you're seeing from the impact, from that launch at this point? Is it still too early to tell, or are you seeing much in a way of any share loss there?","James R. Craigie","Yes, it's too early to tell, Joe. There's a lot going on with the category. Our new product launches, the couponing and trade spending by some of our competitors has clouded the water a little bit like that. It's just too early to tell. We're very happy we got incremental distribution on both our ARM & HAMMER and OxiClean laundry products. And now we started to drive quality, increase advertising and the trade and coupon spending.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one last one on Avid. I guess, the VMS category did slow down a little bit in the fourth quarter. There were some negative articles being written, I guess. Have you seen that category start to accelerate again in the first quarter? Or is that going to take a couple of quarters before that plays out?","James R. Craigie","Yes. No, you're right. There was some press out there that unfortunately got blown out of sight. The press was very narrow -- or actually, the studies done were very narrow about -- focusing on cardiovascular disease and cancer. The newspeople in the world kind of expanded that to be some very broad headlines that multivitamins weren't effective. So it caused a bit of dent in the category. We're happy and fortunate that we're on the growth side of the category, and we have some incredible -- with the gummy side of the business which has been and will continue to be the growth part of the business. So I think the category will respond. We did a lot of due diligence when we bought this business, and we were warned by the people in this business that these kind of things will happen. They'll be relatively short lived and the things go back. So I think there'll be a pretty quick bounce back in the category on this. As most people take vitamins to supplement their nutritionary [ph] needs, and most people have gaps in their nutrient needs, so I think this bad press will quickly pass through and the category will start growing again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was intrigued by the other press release you guys put out this morning, talking about Walmart's initiative on sustainability and the implications potentially on laundry compaction. Can you talk about how that's progressing in your dialogue with Walmart, what you expect going to go forward and what the implications could be for your business?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Jason. Yes, that's late-breaking news. We are very happy to see Walmart announce that initiative of at least 25% compaction by 2018. We're very strongly behind all this. We think it's great for the environment, and we'll be working very closely with Walmart to make this happen as soon as possible.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When they talk about compaction, do you think that includes the unit dose, or is that just referring to traditional liquid?","James R. Craigie","They're referring to traditional liquid.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And lastly, on unit dose, it continues to capture more and more share of the overall category, with liquid really driving it. Any plans for you to get into the liquid unit dose category?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, Jason. I would take the question. What you said -- it's -- the category kind of flattened out around 8%. Procter launched their Gain version of it, called Gain flings. And so the unit dose is up to about 10%, and it's kind of flattening out there. So I think that's where we're going to see the category plateau at, and I don't care to comment about what we do in terms of new products in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had 2 follow-up questions, and I'm not sure if I just misunderstood. But on the guidance for the revenue growth for the back half, 2 things. The reduction was sort of leaning towards the low end of the previous guidance. That's all a price mix issue. And so if you had given us volume expectations for the year, that would be unchanged. Is that right?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, I can tell you what the expectations are for the year.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, the question is -- you're saying it's a more competitive environment, but does that mean that you expect less market share expansion or less category growth on the volume side?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","I'm not sure I follow your question.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You're effectively lowering your top line, and I'm trying to understand why.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, we said that there's unprecedented price competition in the laundry -- our laundry category, so that's influencing the full year call.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that's affecting your market share outlook or your pricing outlook?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","It's pricing, not market share. As Jim said earlier...","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So your volume outlook for the year hasn't changed?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Say again? Our share outlook for the year hasn't changed.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And your volume, your underlying volume growth outlook for the year hasn't changed?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","That's correct, that's correct.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And my second question is, if the full year revenue growth, let's say, is going to be 3% on an organic basis, but it's only looking like it's kind of 1.5% to 2% in the first half, why exactly it's going to accelerate in the back half? Because I would think all of your new product shipments are actually happening in the first half.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. Just kind of remember, we -- even in the first quarter, we had a 200 basis points drag on our top line organic, because of year-over-year incremental slotting and couponing. So all of that is -- it happens in the first couple of quarters of the year. And the absence of that have been -- that you remove that boat anchor in the second half.","James R. Craigie","Right. And the great trial we're driving behind all the great new products will pay off more in the second half of the year without the drag of the coupon and slotting cost, which heavily hit the first half. All that is netted in our sales numbers in the first few quarters.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So but for the back half of the year, you're looking for organic revenue growth close to 4%?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, that's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, 2 more questions related to the laundry category. Aside from it being more -- there'd be more competition, more price intensity, is there -- has anything else surprised you in terms of the nature of that competition, who's driving it, which companies, which brands beyond Simply year-to-date? I guess...","James R. Craigie","Yes. I would say my perspective on it. It wasn't really a total surprise. I've been concerned about this happening for a while. As you know, the weak economy that we've had since 2009 has encouraged consumers in a lot of categories to trade down. We took advantage of that behind our great line of value detergents and some launching -- by launching great new products, increasing advertising support, particularly in ARM & HAMMER. That's led to 5 straight years of share gains for us on ARM & HAMMER. And now, like we've told you before, we're now the #2 laundry detergent company. So our competitors were getting frustrated. We saw that. I feel P&G kind of through the match in the gas by launching a half-priced version of Tide. We responded to that with innovations. We had a whole new line of all ARM & HAMMER pods [ph] called Clean Scentsations out there, and we launched the OxiClean laundry detergent. But unfortunately, a couple of our competitors, namely Henkel and Sun, responded by lowering some feature prices and dropping a lot more coupons at higher values out there. We would never lead such tactics, but we'll be competitive. So we responded to that in the second half of the year to support our targets, and that's where it is. But I think we are doing the right thing and -- by driving innovation initially and -- but like I said, we will not be uncompetitive.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess related to it, the second part is, what are your retailer counterparts saying related to all this price investment? I guess, their margins are benefiting from the trade spend, but category growth obviously is suffering. So what's their perspective on it? Are they getting frustrated as well? Is there pressure from that constituency to alter the game?","James R. Craigie","I think it's a good -- great question. I think it's too early to call that. Don't forget, there's 2 parts to it. They -- the retailers see the trade promotion dollars, and that affects their same-store dollar [ph] range, and that drives some of the category. What's not captured by the retailers, they don't get affected by it or by the categories, all the coupons. And all the coupons that are dropped through the papers and that have been pretty huge. Again, the retailer is immune from that because that doesn't affect the selling price that they get. So it's kind of a mixed bag there, but it certainly isn't good. We said in an earlier answer, the category was starting to rebound in the fourth quarter of last year, and we're rather excited about that and looking forward to a year being driven by innovation, and then the competitive actions to lower prices has kind of hurt the category short term. And I don't know how long it will last. I'm not sure. But we have the firepower to stay competitive on this to deliver our targets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Can you tell me a little bit more -- just on the gross margin side, you're taking out the pricing, marketing mix. Are there other initiatives going on? I mean, would you -- excluding that, see some meaningful gross margin expansion and maybe talk about it, we've exhausted everything out of Victorville? Or are there other initiatives on the horizon? And the kind of the commodity outlook, is that a headwind, a tailwind, any change in the quarter?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, Bill. The -- with respect to the gross margin, the types of things, you get all the fanfare and the headlines are new plants. We built the York plant, and we built the Victorville plant. But even aside from that, we always have programs in place to expand gross margin, because we're always dealing with inflation year-over-year. So that continues to be a hallmark of the organization. So I wouldn't say that absent building plants, that we wouldn't -- going to have continued to focus and have meaningful initiatives in place over the next 3 years, so it will help us expand gross margin.","James R. Craigie","Yes, but I would chime in too. Keep in mind things we've heard about that are coming through the benefits are. We put a cat litter line into our York plant about a year ago, and that's paying huge benefits. And we're in the process of putting expanded capacity in for our gummy vitamin plant into our York facility, and that'll generate cost savings too. So we have good projects ahead of us. We have a 3-year pipeline of Good to Great savings we call ahead of us. So it's always been a hallmark to the company. We're extremely aggressive about it. It's in our -- it's in the -- 25% of everyone's bonus at this company is based on hitting the gross margin improvement targets. So a lot of focus on and around here and a great pipeline of projects and some big -- that includes some big projects.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the compaction question, I know Walmart said by 2017, 2018. If it was sooner, like say 2015, when would you hear about it, and how quickly could kind of convert to that?","James R. Craigie","Bill, this is honestly late breaking news that's just come out there. Like I said, we totally support it. We believe it could happen sooner and bigger, but we have to work all that out with Walmart in that. So that's all to be seen. It's just late breaking news and we're again, just very -- we've always been a big supporter of compaction, and we will be in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the lind of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division","This is Brian Doyle in for Caroline. I just had one on laundry. Within the ARM & HAMMER brand, specifically, I was wondering how much of an offset, even though it was down, how much of an offset was the new product line, and whether that will be maybe a bigger help over the balance of the year? And then my second question was just kind of on the model, bridging the 5% or mid-single digit EBIT growth to 7% to 9% on EPS. Is that largely -- I mean, I realize share count is doing a lot of the work there, but I was wondering if there's any other benefit from either the equity earnings or other income line that you're also expecting there.","James R. Craigie","Yes, Brian, I'll take the first one. If I recall that my number's right, the ARM & HAMMER brands, liquid laundry detergent share went up about 0.5 share point in the first quarter, and the new line, the new product line called Clean Scentsations, I believe, delivered about 0.7% share growth. So you can see it drove all the share growth and then some on the brand in the first quarter. Second question, let me toss that one to Matt?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Well, your question on -- your second question is with respect to if you wanted to get to the midpoint of the range, back to my earlier comments, what the impact of the line item JV and other income and interest expense would be?","Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Yes, just whether those 2 would get any better.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","I don't they're not going to get any better. I think on a full year basis, I think a good estimate would be probably $6 million to $8 million improvement year-over-year.","Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division","On a combined basis?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes, all in, JV, other interest.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. First, given that competition is accelerating and macros are getting a bit tougher, can you talk about what gives you confidence that things do improve in the second half? And how much of your changes sort of the lower end of the plus 3 is due to the category growth rates? I assume that if I heard you correctly, you expect your market share assumptions haven't changed. So is it all category growth rates? And maybe you could elaborate a little bit on that.","James R. Craigie","Yes. We're in a lot of categories. But overall, I would say we've always planned for the worst and hoped for the best. So we don't expect much improvement in the care category growth rates, much at all. We are -- our plan is heavily driven by the innovations driving improved share results. As I told you, our first big one out the door, that's -- the first market grows [ph] on cat litter, the results are spectacular to date, and we hope to see similar results like that because we think we have a great new product line. They've been tested thoroughly with consumers, consumers love them and we're putting our money where our mouth is in terms of spending to drive, first, the distribution in terms of slotting fees and now the trial with advertising and couponing and trade support behind them. So we're not counting much on all about category improvement. If that happens, that's terrific, but we're mostly driving the share of our products through our great new product innovations.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then on the second half, talk a little bit more about what gives you confidence beyond the new products, given that the environment just gotten a whole lot tougher.","James R. Craigie","Well, first, I would say 2. We're holding up our advertising spending to where it was a year ago. And the word we have, our tracking measures all show is that almost all of our competitors have cut their advertising spending. So we expect our share of voice in the marketplace to switch. It always -- we measure our advertising spending by to be greater than our share of market, and that's the formula that we've had in the past and will be in the future to drive your business results. So we expect to be very competitive and actually be driving growth of our brands through our strong advertising spending. And then you put that behind a great new pipeline of products and you got it. So -- and our sales force has done an excellent -- the incremental distribution we got was tremendous. So again, the whole thing about Q1, the first step was getting incremental distribution, we got it. Q2, we're turning on the gas in terms of marketing spending, we got it. And I just think that's a great formula that'll kick in. And as Matt said in the second half of the year, we get relief from the fact of all the slotting fees and that, that we spent in the first half go away to help drive the gross margin which gets into the net selling prices positive. So this is an age-old formula, but it works and we do it very well and it starts with the great new products and then executing. And we've got a great sales force and marketing team to execute on it. And it's done it before, and we think it'll do it again.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, like this laundry battle that's going on right now, is this like an all Friday, is this a conflict that will last a couple months or is this just like a full-out war? Because you go back to historical battles like this, even the cereals stuff in like the '90s, and it was like a 2- or 3-year period where people got really stupid. And there's no end game, all it was sort of like zero sum and this like trajectory down. So yes, maybe some commentary on how long you think it will last and like what the sort of end game is for everybody to kind of do this?","James R. Craigie","Yes, Bill. I really -- I mean, I don't control that all. Obviously, I just had my side of it. I don't know. I can say one point of view that the actions by the competitors were simply to take their users out of the marketplace before our great new products hit and some of the Procter products hit, so it could've been a short-term defensive action to just try to pull aside their users. But as I've said to you before, if they want to continue this out, we will not lead it. But we'll be right there with them, competitive, and we'll see what happens. And I really can't go any further [indiscernible] issue for both competitive and legal reasons.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And so -- I mean, would you go nuclear [ph] though and then abandon the EPS algorithm if it kind of persisted?","James R. Craigie","I would never do that.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just a follow-up. I'm trying to do 2 questions in one so you don't hang up on me. These OTC deals like the Merck, Bayer -- the Bayer thing, I'm not sure they want the sun care and Dr. Scholl's business there. Was that something you guys would be interested in at all? And then lastly, how much of that SG&A reduction is going to be reversed in incentive compensation accruals? Because I know gross margin is a big component of your payout and obviously, you're not going to hit it this year.","James R. Craigie","Yes. Bill, on M&A, you know we can't comment on things like that. We have very defined criteria for finding deals and looking for products that are #1 or 2 or in their categories. And the higher gross margin in our category, have future growth capability, NRIs and have -- asset light, that's what we prefer. That's what we comb the marketplace for. We're very aware of everything going on out there. So we're always open at looking at stuff and we'll make judgments, but I hope the Street and our shareholders respect the fact we're very diligent and disciplined about how we look at acquisitions, and we'll continue to be that way. So that's, that.","Matthew Thomas Farrell","Yes. Your other question that was probably for the benefit of the 3,500 employees that are listening, incentive comp...","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","[indiscernible]","Matthew Thomas Farrell","It's a little -- you remember, we have 4 components to our incentive comp, right, sales, gross margin, EPS and cash. And as we pointed out in the release, expected a record year for free cash flow or cash from operations, I should say. So look, it's still early, Bill. So we wouldn't be making comments on that at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My question relates to Avid. Jim, you traded your double-digit sales growth outlook for that business for the full year in your prepared remarks, and you called out specifically significant distribution gains. I wonder, what are these, as yet untapped distribution opportunities then that you still have? And is that really the main driver of the business' growth at this point?","James R. Craigie","Thanks, Michael. It's not -- it's one of the key drivers. We bought this business. We saw that it was way underdeveloped in terms of distribution. The company we bought it from was a wonderful little family company. They didn't have a lot the resources. They largely had one salesperson. That person largely coverages 5 accounts, and they didn't have the time to get out to the hundreds of other accounts out there, particularly in the food and drug trade. So we have a full-scale sales force supported by brokers, and we have leveraged that to get the full product line out there in all channels of distribution in that. So that's been a big plus, but also, we've been -- I told you we doubled the advertising last year. We're going to take it up at least north of 30% this year. We're putting out new product lines on both the kids and the adults, and we're doing -- driving tons of trials through sampling in that, because our -- the big opportunity for us is really on the adult side. We already have over a 50% share of the kids business. And the adult side, we're #1, but in the share position, but the issue is it's a very small piece, like it's only 6% of all adult vitamins out there. And I think the adult category is 20x the size of the kids category. So -- and our view, it's more like Coca-Cola, there's -- only x percent of the world drinks colas. We look at the fact that only 6% of adults who use vitamins use gummy vitamins. So we believe the upside is 94% to go because I haven't found one person ever in my life who's tasted a gummy vitamin and hasn't preferred it to the hard pill they take. So we're just all about that. It's great upside we're chasing with the -- getting the distribution out there, getting the advertising, getting more new products out there and driving that. So it's -- we love the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just one question. Could you just discuss the strategy of taking Oxydol -- sorry, OxiClean into 3 new categories this year, in auto, dish and bleach, as well as detergent? And why you didn't choose to keep it to detergent this year with maybe greater focus on it on it? I'd like to get your perspective.","James R. Craigie","Yes. Thanks, Connie. Yes, OxiClean is probably -- there are -- of all the brands we have, we have over 80, but of all the brands we have, it probably has the greatest consumer loyalty than any brand we have. People just rave about OxiClean. I told you to start with there's been nothing but gaining share in the laundry additives category, bigger than the next 4 players involved, and those next 4 players include people like P&G and Reckitt and we just keep growing it. We saw that loyalty. We actually did, 2 years ago, go into the dish-wash additive category over there. It did quite well, which proved -- that had license to expand the dish-washing, all behind the brand. The brand is an -- the incredible strength of that brand is fighting stains, which are key in these sort of 2 other categories. Obviously, fighting stains was key in laundry because we're the #1 laundry additive, and we just saw -- as we just saw -- we saw a hole. We thought that people weren't really talking about that laundry detergents. What they're all focused on other things on the side, and we just thought we're the kings of fighting stains. We thought we have the right to take that into a full-scale laundry detergent because the additives aren't used by everybody out there. So that made a logical choice to go do that. Like I'd said we tested our toes into the auto dish world 2 years ago, got great results as auto dish additive, so we went there. And the bleach, well, where we are today, the additive side, is very close cousin to the bleach. We often say on our own advertising, we're better than bleach because you don't run the risk of staining clothes if you accidentally have bleach in there with colored clothes. So that was a natural for us. So we just see this brand as our next great mega brand, and we thought, \"Let's just take it all at once in these categories,\" and made total sense for as far as with the equity of that brand is, which is great stain fighting and just pound that home into logical extensions. We tested the depth, it made total sense. The products are terrific. Consumers love it, and we just let it loose this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm going to head back to M&A, I guess ask it from a little different angle, Jim. I guess, so you still, I guess, sound a bit less bullish than you did going back to CAGNY. I guess, maybe you can talk a little bit about the pipeline. I guess, we spoke during the quarter, and you said some M&A, some of the valuation multiples from an M&A perspective seem, I guess, a bit full, given what the implied multiple is from Merck's consumer health assets, at least in terms of being reported. So I guess, a, kind of what are you seeing? Are you more or less bullish than you were back in February? I know the multiple is still looking a little bit stretched from an M&A perspective.","James R. Craigie","Kevin, I really can't say much. I would just say I think you see, overall, the M&A market is heating up out there with lots of deals happening. That's generally a positive thing, because sometimes, companies buy other things, they don't want the entire portfolio, and we bought brands in the past off that. But we're always looking, always scouring, but I'll go back to what I said a few minutes ago. We're very diligent and disciplined about this. I mean, we are protectors of the shareholders' capital, and we have sets of rules we follow and we're doing -- I just promise you, we're looking everywhere and looking for the right deal. And when the time's right and everything else is right, we'll make that deal. We have plenty of firepower, even with the share buybacks. So we're in a position to have our cake and eat it too as far as buying back the shares we've done and still have the firepower to make a big acquisition.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And how high would you take the debt leverage? And would you be willing to issue equity for the right deal?","Matthew Thomas Farrell","I think that would be very unusual for us to issue equity. As Jim said, that we have the ability to borrow a significant amount of debt and up -- over $2 billion of debt and still be able to hold on to our credit rating. And by the way, the share buyback is not being funded by debt. That's being paid completely out of -- starting the year with $500 million of cash and generating close to $300 million of cash after dividends and CapEx. So we have a great ability to lever up and maintain our BBB+ credit rating, largely because historically, what we do is we do take the leverage ratio up, we immediately direct all of our free cash flow to reduce our leverage ratio and the rating agencies are well aware of that practice, and we would follow it again in the future.","James R. Craigie","Okay. Folks, I have an Analyst Shareholders Meeting coming up here shortly. So I want to thank you for your time this morning. I just want to leave you with a message. We're very excited. First quarter is right on track for us. We accomplished what we want to do in getting all of our great new products out there and a great distribution, and we're all set up to continue that momentum into the back 3 quarters of the year here and right on track to make our targets, so very excited. Year of innovation, think about innovation, we've got the best innovation portfolio out there, and we're putting our money behind -- where our mouth is and supporting it. So we feel very confident in making our targets. So thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company\u2019s SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","Jim Craigie","It's always a pleasure to talk to you particularly when we have outstanding results to report. I will start of this call by providing you with my perspective on our first quarter business results which you read about in our press release this morning. I will then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter.","When Matt is finished I will return to provide some detailed information on the performance of our key brands and to discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We will then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I'm very happy with the first quarter business results. We told you in February that we exited 2011 with strong momentum as reflected in our 7% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We continue that momentum in the first quarter of 2012 by delivering 8% organic revenue growth, our highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2008. ","This outstanding organic revenue growth was driven by a 10% growth in our domestic business and 7% growth in our international business. The 10% organic growth in our domestic business was driven largely by 14% growth in our household business. Behind strong growth in our value-based fabric care business and innovative product news in our cat litter business. Our sales results are down slightly for our premium priced personal care brands due largely to the weak or declining category trends.","However we gained market share on key power brands such as Trojan which achieved the second-highest quarterly share ever and first response which gained a full share point. These share gains should pay big dividends when the economic improves because we expect this category to return to historical growth rates. We also told you in February that we expected a lower gross margin in the first quarter of last year due to the continuing year-over-year domestic makes.","However we are making progress on this front as the gross margin for the first quarter of 2012 was 50 basis points above the fourth quarter of 2011. The first quarter results also reflect that we tighten our belts on overhead costs, as SG&A as a percent of sales improved by 40 basis points. Don't be concerned about the lower marketing spending in Q1 and it is simply a function of timing. It was only a $1 million or roughly 2% below year-ago dollar spend. Also our organic growth was so exceptional from the first quarter at the spending levels that we decided to delay some marketing spending to later quarters where we are going to use more effectively behind new products.","Most importantly we delivered a 13.8% increase in earnings per share which represents a strong start toward our annual EPS target of 9% to 10%. Now please don't start foaming at the mouth and raising our annual EPS target as Matt will surely explain why our 9% 10% annual EPS target is still appropriate. Those of you know me know that I have been a long-term pessimist about the business environment. I believe we will continue to face strong headwinds in 2012 including high commodity costs and weak consumer spending which will perpetuate competitive price for us.","All consumer packages companies are fighting the same headwinds, but we believe that no other CPG company is as well-suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. I will explain my rationale for that statement in a few minutes after Matt provides you with greater insights from the financial results for the first quarter.","Matt Farrell","Thank you, Jim and good morning everybody. I will cover the EPS. First-quarter EPS was $0.66 per share compared with $0.58 in 2011. So EPS was up approximately 14% from a year ago. Reported revenues were up 7.5% to $691 million. Organic sales was 8.4% which excludes the impact of an acquisition and foreign exchange rate changes which together had a negative impact of 50 basis points. Organic sales includes 2011 sales in December resulting from customer orders made in anticipation of our January 2012 US systems upgrade.","That particular adjustment accounted for a 1.4% of the 8.4% organic. The company believes such December sales would have occurred in the first quarter of 2012 where it not for the timing shift. Of the 8.4% organic growth approximately 10.5% is due to volume with 2.1% negative product mix and pricing and mostly product mix. Given our strong start, we now expect to deliver organic sales at the high end of our 3% to 4% annual target for the year.","Now let's review the segments. The consumer domestic business' organic sales increased by 10.1% primarily due to higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent. Other products that contributed to volume growth were XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter and the introduction of ARM & HAMMER CRYSTAL BURST powerpack laundry detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER SpinBrush, Trojan condoms and ORAJEL oral analgesic products.","Volume contributed approximately 3.4% of sales partially offset by the 3.3% negative effect of product mix and price and again mostly product mix. Organic sales includes an estimated 1.7% benefit from the timing shift that I discussed earlier with respect to customer orders from December that were pulled forward into January in anticipation of the US systems upgrade.","Now International. International had 7% organic growth in Q1 due to higher sales in Canada, France, Australia and exports. This increase is driven by volume growth of 8.7% partially offset by 1.5% of product mix and price. For our specialty products division, organic sales were lower by 2.5% with volume down 8.1% and price up 5.6%. The price is driven generally in the animal nutrition business where we are recovering raw material costs. The organic decrease is primarily due to softness in our end markets especially in the dairy markets.","Looking ahead to the balance of the year we now expect to be at the high-end of our 3% to 4% organic growth rate. We expect organic sales to be higher in the first half of 2012 as compared to the second half of 2012 as a result of easier comparisons in the first half. We continue to expect our value products particularly in the laundry category to continue to benefit from the weak economy and deliver strong organic growth.","Now I'm going to cover gross margin. I reported first-quarter gross margin was 43.8% which is a 110 basis point contraction from a year ago. You may call that in February we expected Q1 gross margin to be a replay of Q4 2011 gross margin when gross margin was down year over year a 120 basis points. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to unfavorable product mix as net sales of lower margin consumer domestic household products rose 14.4% and net sales of higher margins consumer domestic personal care products were 2.6% lower.","The other contributor to the contraction is a start-up of the new California plant which is on track to be fully operational in July. What is also noteworthy is that higher commodity costs in the quarter were offset by the effective cost reduction programs.","Gross margin improved by 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Looking ahead first and second quarter, we expect second-quarter gross margin to be comparable for the first quarter due to a continuation of the product mix story. Because of the trend in product mix we expect full-year gross margin expansion to be at the lower end of our 25 to 50 basis point range for 2012.","Our anticipated gross margin improvement is primarily a result of our cost savings programs outpacing commodity increases and product mix. So despite gross margin contraction in the first half we are confident in our ability to hit the lower end of annual 25 to 50 basis point target as a result of the following reasons. One is the absence of first half slotting. So slotting was very front-end loaded this year and larger year over year in the first half versus the first half of last year.","Second is higher mix of personal care in the second half including some of our exciting new personal care products. And then finally cost savings programs are outpacing our cost increases and just some color on those cost savings programs. First one obviously would be the Victorville start up which as I said is going to be fully operational in July. The second is bringing unit dose laundry manufacturing in-house. You may recall that we said in the past to the first half of the year we would be manufacturing the parts out-house versus in-house.","And the third is the benefits of our Simply Saline projects at two of our PC plants, personal care plants, one in the UK and one in the US that we are having lots of success with and those savings will be coming on in the second half of the this year. Then finally approximately two-thirds of our most voluble cost inputs are hedged for the second half of 2012, which gives us greater confidence with respect to our input costs. ","Now I am going to cover marketing. Marketing spend for the first quarter was $68 million or 9.8% of revenues, which is 100 basis points below the prior year spend rate and slightly lower on the dollar spend. In spite of the slightly lower dollar spend, we grew dollar share in five of our eight power brands. This is due to the great execution by our sales and marketing teams. Looking ahead, we expect to increase spending for the balance of the year and now project full year marketing spends to be approximately 13% of sales.","SG&A year-over-year was up $4 million from the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.3%, down 40 basis points from a year ago. The higher SG&A costs in the quarter reflect higher legal costs and costs associated with our information systems upgrades.","For the full year, we expect a reduction of approximately 30 basis points to 13.1% of sales. This is a reflection of our continuous vigilance-to-control costs. With respect to operating profit, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 2.7% and that margin was 30 basis points higher than the prior year 20.4%.","Now, equity in earnings from affiliates. Income from affiliates increased slightly due to the higher income from our joint ventures. On a full year basis, we expect a decrease about 3 million in part due to the start up of our Natronx joint venture. Other income was virtually unchanged in the quarter. We do not anticipate any material changes for the full year as compared to 2011 and income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% compared to last year 36.5%.","The tax rate includes a 220 basis point benefit due to the settlement of an IRS audit. This of course translates into $0.02 of EPS help, but it\u2019s purely timing. We anticipated this settlement to have in sometime in 2012 and we continue to expect the full year effective rate to be approximately 35%. So, no change since February.","Now cash flow. We generated a $114 million of net cash from operations in the quarter which was $34 million higher than last year. We also spend $15 million in CapEx, a large percentage of which was for our California manufacturing distribution facility. If we net those two numbers together we come to approximately $99 million of free cash flow. So, a very strong quarter.","And during the first quarter we purchased approximately 1.9 million shares at the total cost of $19 million. We continue to buy in April and purchased to $110 million or another 2.2 million shares and at this point we do not anticipate any further purchases for the balance of the year.","At quarter end, we had over $230 million of cash on hand and approximately $500 million available credits to our revolver and a commitment to increase that feature should we choose to for an additional $500 million. And I told that to LTM adjusted EBITDA for our bank agreement was approximately 0.5 times. So, clearly an unlevered company.","In conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 8.4% organic sales growth, driven by 10% volume growth, an increase in share of five of our eight power brands and a healthy 20.7% operating margin. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.54 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year. Remember last year\u2019s second quarter included a $0.04 per share tax benefit as a result of New Jersey\u2019s corporate tax reform. If you look at that full year we are expecting a balanced year for EPS when comparing the first half EPS to second half EPS or maintaining our annual earning per share goal of 241 to 243 for the year, which is an increases 14% to 15% over last year\u2019s reported $2.12 and 9% to 10% higher if we exclude the fourth quarter 2011 deferred tax charge. Back to you, Jim.","Jim Craigie","Thanks, Matt. I\u2019ll finish off our call by adding a little color to the outstanding first quarter business result that Matt just took you through and my outlook on the year. Our great first quarter business is also directly linked to seven factors that support my earlier statement that we believe that no other consumer packages company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough business environment.","First, we have the most unique product portfolio in the CPG industry. It consists both premium and value brands which put us in position of pride in any type of economy, as exemplified by our consistently strong EPS growth over the past 10 years. In particular, our value brands representing about 40% of our revenue based, have experience strong growth in this recessionary economy as consumers are making smart choices by switching to and staying with our high quality but lower price brands. A great example of this is the fact that our value based ARM & HAMMER Laundry Detergent business was up double-digit in sales growth in the first quarter and outpaced all the liquid and powdered detergent brands.","We (inaudible) this strong sales and share growth to continue in 2012. So ARM & HAMMER brand becomes a number two liquid laundry detergent brand in America. The second factor which is the key driver of Church & Dwight success is that we have a proven record of our driving our power brand. We have 80 brands but eight of these brands are our power brand that\u2019s showing 80% of our sales and profits.","From 2008 to 2011, we grew market share on these eight power brands in almost 80 % of the quarters. In the first quarter of this year, we grew market share of five our eight power brands. Two key factors for those excellent share results. First, we have effectively reinvested some of the increased profits from a strong growth of our value brands to selectively increase marketing support our eight power brands by a total of a 130 basis points between 2007 and 2011. While our marketing spending was slightly lower in dollar versus year ago in the first quarter of 2012, please keep in mind that we traditionally spend the bulk of our advertising dollars in the second to the fourth quarters to support the launch of our new products. And we do intend to do spend more marketing dollars in the remaining three quarters of 2012 to support continuous share growth on our power brands.","The other factor driving the growth of our power brands is the robust pipeline of new products. Over the past four years, new products delivered about 50% of the company\u2019s organic revenue growth. We plan to ship innovative new products in every key category this year. This fourth delivery of organic growth target is 3% to 4%. We expect these new products to be as successful as new products we introduced over the past four years.","A sample of this new products include a new sensitive skin product on our ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent line has significantly enhanced the brands appeal to the 52% consumer households who have sensitive skin issues. This will help to drive continued growth in ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent business, which has achieved 12 consecutive quarter of growth and continues to grow faster than all other liquid laundry detergents brands.","Another great new product being launched in 2012 is ARM & HAMMER Ultra Last Cat Litter. Every granule of this new Cat Litter is coated with baking soda to deliver long lasting odor control. Ultra Last is off to a great start and follows it\u2019s hugely successful launch of ARM & HAMMER Double Duty Cat Litter line in 2010.","As a result of the steady stream of great new product introductions the ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter brand achieved its all time high quarterly share in the first quarter and has now achieved 33 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, 12 consecutive quarters of share gain and is now the clear number two brand in pumping cat litter business and is closing in on number one. That's pretty impressive for our category which we entered only 14 years ago. It also shows a strong consumer [POP] ARM & HAMMER brand which now accounts for over $1 billion in total sales.","On the personal care side of our business we have several exciting new products in 2012. First is our new toothpaste for sensitive teeth which combines two of our power brands, ARM & HAMMER and ORAJEL to provide maximum pain relief in a lower bracing formula that is gentle on enamel.","Another new product in the oral care category is TOOTH TUNES which provide manual toothbrushes for young children and uses proprietary technology to place two minutes of music from a broad range of artists. This product will begin shipping in the second half of 2012. For those of you with young children, I guarantee that if they use a TOOTH TUNES toothbrush you will have to yell at your kids to stop brushing instead of yelling at them to brush. TOOTH TUNES represents our first entry in the $800 million manual toothbrush category.","We are also pursuing two other high margin wide space categories to help drive the company's future growth. First is a Vibrator category which is over $500 million in size with no major brand and players. We first entered this category in 2005 with electronics TROJAN brand and this year we are launching full size vibrators in the new channels.","Second we have entered the dish washing additives category which is over $100 million in size via the OXICLEAN brand. The government mandated removal of phosphates from dish washing detergents and is thus created a need for a Booster product to deal with a notable increase in ceramic glasses and dishes. Our new OXICLEAN dish washing Booster product Booster Clean for our dishwashing detergents that once again deliver crystal clear dishware.","There are many other new products that we are launching in 2012, but in the interest of time I will move out with my review of the factors driving switching to our continued success and discuss our updated earnings guidance on the year.","Let me quickly run through five of the key factors of our success. Number three is we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands as evidenced by our successful defense of the OXICLEAN brand when a large competitive entered the category two years ago.","The fourth factor behind our continued success is the strong growth in our international business; while our international business represents only 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high single digit sales growth and double digit operating profit growth over the past five years.","This strong growth continued in the first quarter as Matt mentioned earlier.","Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding growth margins through cost optimization programs, supply chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher margin new products.","We expanded gross margin by 1,550 basis points in the past 10 years. We did not improve our gross margins in 2010 and 2011; we were successful in holding on to 380 of the 430 basis points gain we achieved in 2009 despite major headwinds from commodity costs.","As Matt told you earlier, our gross margin declined 110 basis points from the first quarter, but that was in line with our expectations and 50 basis points above the prior quarter. We have initiatives in place to achieve our gross margin target of 25 to 50 basis points improvement in 2012 although the strong household mix may drive it to the lower end of that range. And we are picking longer term actions to drive continued gross margin growth in future years.","For example, as Matt told you in late May, we began production of new manufacturing facility is Southern California. This plant will enable us to look forward to continuing strong volume growth of both our Liquid Laundry and Cat Litter businesses, and position these businesses to be among the industry leaders in low-cost production and distribution.","Factor number six is our ability to tightly manage our overhead costs. Church & Dwight currently has the highest revenue per employee of any major Consumer Packages Company. As mentioned earlier, our overhead costs were down 40 basis points from the first quarter versus year ago which reflects how aggressively we manage our overhead costs to stay best-in-class in our industry.","Finally, factor number seven is our strong record on free cash flow conversion. We\u2019ve almost quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. Over the past five years, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income was 128%, which was best-in-class in our industry.","As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we continue to improve in the first quarter as our free cash flow was 36% above year ago. This cash flow and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain including construction of more efficient new plants and acquisitions of higher margin and faster growing leading brands.","All these factors give me great confidence of our ability to deliver our aggressive 2012 business targets despite a very tough business environment facing all companies these days.","In my biased opinion, no other Consumer Packages Company is well suited as Church & Dwight to thrive in any type of business environment. We were delivering exceptional earnings per share growth before the recession; we are delivering exceptional earning per share growth during the recession and we are taking actions to ensure that we continue to deliver exceptional earning per share growth going forward regardless of the future economic environment.","Let me switch gears now and simply talk about our outlook for the rest of 2012. As stated in the press release, as a result of the fact that our first quarter results were strong, we remain confident that we can deliver our previously announced earnings per share estimate of $2.41 to $2.43, which is an increase of 9% to 10% over 2011 adjusted earning per share. We strongly believe that we can deliver this aggressive EPS targets just like continued expected headwinds on higher commodity costs and weaker consumer demand.","Our confidence delivering these aggressive targets is based on two key factors. First, we strongly believe that we can deliver the market share gains in our power brands to deliver our target of 3% to 4% organic growth. These share gains are expected to result from our innovative new products, significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands and consistent marketing support. All three of these factors have contributed to continued organic growth. But the growth will not be as strong in the second half of 2012 because it will be up against stronger getting sales in the second half of 2011.","Second we strongly believe we can deliver gross margin expansion of 25 to basis points despite being down 110 basis points in Q1, although that mix may drive us to the lower end of the range. Our gross margin expansion is expected to result from the factors that Matt mentioned earlier. And keep in mind that we\u2019ll be clomping over gross margins in the back half of 2011 that were lower than the front half.","Three, other points that I would like to make before I turn the call over to questions. First, achieving our 2012 EPS target is not depended upon making an acquisition. We aggressively pursued a lot of acquisition opportunities over the past year. We have not been able to find a major acquisition at the right price that meets our acquisition criteria.","Second, I want to assure you that we are fully aware of the threat posed by competitive marketing initiatives and new products being launched by our competitors in the second half of 2012. As I told you earlier, Church & Dwight\u2019s greatest strength is in the building and ferociously defend our brand. We have compared the new list against any future competitive threat.","Third, although we had a great first quarter with 13.8% EPS growth, please do not expect or forecast higher earnings for the year than our forecast of 9% to 10% growth. Our $0.97 EPS growth target is already higher than almost all other CPG competitors. If things go better than we expect with regards to 2012, we will reinvest back into higher marketing spending in the second half to ensure that we exit 2012 with strong momentum, just like we exited 2011.","In conclusion 2012 is shaping up to be another very challenging year due to the weak consumer demand and high commodity prices. Well when things get ugly or stay ugly you should place your bets on the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in any environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage their portfolio to deliver strong earnings per share growth.","Now that ends our presentation. I'll open the call to questions that you may have which Matt and I'll do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator). And your first question comes from Bill [Tapel].","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Sarah] on for Bill. I just have a couple of questions about with the laundry pod. I'm wondering if you can give us some color on the pods business and how you saw initial sellthrough, how the growth progressed through the quarter and what you see growth trajectory looking like in the next couple of quarters? And then was your -- were you able to gain incremental shop space at your key retailers or was it more replacement shop space, just kind of give us some color around that?","Jim Craigie","It's really too early to really give a good forecast in the pods. We were out early, our distribution was almost entirely incremental. It's off to an okay \u2013 a good start, a very good start, but it's really too early. It's just the latest four week share that is coming in. It's really early for everybody. Marketing support in a big way it is just beginning to start and the same is true for our competitors.","So it's really too early to say how big the pods category will be and how everybody is doing. We are very happy with our start. Again the distribution was terrific, it was incremental and the initial takeaway by consumers is looking good, but again it's just too early I use that as a projection vehicle.","Unidentified Analyst","And then if I could, just one follow-up to that question. Given how early it is in the market, can you talk about your competence level with the capacity that you have and being able to support the business coming inhouse?","Jim Craigie","Yeah we feel very confident. You know like I said the product is coming inhouse by the end of Q2 and we will have plenty of capacity to meet demand to that product.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bill (inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","It is (inaudible) on for Bill. Another laundry question, can you guys just tell us how much total of the US laundry volume was up in the quarter because I mean if I look at the scanner data it looks like it probably came in a whole lot better than the data would suggest even considering the prebuys. So any help there will be appreciated?","Jim Craigie","Yeah Nick the laundry category exhibited a little bit more growth in the first quarter than some in the past, but it's not good. But nothing to shock folks with, we are more impressed by the fact that we had very strong share gains as we've had for the last couple of years. We continue to outpace the category as consumers trade down to our great value brands, but it was a good quarter, but I wouldn't say these trend so far, so let's see what happens over the rest of 2012.","Unidentified Analyst","Then if you don\u2019t mind, could you just comment a little further on the acquisition environment? I mean if there has been any meaningful changes since we last spoke?","Jim Craigie","I would just tell you that we don't discuss any specific details on M&A. I would tell you the environment is very active and we are very involved, but we have very specific acquisition criteria of looking only for leading brands and margin accretive brands and asset light brands. So far there's been nothing that was acquired by somebody that we regret and we're actively looking for acquisitions that fit that bill but that's about as far as I can go.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Tim (inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","Just a couple here. I guess to add on to that acquisition question, Jim do you think the environment will accelerate as we push towards the year end? Again we've seen this movie before and it didn't quite, the rules changed right near the end, but with the tax situation as it sits now and if they are for private companies, do you think there's a motivation there to get things done, number one?","Then you touched on it, but if you could give a little bit more color about your large competitor's commentary to rollback prices in certain categories and how that may impact you?","Jim Craigie","I've been wrong before about the acquisition environment. I think like you're insinuating that the lot of factors are going on with organic growth being tough for a lot of companies. Tax law changes in the future potentially that it would accelerate it. I would tell you that there is more activity out there as far as opportunities for deals, but it has materialized in deals quite honestly.","So I don't know. I would tell you I think sellers still are a little bit lofty on what they think they can get for their businesses and so it's kind of, you would think and I think you're right. I thought I was right in the past thing. I thought activity would pick up and it hasn't happened, but you never know, so stay tuned.","On our competitor rolling back prices I would say that only affects us in one category being powdered laundry detergents. We did take pricing in that category and we intend to maintain that price increase.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then one other maybe a little off-to-the-side question here. Again your powder brands are doing well, you guys continued the great track record of execution. Any thoughts at this point about further SKU rationalization in those pieces that generate only about 20% of sales that maybe a lesser piece of margin?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes absolutely Tim. It's an understatement to say you have no idea of the pressure inside this company to deliver our gross margin targets and that is leading to intense detail on every business, SKUs, small brands. You have no idea we even own out there that are small. We're looking under every rock in this company to find anything that delivers a low margin and either we can discontinue the SKU or even discontinue some tiny brands out of our 80 brands and like you don't know some of them, most people don't know some of them. So we're doing everything possible to drive our gross margin targets this year and into the future and that's resulting in intense scrutiny on every SKU in our portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason (inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","So I guess the first question I wanted to talk about is the personal care side and I know you have confidence in the second half, but obviously the business has been a little bit soft. So when we think about the guidance that you're providing, the gross margin obviously needs to see the negative mix turn a little bit more neutral with personal care coming back. But at the same point I guess I'm just trying to see what type of contingency plan do you have if personal care doesn't get better and household still continues to deliver?","I don't have any doubt about the EPS, but I'm wondering about the composition of your earnings growth next year or for this year, if the gross margin comes in lower because of personal care. So may be lead off of that as the first question?","Jim Craigie","So Jason we're feeling pretty good about personal care in the back half there. First of all we're lapping some pretty weak category trends in the back half of last year. And secondly, we have a whole slew of new products launching in the back half the year. So as I mentioned things like the TOOTH TUNES and that.","So we are feeling pretty confident and you know us, we always had contingency plans to make our numbers and it wouldn\u2019t be a worst thing in the world of our household business continue to -- it was raging growth and maybe the mix for the gross margin little bit, we make our EPS with, that\u2019s what we get paid to do. It\u2019s a lots on the levers and we will deliver that EPS and things change out there and we will adjust to it, but back to your further point is, we feel pretty damn good about the personal care business in the back half for the reasons I told you.","Unidentified Analyst","And then, just I guess kind of housekeeping related, what\u2019s your expectation for the specialty business, because I mean the organic sales I think it was a little bit weaker this quarter than we saw last year, so you are expecting negative organic sales, so hence the high end of the three to four is really going to be more consumer than maybe specialty helped that last year?","Jim Craigie","Yeah that\u2019s fair Jason. We got off to a very soft January and February, March and April ticked up, but it\u2019s a bit of hole for us to fill that on a full year basis for the specialty business. So yeah as far as on a full year basis the driver is going to be in the consumer business almost (inaudible). Don\u2019t forget that the specialty business has a lower gross margins, so to the extent that it\u2019s a little week that actually again houses make our corporate gross margin targets.","Unidentified Analyst","And then I guess just a last question, thinking about some of you brands that obviously if you have a strong following in the US like TROJAN or First Response, but not really getting that global expansion. I know, I am just wondering how do you guys talk internally with the Board just about how to get the real growth opportunities that are out there outside of really North America whether it\u2019s Canada, Mexico, the US but certainly it still seems to be a huge opportunity for many of your categories and your brands and I was just wondering how you guys think about that over the next few years?","Jim Craigie","Jason we do think about a lot. We don't really talk to you guys a lot, but I mean I can tell you First Response hit record shares in Canada and Australia this latest quarter. TROJAN hit a record share up in Canada and had a very strong quarter down in Mexico. So we are looking as best as possible to take our US brands outside of the US and grow, but we use good reasons. In some cases they have lag, in some cases they don't.","We've been driving share growth on ARM & HAMMER toothpaste over in the UK, we are still doing that again maybe our fault we don't talk about enough, but we are looking to as much as possible globalize some of our key brands, but we do it smartly. We got to look at the market overseas, where the competitors are and what kind of equity we believe we can have and where we've done it, we've taken first response into Australia and so it\u2019s a leading share brand and we've driven up in Canada and other countries. So maybe we should talk about it more in the future, but we are looking for that.","And then we look for strong brands in overseas market. You don't know the fact we have two or three local brands up in Canada that are market leaders like [Gravel] and that is up there I think, up (inaudible) from that. So maybe in fairness we should talk about more of that in the future so you\u2019ll understand what we are doing better.","Unidentified Analyst","And actually I am just going to throw one last one, you talked about the new channels with the vibration category, you picked my interest, so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that?","Jim Craigie","Well, those are channels that you largely visit to the adult store channels out there and that\u2019s actually the largest seller of adult products right now. So we have joined that channel, it\u2019s a little more difficult than other channels because there's a few change and then there's a lot of mom and pops and so it\u2019s a little slower distribution build, but right now it\u2019s the largest seller of vibration type products and we are making a full force effort through our distributors in that to get into that channel with that product.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Alice Longley [Buckingham Research]","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","I hope I didn't miss this; I think you said second quarter sales would be strong, did you specify where organic sales growth should be then? And then could you say something about this recall of Spinbrush and how much that might affect sales?","Matt Farrell","No, we did not call second quarter top-line. We just said we expected another strong quarter.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","What does that mean, stronger than three to four?","Jim Craigie","We've said on the year, we think we\u2019ll now finish it at the high end of our 3% to 4% range.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","And are you going to beat that in the second quarter and then be below that in the second half, that's my question?","Jim Craigie","Don't forget the pacing of our last year; organic growth last year from Q1 to Q4 went 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%. So this year we are starting up against weaker comps last year, but we end up again stronger comps in the back half, so we\u2019ve kind of guide everybody that think the opposite way this year, organic growth will start very strong and then as we lap big numbers in the back half it will get lower.","Saying the opposite is true for gross margin. Our stronger gross margins occurred in the front half of last year and the ones in the back half are weaker. so that's why we are telling you we think we will have gross margin outside in the back half of the year to get to our targeted 25 to 50 basis points. So that now were because the product mix we are seeing maybe toward the lower end of that target. So that's about as clear as we've been on those two factors.","Matt Farrell","Alice, the only line item call on the second quarter was we said that the gross margin in the second quarter will be comparable to the first quarter, so we have strong sales. But we don't, we are not calling the individual items on the P&L, just the EPS we said was around $0.54.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","The last comps I think last year it sounds really tough in the second half because it was 7% in the fourth quarter but that was partly a calendar issue and your calendar is pretty similar this year, right?","Matt Farrell","No, calendar issue.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Okay. So I guess my question, would your sales be up in the second half, will your organic sales be up in the second half?","Jim Craigie","Sure, yes.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","And then what about that recall?","Matt Farrell","The recall, as we said in the release that we\u2019ve recalled selected lots of Spinbrush, Rechargeable SONIC toothbrushes distributed between the day seven when they were released and we said that they are also it was a material item both to the second quarter and to the full year and the only context that I can give you is the annual sales of this particular Rechargeable SONIC toothbrush is less than $2 million.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","And then on the personal care category you highlighted that the decline was the categories, and you gained share was TROJAN and First Response; so how much of your category is declining in personal care?","Jim Craigie","Very weak, we\u2019ve had some categories like battery toothbrush is down about 3% toothache was down about 2% and then the condoms and diagnostics categories were up less than 1% that we consider to be weak. So, overall weakness, that\u2019s pretty common to all the industry as they are higher margin and more discretionary category, so those category traditionally grow in the 3% to 5% range. So we think that growth will come back when the economy comes back; in the mean time, like I said we are happy just pounding away at growing our shares in those categories.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Well, its sound from the numbers you just gave us, your category is sort of flat down one or something and you were down more than that so its sound if actually lost share?","Jim Craigie","That\u2019s not what I said. I told you TROJAN gained half a share point; First Response gained full share point in those category. So we\u2019re gaining share in some key categories that are just relatively weak or slightly down.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe [Altobello].","Unidentified Analyst","Just a couple of quick ones. I guess first on, in terms of the overall market growth you know Jim you've been pretty downbeat for a while and obviously been correct here. Have things gotten worse incrementally thus far in 2012 and secondly on that point have you seen any impact in your categories. Are they good or bad for you in terms of higher gas prices?","Jim Craigie","No, Joe it has kind of plateaued. It's kind of in a stall rate now out there in the categories which I honestly think we will continue for a little while ahead. You know again who knows what the election will do with the economy in that or what will happen around the world, but I call it kind of a plateau. I really haven\u2019t seen the gas thing, it's hard to translate through. I would say consumer package get a little more insulated from that, but other more discretionary things like going up to restaurants or buying items that you don\u2019t really need. You have to eat, you have to brush your teeth and you have to wash your cloth and things like that.","So I would think. I don\u2019t think it's being as much an impact as it has been on going out the outer restaurants and things like that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. so to make the link between the growth in household and high gas prices, that\u2019s not a driver?","Jim Craigie","I wouldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think this as much. I mean there is a lot you know there is a lot of things going on out there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bigger driver as in other businesses.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just secondly in terms of the marketing expense, is there a mix impact on marketing given the fact that your household businesses are growing so much faster?","Jim Craigie","No, not really Joe we pretty much planned flat dollar spending in the first quarter and then our volume exploded on is more in the household side. So again on a basis points or a percent of that revenue it doesn\u2019t look pretty, but it was pretty much in line with what we expected to spend and I told you we always plan to spend more money in the second through the fourth quarter because that's when our new product is launched and it is always more effective to launch and spend money against new product news and against the old product line.","So, that was just numbers games going on with marketing spending more than anything else. So we are very happy that we have lots of dry powder left to the back three quarters.","Operator","Thank you next question is from Connie (inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","I have a question. Earlier in the year you had some caution about the liquid laundry detergent category as unit dosing started to become part of it. So, I was wondering if you could describe what dynamics you think would be healthy for the category if unit dosing is successful?","Jim Craigie","The first quarter of that category in the food, drug and mass channels is only up a little less than 2%. We are kind of looking back at what happened in laundry additives a couple of years ago when a major competitor entered the category. And when that happened, some big product news, a lot of spending went on. And the category had very strong growth rates for the first four quarters and then it fell back and went negative for the last four or five quarters.","Again, you never know this is a huge category. It is like a $6 billion category versus that $1 billion category for laundry additive. So, I would think in this case with every competitor out there launching the pod, every competitor spending some kind of decent money to support those pods that I would expect to see some pretty strong category numbers maybe up in the mid high single digits on liquid laundry detergent for maybe three or four quarters and then the key thing will be repeat, how do customers react to it. It is going to be the highest price per wash for the laundry detergent out there which was pretty tough in a recessionary type economy, but the consumers will try it. There will be a lot of incentives to try it and the key thing will be when it goes back to its normal high prices and there's less incentives what the repeat purchases will be and again that will happen about a year after the products are launched.","Unidentified Analyst","So are the pods considered a part of liquid laundry because they are different forms, some of them are just powder and some are part liquid, part powder, how is that categories done, once investment spending is over, is it profit accretive in the category?","Jim Craigie","We are honestly tracking it as a separate category, but we look at it in combination with the liquid laundry detergent category. And the accretion, every company has got their own numbers as far as this product which is pretty expensive to make versus other stuff, but it is going to be sold at a higher price for wash load. So I can only speak for ourselves. At long term, this will be accretive and we will just have to see how much we sell and how well it does.","Operator","Your next question is from Caroline [Levy].","Unidentified Analyst","","A couple of questions. I don't know if you addressed this but I understand Maureen has left, who should we be calling with questions?","Matt Farrell","I am the lucky one. This is Matt Farrell.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, Matt good, so I am assuming it will take a while for you to replace. So you have not planned at this point?","Matt Farrell","Yeah big shoes to fill.","Unidentified Analyst","Secondly, my question is sort of around how much of the demand growth you've seen in laundry is coming from consumers being stretched. So that geographically, do you see a difference where your market shares are significantly higher and you're growing faster in the toughest economies in the US?","Jim Craigie","Caroline it is a very good question. Quite honestly, we haven't seen anything like that. I think you would see the economic pain is pretty spread across the country, but it is an interesting one, we really haven't looked into that kind of intense detail as to whether some higher markets maybe like a New York city compares to a very rural market, but, good question. I'll ask my troops to take a look at it, but I don't think there is anything that different, quite honestly across the markets right now.","Unidentified Analyst","I am just trying to understand if the economy ever improves and whether you can hold on to your share or not?","Jim Craigie","We will, we have lots of research data that show that consumers who have traded down and now have repeatedly tried our products over the last several years since this recession kind of kicked in 2008 are sticky with the brand even whether or not they get their jobs back or make more money in that. They have found that we truly produced a great laundry detergent and they can save you know a lot of money by buying us versus the higher priced brands.","Unidentified Analyst","Right and then if you were to suddenly see your volumes drop off a lot as a result of Procter discounting, would you take action? I mean are there certain levels that you are you will defend?","Jim Craigie","We always maintain careful price gaps versus all of our competitors and do take action when things like that happen. So yeah we do, we have a lot of scientific studies that tell us what price gaps we have to maintain and again across every brand against every competitor and we do I think we have quite a good reputation for knowing it. We take action very quickly when we see things that either close those gaps and we have to respond by lowering prices or some times increase the gaps so we take advantage of it by raising our prices.","Unidentified Analyst ","Right, I notice I think you said you are not going to buy any motions back this year. Is that right?","Matt Farrell","Not after April, we brought back in ","Unidentified Analyst ","Don\u2019t you have ample cash flow, I mean, because I think you know is this typical that you just do your certain amount or do you need further authorization?","Matt Farrell","Yeah, we actually hadn\u2019t brought back shares for over ten years until late in 2011 and this is a company that generates significant amount of free cash flow and we were building lot of excess cash. So obviously through the outlook, our dividend and buyback, and in February we raised our dividend again in 2011, we had doubled it, and in 2012 February we took it up again. So we are now at a 40% pay out and then the buyback of shares that we started in late 2011, we continued in March. So we said in February we would buy at least as much as we brought last year at a minimum and likely increase it and you are correct in that we generate lot of cash and in the first quarter we generated almost a $100 million of free cash flow and then at the quarter with 230 million of cash. We have an authorization of about $300 million. So we are going to start bumping up against that. So we would need another authorization of a similar size to continue what we have been doing for the last two months.","Unidentified Analyst ","It is just the way you say that sounded pretty (inaudible) that you are not going to do more. Is that open for discussion?","Matt Farrell","Not for this year.","Unidentified Analyst ","This year.","Matt Farrell","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay. And then do you think marketing expense in the second quarter will be up a little bit, actual dollars?","Matt Farrell","Yeah, we expect marketing to increase in the second quarter from. You\u2019re talking about from the first quarter or year-over-year?","Unidentified Analyst ","Year-over-year.","Matt Farrell","Year-over-year it will be up.","Unidentified Analyst ","But the real increase, the more dramatic increase will be in the back half. Is that what you are expecting?","Matt Farrell","Well, we are expecting it to increase the rest of the year actually because on a full year basis, we are expecting 13% on starting at that 10.8% and reason why we, the first quarter is typically low-ish because we don\u2019t have full distribution on our new products. So it is common for us to have higher marketing spending in Q2, Q3 and Q4 and then Q1.","Unidentified Analyst ","Right. And if gross margin doesn\u2019t do everything you hope it will, would you adapt to marketing expense that you will make your targeted EPS growth?","Matt Farrell","Marketing isn\u2019t the only area we look at and we look across the board and make the leverage. So we are not going our goal really in the year is to increase and get that 15% and if there is upside, which I think there is more chance of now. Than down side we would spend that more on marketing to exit the year. It will add to a great momentum ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from [Erin Lash].","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the acquisition environment and specifically what areas you would be looking to either build out your portfolio or build out your geographic reach on growth and acquisition?","Jim Craigie","We are pretty agnostic on that. We have consistently said over time, we look for our criteria again. Number one and number two share brands, margin accretive brands, growth accretive brands that we think we can grow steadily, and asset like brands. And I think our history has shown that we\u2019ll look at almost any category and any geography doing that. Keep in mind, I mean, today we make products and almost every type of product, liquids, powders, rolls on sticks, rubbers, sprays and everything. So that holds the door to look at a lot of other categories because we can bring those products into our plans and save a lot of money from the current orders. No, we\u2019re pretty agnostic and we did, our most recent acquisition was the BATISTE hair spray brand over the UK. We\u2019ve never been in hair spray. It\u2019s UK, which is one of our smaller markets but we got into that business. We happen to make aerosols in our UK plant. So we brought, we are bringing that product in house to help us save money, drive our gross margins north and just one of the fastest growing hair spray brands in the UK market. And it\u2019s also a fantastic start. So that just shows you nobody would ever have thought we would have gone in the hair spray business. We've found a great opportunity, higher margin; high growth, asset life, great gross margins and we bought that business.","Unidentified Analyst","And just follow-up and I apologize if I missed this but what is your expectation, have you provided an expectation for commodity costs for the year?","Matt Farrell","We haven't, other than to save it, we don't expect them to, we don't expect that to be down year-over-year, commodity costs are higher for us year-over-year. We did say that we are hedged. So we are not as concerned about movements in the second half for the remainder of the year actually.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from [Thomas Wilkin].","Unidentified Analyst","Going back to the 40% payout ratio for dividends, that's the highest payout ratio in the last 11 years and percentage wise a big increase in the dividend. Does this reflect a change in philosophy at the board level; we are seeing this at other companies. I wonder whether you would comment whether there's more emphasis now on dividends versus buybacks.","Matt Farrell","Yeah, historically the company for many years had a payout ratio of somewhere between 10% and 15% and as the company has become a lot, lot bigger over time with more and more power brands and generated significantly more free cash flow on an annual basis. The company has realized that we generate a lot of excess cash. So we slowly have being bringing it up. So we went from 15% to 30% payout a year ago and then we took it up to 40% payout this February. The philosophy frankly is that the company's strategy were (inaudible) company. So we always want to have plenty of capacity to acquire and add to our power brands and over the period of time we have now, we were BBB rated. That was far, different story several years ago. So the company's access to the capital markets is significantly greater than it was historically. So therefore we have the excess cash, the excess of the capital markets convinces us. So we don't need to hang on to that cash and that we can take the dividend up and pay money back to our shareholders, and then take some shares out and at least cover share creep on annual basis, and then some if we have additional cash.","Unidentified Analyst ","But do you think the board has preference now for dividends versus buybacks.","Matt Farrell","No, no. Once you declare a dividend its apparent, right? So we are going to be, we have been paying dividends for, I don't know, how many; 100 years? So, we continue to pay, we are going to continue to pay dividend.","Unidentified Analyst","Let me word my question in other way. Percentage wise, using your free cash flow for dividends or buybacks, the allocation for dividends is increasing now. Right?","Matt Farrell","As far as the dividends go, we can only comment on what we've declared as dividends today and we cannot project in future what our, if there are going to be future increases. That's something that the board and management evaluates on an annual basis; as far as we can go on that topic.","Operator","Your next question is from Marc Riddick [Williams Capital].","Marc Riddick - Williams Capital","I was wondering about the comment you mentioned on the trading down process for your brands and sort of consistent with that it seem as though retailers are not \u2013 and sort of pulled back from embracing or at least aggressively pursuing private label in store brand compared to maybe where they were a couple of years to go.","And if that\u2019s the case and you consider that my view it doesn\u2019t have to be yours, but if that\u2019s the case I was wondering then provide you a different view or impact how you are looking at marketing for the remainder of the year or maybe sort of addressing maybe target areas that you might look at?","Jim Craigie","Well Marc, it\u2019s a good insight. In our 13 categories, private label only have a meaningful presence, so what I mean by that more than say 10 share points in about three of those categories. And the history of private label has been that only in categories we it has a meaningful presence does it really cause some harm during economic tough times. So first of all I said, we face private label only in a very few of our categories.","And retail, always have a tough time on growing; you would see overall private labels been creeping due to the economic, but again its very small piece of majority of categories. Now most of the people buying our products Marc have just as you\u2019ve seen the fact that you know they\u2019ve tried them, they were facing some tighter to pocket books, they have always heard about our great brands and they tried them and they found out how terrific they are.","The growth rates we\u2019re seeing, I think (inaudible) and it\u2019s just fantastic and proving that people didn\u2019t just try it once and run back to other brand, they tried it, realized how good it was, they repeated it and called that sheer requirements; how many of your annual purchases you make from a particular brand and we are seeing our share requirements to grow steadily.","Brands like ARM & HAMMER, people find out how great they are, people forget too we have several forms of that brand, we have ARM & HAMMER with OXICLEAN. We have ARM & HAMMER laundry detergents for sensitive skin so we have all the variety that the premium brands have, but we offer a bit more of a value prices. So people who need them for whatever purpose again more powerful cleaners with like OXICLEAN and or sensitive skin we have those varieties and the people can say quite a bit of money, I mean on a 150 ounce jug of laundry detergent you will save $9 by buying ARM & HAMMER versus the premium brand and that's quite a bit of money in today's pocket book.","Marc Riddick - Williams Capital","And I agree with those sentiments, but from the standpoint of, would you say that do you still think you have to communicate that to the retailers, because from the standpoint of understanding the consumer behavior, I get that there's trade down and then the trade across or whatever it maybe, the consumers get it, they are happy with it, and their behavior becomes sticky, do you find yourself continuing to how to educate the retailers that this is the case and then from that standpoint future shelf space gains maybe possible?","Jim Craigie","Well, tough question; I mean retailers are very under support for private label. Some are very focused on growing their private label and had very minimal private label. For those who have minimal private label they are all about big brands. They love our brands and push them. For those that have private label businesses, we do what we constantly do to educate them about the power of having our brands as part of their portfolio.","And again the growth rate, they just can't deny how fast our brands are growing and as they are behind our brands like ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, they are losing out the marketplace right now and that led to a lot of distribution gains for us and a lot of share growth over the past several years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Leigh Ferst [Wellington Shields]","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields","I have a question about how you are discussing your gross margin progression and I realized you probably analyze this from a lot of different point of view. But you are talking about on a sequential quarterly basis more than your year-over-year; and I was wondering if you could tell us the reason why you\u2019re set up to do with the commodity environment or something else?","Jim Craigie","Now the way to think about it is this. In the first half of the year, we have the mix issue obviously hurting us and when we\u2019re saying that that\u2019s going to get a little bit better in the second half and one of the reasons for that what I said was that we have a little more balance in personal care in the second half from compared to household versus the first half.","I remember we have some new products something like TOOTH TUNES in the second half that are going to help us. We also are slotting that\u2019s very front end loaded this is year. So slotting is another drag on gross margin and there is an absence of that in the second half.","The third thing which would be price, so we have taken price selectively on some brands in the first quarter. And those would for example, (inaudible) and natural, just the natural layer and also baking soda. But that\u2019s really being offset by the slotting. So as you move to the year and we get to the second half we get the benefit of that, so that\u2019s a plus in the second half.","The other thing is that we have to develop our plant, that with startup cost in the first half, we don\u2019t have those startup cost in the second half. We are manufacturing the unit those, or pods outsider third party in the first half. We are not making it in our house in the second half.","And then we have a number of programs with two of our personal care plants, one in Folkestone, UK and then in the Lakewood, New Jersey where we expect to get the benefits of the completion of certain projects starting in the third quarter.","So there are a number of things that benefit the second half that are not in the first half. So that's the way to think about why on a year-over-year basis, we think we are going to be showing positive gains in the second half versus the first half.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. Please go ahead with your closing remarks.","Jim Craigie","Okay, everybody. Again, this is Jim Craigie; I want to thank you all for taking the time to listen to our first quarter results. Again, we are very thrilled with those results. We've given you our outlook on the year which I think is consistent with what you expect from us overtime. So with that, if you have any questions, follow-up, call in Matt and I wish you all a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Q1 2012 earnings call.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, especially when we have great results to report. I'll start off the call by providing you with my perspective on our third quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our current Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and soon to replace me as Chief Executive Officer.","Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to discuss our earnings guidance for the year, and then we'll open the call to field questions from you. You should also know that Rick Dierker is here with us today, who replace Matt as CFO in 2016.","Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the third quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued soft U.S. consumer demand and weakening foreign currency, the Church & Dwight team built upon our momentum in the first half of this year and continue to leverage our innovation-driven strategy to deliver strong business results in the third quarter 2015.","This is exemplified by the fact that our organic revenue growth of 3.2% in Q3 was the sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth above 3%, even though we are now lapping high organic growth levels of 5% achieved in the back half of 2014.","As I have stated on previous earnings calls, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in any economic and competitive environment. Innovation has been a key driver of our past success, as shown by the fact that over 25% of our domestic sales so far this year came from new product launched in the past five years. In 2015, we launched new products in every one of our major category. Some of these new products, like our new premium price cat litter called ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL, have become a huge hit with our consumers as reflected in both the brand's share results and its impact on category growth.","We first launched the new ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter products in 2014, which drove a 23.5% increase in our consumption and grew our share by 290 basis points to a record share of 22.9%. In 2015, we built upon this success by launching a new lightweight version of the CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. This product is also off to a great start. Our total ARM & HAMMER cat litter consumption in the first nine-months of 2015 was up 15% and our share grew to a new record of 24.0%.","This share growth in 2014 and 2015 has enabled our cat litter brand to grow from number three brand in the category to a strong and growing number two brand. And this growth help drive the cat litter category up 8.6% in the first nine months of last year on top of the 8% growth in 2014. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key anecdote to driving improved value creations for our consumers, customers and shareholders.","Our goal is to continue launch innovative new products to drive share gains and category growth in all the categories in which we compete.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt to give you specific details on our third quarter results.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Our third quarter reported EPS was $0.90 per share compared with $0.85 in 2014, that's up 5.9%. The $0.90 was better than our $0.87 to $0.88 outlook for the quarter. And netted in our $0.90 is 4.7% drag from FX year-over-year. Reported revenues were up 2.4% to $862 million. Organic sales were 3.2%, exceeding our Q3 outlook of 2%. The organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic (04:17 \u2013 04:23) is due to volume with 1% positive product mix and pricing.","Now, let's review the segments. The consumer domestic business' organic sales increased by 2.8%, driven by the continuous success of our ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal cat litter franchise, including the new lightweight variant. Also, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and higher sales of VITAFUSION gummy vitamins and BATISTE (04:50 \u2013 04:52)","Out of the 2.8% organic sales growth in the domestic business, volume growth contributed approximately 1.6% plus to 1.2% effect of positive price. We continue to expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2.5% for the consumer domestic business.","Now, let's talk about international. International organic growth was up 7.9%. Volume increased approximately 6.9%, and we had favorable product mix and pricing of 1%. We had strong growth across Australia, Canada, Mexico and Europe, and in particular, our French team had a spectacular quarter with success with BATISTE. We now expect the full-year organic growth to be approximately 7% for the consumer international business.","Now, we'll talk about specialty products. For our specialty products division, organic sales was down 2.2% with volume declining 1.4% and unfavorable product mix and pricing of 80 basis points, driven by a difficult comp of up 22% a year ago. We said in May that SPD would come back down to Earth, and it has. Currently, the U.S. dairy industry is still healthy, although milk prices have declined from an average of approximately $23 in Q3 2014 to approximately $16 in Q3 2015. The good news is that corn and soybean are also down, and the dairy industry continues to be profitable.","Our comps are very difficult in the second half of this year. Remember, last year Q3 and Q4 were both 20% up quarter. We now expect the full year to be approximately flat for the Specialty Products Division.","For the total company, we continue to expect organic sales to be approximately 3% for the year.","Now, gross margin. Our reported third quarter gross margin was 44.8%, a 110 basis points increase from a year ago. The Q3 gross margin benefited from four factors: lower trade spending as we had a more normalized pricing environment in the laundry category; productivity programs; lower commodities; and a higher margin from our acquired businesses. These factors were partially offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix, and incremental costs associated with our new vitamin capacity at our York plant.","For the full year, in August, we called 25 to 35 basis points of gross margin expansion. We now expect a range of 35 to 45 basis points on a full-year basis.","Now, marketing. Marketing spend for the third quarter was $92.8 million or 10.8% of revenues, which is 70 basis points lower than the prior-year spend rate, largely driven by shifting some marketing funds through trade and coupons to continue supporting consumer trial generating activities for the OXICLEAN megabrand.","For Q4, our expectation is for marketing to be flat year-over-year. Our full-year expectation is approximately 12.3% of sales or down 30 basis points, primarily due to the previously mentioned OXICLEAN megabrand investment shift.","Now, SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.9%. That's an 80-basis point increase from the prior-year third quarter. This was primarily due to incremental amortization from acquisitions, higher incentive compensation and research and development spending. Our full-year expectation is for SG&A to be flat as a percentage of sales.","Other income and expense was $4.9 million, which is largely interest expense of $7 million. With respect to operating profit, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 22.1%, which was 100 basis points higher than the prior-year third quarter.","Next is income taxes. While quarters may be uneven, our effective rate for the quarter is 35.2% and that's higher than our full-year expectation of 34.5%. The Q3 rate is higher year-over-year, primarily due to the year-ago benefit from an IRS settlement.","Cash flow is next. We generated $408.8 million of net cash for the first nine months of 2015 and that's in line with the prior period. We have invested $44.7 million year-to-date in CapEx and continue to expect to spend approximately $70 million for full-year 2015. Cash from operations is expected to exceed $585 million and free cash flow to exceed $515 million.","In conclusion, the third quarter highlights are 3.2% organic sales growth, 5.9% EPS growth, which equates to 10.6% currency neutral EPS growth.","Now I'm going to talk about the fourth quarter. Remember, our previous outlook was for the second half top line to grow 2%, we still believe that. With Q3 growth of 3%, we expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 1%.","For context, if we want to look at this on a two-year stacked basis; Q1 would be 5%; Q2, 8%; Q3, 8%; and then the coming Q4, 6%, as last year we had a 5% organic growth quarter. And (10:23 \u2013 10:25) we expect gross margin to expand. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.79 per share (10:33 \u2013 10:36) and remember we had 20% EPS growth a year ago in the quarter.","Now, I'm going to wrap and talk about the full year to summarize our thinking. We continue to expect 3% organic sales growth and full-year gross margin expansion of 35 to 45 basis points. As we work our way down the P&L, we now expect marketing at 12.3% of sales and operating margin expansion of 65 to 75 basis points. As far as other income and expense, excluding the impairment from earlier in the year, other income and expense is higher by $6 million or approximately $23 million expense in 2015.","The full-year adjusted EPS range is now 7% to 8%, that's inclusive of a 4% drag from currency. And I want to remind us that we started the year with a 7% to 9% EPS outlook and a 2.5% currency drag. The currency drag has been growing all year long. In May, it grew to 3%. In August, when we spoke to you, it was 3.5%. And now, it's 4%. So, that's a total of $0.06 of higher EPS drag than when we started the year. So we've raised our currency neutral midpoint to 11.5% in August and we're affirming that today.","Back to you, Jim.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt. Before I open the floor to questions, I'd like to provide a few additional highlights on our third quarter business results in our key categories and business units. As you know, we continue to sharpen our focus on our four megabrands: ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, Trojan and our vitamin business, which each cover multiple categories.","These four brands represent over 60% of our company's sales and profits and have achieved the most growth over the past five years through delivering a bigger bang for every dollar of marketing investment than smaller one-category brands. In 2015, we plan to spend over 80% of our media investment on the four megabrands. This investment continues to pay off as we achieved share growth on two of these four megabrands through the first nine months of 2015 despite aggressive competition.","The ARM & HAMMER megabrand had an excellent quarter with total consumption up 5%, driven by its laundry detergent and cat litter products. I previously mentioned the excellent cat litter share results for the first nine-months of 2015. The specific third quarter results continued a strong momentum of this business as consumption grew 15% and our share increased 150 basis points to a record 24.0% share behind the new Clump & Seal product line.","ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent also had a solid quarter of growth, driven by its liquid laundry detergent which achieved its highest ever quarterly share and its 23rd consecutive quarter of year-on-year share growth. It's important to mention that the total laundry detergent category grew 2.6% versus a year ago in the third quarter, the second consecutive quarter growth after three years of category decline.","This category growth reflects two factors: first, a return to more normalized pricing environment and second, that the category has now absorbed most of the unfavorable impact of the launch of the unit just formed by our competitor. Hopefully, the laundry category will continue to grow in future quarters as it historically did driven by category-building innovation and a normalized pricing environment.","We now can talk about other products and all the categories covered by the ARM & HAMMER megabrand. The ARM & HAMMER carpet deodorizers achieved its highest ever quarterly share of 53.9%, up 420 basis points versus year ago. All in all, a great quarter for the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, which is our largest megabrand with over $1 billion in annual sales.","Next, the OXICLEAN megabrand, who share is up 20 basis points in the first nine months of the year. This megabrand's third quarter dollar share was down slightly. However, the brand's two biggest forms, OXICLEAN powder and OXICLEAN liquid laundry detergent achieved share gains. OXICLEAN's share of the $1 billion stain fighters category, its original category, increased 230 basis points to 46.0% which is greater than the combined share of the next five brands in the category. OXICLEAN liquid laundry detergent, which was first launched in the first quarter of 2014, grew its sales over 20% versus year ago and achieved its highest ever quarterly share.","Our third megabrand, the Trojan brand, had a solid quarter as all three segments of this megabrand grew. The Trojan condom business achieved its second highest quarterly share in the past five years at 76.4%. In the total condom category, the top 12 SKUs all belong to the Trojan brand, and 25 of the top 30 SKUs are also Trojan SKUs.","Other forms in the Trojan megabrand also had a solid quarter. The Trojan Vibrations line of products grew its share by 310 basis points to 58.0%. Our Vibrations line now has the top 3 SKUs in the category. And finally, the Trojan lubricant line first launched in February 2013 grew its share by 30 basis points to 7.7%, making it the number three selling brand at lubricants category.","While the condom category is relatively flat, our Vibrations and Lubricant categories are growing at high-single digits, far above the average consumer products business category growth rate.","Last but not least is our newest megabrand, the gummy vitamin business, which we bought in October 2012. This business consist of two brands; L'il Critters for kids gummy vitamins and VITAFUSION for adult gummy vitamins. Last quarter, I reported that despite strong demand for our gummy vitamin business, sales actually declined in the second quarter, primarily due to self-inflicted supply constraints, involving the slower than expected startup of a new production line in our York, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. I'm pleased to report that our gummy sales grew over 7% in the third quarter as production rates and customer service levels have significantly improved.","In addition to our four megabrands, we had a great third quarter of some of our higher margin power brands. Our First Response pregnancy kit brand achieved a record quarterly dollar share of 32.9%, up 250 basis points.","Church & Dwight has been the number one manufacturer of branded pregnancy kits for 43 consecutive quarters. And our NAIR depilatory brand achieved a record quarterly share of 60.9%, up 450 basis points. NAIR has been the number one depilatory brand for 44 consecutive quarters with 7 of top 10 SKUs in the category.","I'd also like to highlight some great news on our dry shampoo brand called BATISTE. We purchased this brand in the second quarter of 2011, which at that time, was the number one dry shampoo in the UK. We have now expanded the brand to over 80 countries, and next year, it'll become our next power brand with projected sales over $100 million.","In the U.S., BATISTE is the fastest growing dry shampoo brand with sales up over 100% this year which propelled it from the number seven rank dry shampoo, to the number two rank in the third quarter. While dry shampoo represents only 3% of the total shampoo category in the U.S. The dry shampoo sub-category is up 34% year-to-date, while the bigger wet shampoo sub-category is up only 2%. Going forward, we plan to leverage the double-digit growth of the dry shampoo sub-category through new product innovations and increased marketing support. To drive the dry shampoo sub-category to at least where it is in the UK at 9% of the total shampoo category three times the current market share in the U.S.","This is another great examples of Church & Dwight's successful acquisition strategy in which we can make even a relatively small acquisition with unique consumer benefits and quickly turn it into a strong contributor to the profitable growth of our company.","Overall, a very solid quarter for our four megabrands and several of our power brands. I'll finish off, our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the year. As I stated in the press release, we are maintaining our 2015 guidance on organic sales growth and improving our guidance on gross margin. We are not changing the midpoint of our currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth for 2015 of 11.5%. You might question why we're not raising our targets in view of the strong results in the first nine months of 2015.","We simply do not feel comfortable of doing at this time for several reasons. First, we had an incredibly strong organic sales growth of over 5% in the fourth quarter of 2014, so we have to comp over those results. And second, if we do have additional earnings upside we will invest it in incremental marketing to enable us to support stronger share growth in our four megabrands behind our new product innovations as we exit 2015.","In summary, we feel confident in delivering our annual targets which are in the top quartile of EPS projections that in our industry consistent with our historical performance. The achievement of our targets will be driven by a resilient portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products across every one of our major categories, aggressive productivity programs and tight management overhead costs.","I also want to assure you that we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions and a significant financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions because we are very selective of the types of businesses we acquire and very aggressive how we integrate them into our existing business. That ends our presentation.","I'd now like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey. I'd like to start, so you guys put up a slide, I guess, in late September at an investor conference and took the top line algorithm down to 3% from 3% to 4%, understanding that you hadn't put that slide up in Ohio. But can you guys touch a little bit on industry growth, how your view \u2013 I guess three different components, really. Talk about industry growth, ability to gain market share, and then maybe a little bit of the tougher M&A environment with respect to multiples and given the long discipline that the company has had, the inability to close some of these deals and get accretive organic deals done?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Kevin, it's Jim. I'd answer as follows: Industry growth as far as \u2013 I can talk in category growth \u2013 is actually ticking up a little bit with probably one of the best quarters in a long time in the sense of how many categories of the 14 we compete in grow. It's not huge, but it's a nice little incremental growth. So I feel somewhat positive despite all those somewhat negative signs you read about the economy these days. So I would say at this point in time, I would not worry about the industry growth and maybe it's getting a little better.","Share growth, hey, we always feel good about that. I mean, we've got great new product pipelines this year. Next year, I feel extremely good about our new product pipeline. Marketing spending, we've shaved it a little so far this year, but nothing near what everybody else has shaved, when your revenue (21:39) like Colgate has cut 23% of their marketing. Our share of voice is still very high, and we feel very confident we'll continue to grow share out there. And M&A environment is \u2013 if you read a lot of stories, I would just tell you, we're very active.","I'm not worried about competing on price for the right acquisition out there. But always \u2013 the story is finding the right acquisition that we believe has all the factors that we want to see in acquisitions as far as having strong growth potential, a higher margin than our corporate margin, the asset-light net. So, we are continuing to scour the minefield for those kind of acquisitions, and I don't worry about price.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. All right. That's helpful and just one for me. Maybe touch a little bit on the decision, so A&M comes down modestly, not a big deal but I guess the decision has been made to reallocate some of that to trade promotion. Can you talk a little bit about that decision?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Kevin, I would just say that A&P spending, if you adjusted it for FX in Q3, we spent equal to a year ago. And again, that's a hell of a lot better than a lot of our competitors who cut their A&Ps significantly to cover problems like foreign exchange. And in Q4, the marketing spending will be the highest level of smart marketing spending for the year. So, I feel very confident that it will propel us to some good strong share gains in the fourth quarter and next year with strong momentum.","So, we have kept marketing up much better than I believe many of our competitors, have been able to keep our share of voice. And it should lead to very strong share results going forward.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Hi, Jason.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. I guess, I was just wondering if you can give us maybe a little bit of a sneak peek into next year. I'm sure you're going through all the budgeting now and want to get to the fourth quarter. But can you talk maybe, I guess, two things in particular, about the core business, if there's anything out there that you think might get a little bit better, worse, versus what you've seen this year. And then, maybe tie into kind of currency, how that's positioned into next year? Just \u2013 I know this year you're saying kind of a 4% drag to the bottom line, but how we should be thinking about that for next year?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. Hey, Jason. This is Matt. So, as you know, our model, as Kevin pointed out, is for revenue growth of 3% and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion annually, and we're going to keep with our past practice of giving our outlook in February and then a line item outlook at that time, too.","But as you know, there's always pluses and minuses so, take one of your points, currency. So, the EPS drag this year was 4%, but that was actually muted by FX hedges that we got out in front of. So, actually the FX hurt this past year would have been 6% if not for actions that we took before the year started. A year ago, things started getting pretty volatile with currencies.","On the plus side, the vitamin business is coming around, and we expect the vitamin production difficulties not to repeat in 2016, so that's a plus. I'm sure that's on some people's minds as well. But if you wanted to estimate what the \u2013 what would the FX drag be for us next year, we'd say probably 2% to 3%.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. No, that's good. Yeah, I do know you wait until February, but I just figured this was on the topic of mine. The other question, and maybe we could just talk a little bit about laundry and maybe specifically just about OXICLEAN at the high end, and certainly we've seen a little bit more. I mean, I know you're saying the environment is more rational, and I do agree with that. The high end, kind of the bigger player out there, I think, is doing a little bit more responding to the new guy in town. So, I was just wondering how that affects OXICLEAN. Is that where some of that promo spending might be going on that brand? And then how does that really affect to the consumer? I know the high end and the low end are different, but usually when there's gaps in terms of the price to the consumer, do customers kind of see that or are they kind of just mutually exclusive?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. Hey, Jason. This is Matt. You probably \u2013 if you got the Nielsen data, you know that the OXI liquid laundry detergent was up 8% in consumption in the third quarter. And we had lots of successful promotion in Q3. In fact, it created some out-of-stock situations with some of our retailers. And consequently, if you're looking at the Nielsen's, you'd see lower ACV, that's purely because of out of stock.","So we made a decision that we wanted to get behind OXICLEAN. When you enter a new category, you're always going to find a lot of competition. And as you know, the OXICLEAN has been growing its share throughout the year, but it's tough sledding. So with respect to the pricing, it's a 20% discount to Tide -Tide which is top end of the brand of the tier. So, naturally, we have somewhat of an advantage there. When you mention Henkel coming into the category, naturally Persil is \u2013 started out at Walmart and Amazon earlier in the year, and now they're going to be rolling out to other retailers. So this is a good time for us to get behind the brand.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate the color.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, how big is BATISTE and how big can it be? Because I've talked to some industry folks and it seems like it's got like software margins on it.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What kind of margins?","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Software.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're not going to comment on the margins for BATISTE. When we bought that business in 2011, it had $25 million in trailing net sales, and as Jim said, we think that this thing can be $100 million, and that would be not just \u2013 it's growing significantly outside the U.S. right now. It's very small in the U.S., but we're the number two brand, and we started a year out as the number five brand. So we've been growing like a rocket.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Bill, I would just say the gross margin is well above the company average, and we're gaining distribution left and right. So this is a super hot brand we have, and it's very hot in those consumers out there, and we feel very positive about the growth of this brand. It's just a little monster for us, I would call it.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Awesome. And then I started to belabor the laundry point, but like it seems there's a huge disconnect now between people's share of shelf and their share of market, so like how long does it take to make those adjustments if some of the stuff doesn't kind of work as planned? And then where does XTRA kind of fit in? Because everything else is going great, but it seems like it's been a couple of years now where XTRA is just kind of find out where it fits in, and it seems like they've been linked to one of the biggest share donors in the category.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. Bill, your comment on share of market and share of shelf is very interesting. For example, Persil just lost this year to Walmart. They initially got 19 SKUs. Our analysis would show only 2 or 3 of those SKUs would survive long tier, the rest of them all in the bottom quartile of SKU performance. So as they roll out, they're going to have to justify hard why they have any more than 2 or 3 SKUs as they go out based on their performance at Walmart.","XTRA's got a little bit of a hard year. We have plans in place to restore growth on that brand. We still believe it's a very strong part of our franchise. It still hangs in around a five share, which is a very meaningful player in the category, and we've got some new product performances, new products from non-XTRA I think will revitalize growth of XTRA.","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Hey, Bill. It's Rick, Bill. The only thing I'd add on XTRA is, yeah, share is down, but sales and profits are up. So, we're not repeating some of those cheap trade deals we had a year ago.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just one last quick one. Do you know when will the commodity favorability peak for you guys? I'm trying to figure out like when does all of this stuff kind of like flow to the P&L?","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Yeah. It's been flowing through this year. One of the reasons why we're taking gross margin up for the full year from 25% to 35% to 35% to 45% is because of the commodity favorability.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you.","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","There aren't going to be four more quarters to that afterwards.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. But are they with the top of the bell curve or are we still on the upward slope?","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","No. I think we're peaking.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","We're not going to be seeing a whole lot of year-over-year favorability next year.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Good morning.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. First on the Q4 organic growth guidance. Obviously, Q3 came in better than we expected, but you're only looking for 1% in Q4 and I get that the comp gets a bit tougher, but the deceleration in Q4 versus Q3 is a bit more than that. So, was there \u2013 is there anything that pulled forward from the fourth quarter or is that potentially just some conservatism? And then \u2013 I'm sorry I jumped on late, but on SG&A, can you just give a little bit of color on what drove that increase there? Thanks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Olivia, on the Q4 organic, keep in mind, as you said and we noted the \u2013 we're comping a huge number a year ago of 5% and a fair part of that number was driven by some increased promotional spending in the laundry business. So, the whole category has kind of pulled back on that. Hey, look, if we wanted to beat 1%, we could easily put more money into the trade line and drive a bigger thing, but we don't want to upset what seems to be a much more normalized pricing environment in laundry category right now.","So, we're very happy to deliver the 1% on top of the 5%, which as Matt said, if you stack it on the two-year basis is a very small number. Don't view that all to deceleration of our business. It is not, we've got a great new product pipeline for next year and we're going to be coming out with kind of, we're not calling the number now, but quite a historic type of organic growth rate as we have in the past, we feel very confident about that. On SG&A, I'll turn it to Matt.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. On SG&A, we started the year saying we were going to get 15 basis points of leverage on that line item as percentage of sales. And now, we're saying flat, two reasons for that, and one is R&D spend and the other is just our incentive comp. So it's pretty simple.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Hey, Bill.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Jim, I know you love these calls so much. Is this the last time we're going to hear from you for retirement?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You kind of spoiled my closing there. But this is my 45th and last quarter of the earnings call. And as you all know, Matt will be replacing me as the head of the company, but I'll stay on as the chairman. I will just tell everybody it's an honor and a privilege to be the CEO of this great company, and I've enjoyed most of the time communicating with you over the past 11 years. I'd also tell you that I strongly recommended Matt as my successor and I have total faith in his ability to continue the great results.","And I put my money where my mouth is because the large portion of my personal wealth is tied up with Church & Dwight stock and I intend to keep it that way. So I would just say thank you to everybody. I'll be around, you may see me hanging out at some Analyst Conference once in a while as they give on free food. And otherwise, I've got a great team here between Matt and Rick taking over the company. And we also appointed a new chief marketing officer last week. So we got a great team for the future.","William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","That's great. I enjoyed working with your and didn't mean to preempt your closing. But it actually ties into my next question of in terms of P&G, I mean, Jim, you've seen over the years the biggest competitive changes have been \u2013 have occurred when there's been a new CEO at P&G. What's your initial take or what are your \u2013 what's kind of the expectations with the CEO change of how the competitive landscape might play out over in laundry over the next six months?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's an interesting question. But I mean, I don't think it will change that much. In fact, it's like we've referenced a few times already today, it seems like the laundry category is getting back to more of a normalized pricing environment, which we really think it's the right way to go and drive the categories through innovation. So, that's the way we're going to play the game. We got great new innovations next year.","I think the CEOs who are all taking over at Procter has taken over, and Matt and gang all have great experience in the laundry category, are smart enough not to do stupid things and start trade wars that have nobody benefits from. So, I think you got a bunch of very smart characters who understand the business and understand that innovation is a key to it.","And now we've had two straight quarters of growth in the laundry category, which are very positive. So I certainly hope everybody understands that, and I think certainly we do at Church & Dwight here. Matt and Rick understand that well, and I think it bodes for good things going forward in the laundry category in my opinion.","William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Great. And then, Matt, just on the vitamins, so the thought that vitamins are kind of back on growth trend and there are less kind of category issues, and then can you maybe quantify what the total expense of kind of the start-up costs were to this year which we'll be comping through next year?","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","I can help you with some of that, Bill. I don't know about the last one. To give everybody some context, we had operating difficulties with the new plant and the contractors in Q2. Our sales were down for vitamins. We had some retailers on allocation. Had some out of stocks and pulled some promotions. So we're pretty much in the penalty box.","And today, I'm happy to report that our fill rates for the last six weeks are over 95%. Production rates are up, our product quality has improved, and importantly, we have growing interest on the part of the retailers (35:43) new products looking ahead. So it's \u2013 things have turned around for us. As far as quantifying, Bill, we wouldn't take a swing at that.","William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","All right, I got to ask. All right. Well, thanks so much. And, Jim, congratulations. I enjoyed working with you.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks.","Unknown Speaker","(36:09).","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","In terms of M&A, you guys have obviously been pretty active over the last few years. But recently, something that was (36:17) of the smaller variety or should have \u2013 there's a way for you our megabrand strategy to some extent. So as you think about M&A going forward, is it still your preference to do bigger acquisitions or you're more comfortable with the smaller, sort of tuck-in variety?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Joe, I would tell you we're ambivalent toward it because it always just depends on the right deal. What we mentioned today, BATISTE was a relatively small acquisition and now it's quadrupling in size. It's growing like crazy. So we don't mind that. And because we're still a relatively small player in this category, a small acquisition like that can have a great meaningful impact on our bottom line.","And, hey, if a big one comes along that fits our criteria, we will do that too and we have the firepower to do it. We can do a $1 billion-plus acquisition. We have that money in the tank. So I \u2013 trust me, we have been working hard. We're scouring the landscape for both small and big, but we're not going to just do a big one so we can pound our chest and do what I saw \u2013 Cody today bought a business down in Brazil. I mean, I sometimes can even not (37:17) understand some of the prices my competitors pay, and for what I don't consider to be the highest quality stuff, but we're not going to do that. We're not going to do an acquisition to say we've done an acquisition, or do a big one just to come up with some big numbers. We'll find \u2013 we've got a great history of finding the right acquisitions, big and small. They've all been winners, and that's the goal. And we are \u2013 I can only tell you we are working fast and hard on that constantly to find those acquisitions.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And just one last one on vitamins, and I apologize if I missed it. But in terms of your manufacturing, obviously, with the capacity expansion, do you guys have a cost advantage today versus your competitors from a manufacturing standpoint? And did you guys gain back any shelf space you might have lost with regard to the disruptions from last quarter?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I wouldn't say that we have a competitive advantage from a cost standpoint because remember, we expanded capacity 75% and we're still significantly under that, take us years to fill that up. So obviously, we have fixed costs that we're going to have to absorb over time. So, I wouldn't go there, Joe, from a cost perspective.","What was the second part of your question?","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","In terms of the shelf space that you guys might have lost with regard to the production issues you had last quarter.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, the shelf space that you saw, if you look at the Nielsen's for Q2, the reason why it looks like we lost points of distribution, which Jason pointed out on the last call, is because we had out of stocks. Out of stocks, when you're sold out, you show up as not having distribution. Because we're filling those back up, if you look at the Nielsen's now, you'll see that our points of distribution have grown.","As far as getting new shelf space, when you're in the penalty box, you're not going to get a lot of new shelf space for new products. As I said before, the retailers are showing growing interest now, because our fill rates are back up and we're a good supplier, they're showing growing interest in our new products for 2016.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","And Joe, I would just remind you, we have a much bigger vision for the gummy business than just vitamins. We actually hope to take that business into other OTC categories in the future and build that, we're working on that. It takes a lot more effort because of greater FDA regulations in some of those businesses, but it's not a gummy vitamin business, it's a gummy business. And we hope to take it in a lot of different directions in the future and the capacity we have enables us to do that.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks, guys and congrats and good luck, Jim. Take care.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Oh, hi. Thanks.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Good morning.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Quick one on price mix and consumer domestics. So it was flattish in the first half of the year and it jumped up about a point sequentially here in Q3. And I thought you mentioned there would be some investment behind OXICLEAN this quarter, and it sounds like you're now talking about that in fourth quarter. Did some of that maybe get pushed back? Is that a timing issue? And how do you see price mix evolving going forward here? Do you see it positive? Thanks.","Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance","Yes, so price mix \u2013 this is Rick, Joe. Price mix in Q3 was favorable, around a point, and that's largely because of those deep trade deals we didn't do as we're comping a highly promotional environment in Q3 and Q4. So, I think long term, it's still the same algorithm for us. It's largely volume, but this quarter or next quarter as we're not comping some of those trade deals we do have some benefit of price.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Cool. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm here. Sorry. I was a little bit slow today. Lots going on. But hello, Jim. I wanted to circle back on the questions on top line, many of which have been asked one way or another, so I'll regurgitate. I apologize for some of that. You mentioned OXICLEAN laundry momentum growth this quarter. As we look at the track data, the syndicated data, it actually \u2013 the trend line is kind of down and to the right, with fairly sharp declines in the last month. Can you give us a little more context? Is it fair to say that's just sort of the hangover impact of more aggressive promotions earlier in the quarter and that should normalize in a forward?","And secondly, on vitamins, we know you have some out-of-stocks, 7% strong growth. Is that reflective of how we should expect to think about that business going forward, or was there some replenishment restocking benefit in the quarter?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jason, I'd say yes and yes to your questions. Yeah, OXICLEAN, it was just the last four weeks was just an all-promotion period. We've actually been gaining distribution on OXICLEAN laundry detergent out there, and the promotions have been helping to drive that. So, we feel very confident that brand is building momentum, doing well.","And the vitamin business thing, which is your second question, that business, Matt \u2013 let Matt jump in.","Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Yeah. Jim quoted a number \u2013 sales being up 7.8%. If you look at consumption in the quarter, Jason, it's 4.9%. So, there is a bit of an imbalance in Q3, and it was reversed in Q2.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","One more \u2013 thank you for that. One more quick follow-up. We obviously look a lot at the Nielsen data because it's the only data we have. Is there anything unique happening outside of that data in terms of distribution wins, et cetera, that we should be cognizant of as we think about interpreting the data going forward?","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think I'd say it's \u2013 since you had an interest in OXICLEAN, it's that we're picking up two new retailers in Q4, and that should start scanning at some point in Q4.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good stuff. All right. Thanks, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Jim, congrats, and, yeah, good luck in your next endeavors.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll see you in the beach.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Wish I was heading there, too. Consumer international, a question there. The business has been quite strong, essentially volume driven year-to-date. I think you've guided to something like 6% growth for the year, but you've been trending quite a bit stronger than that. Can you talk about, number one, kind of the underlying kind of volume dynamic in that part of the business and what's driving the kind of upper-single-digit growth you've experienced? And then is that \u2013 are we going to see \u2013 should we expect to see a drop off from here, or is that kind of sustainable as we look out over the next few quarters? Thanks.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The business, actually in August, we called 6% full-year organic growth for international. So we raised that to 7% today. And as you know, we have a collection of different businesses. We have a European business, Canadian, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, a small business in China. They all have very, very different dynamics. In Mexico, we've been doing a terrific job in pushing ARM & HAMMER laundry down there.","In Europe, we have three brands; BATISTE, Sterimar and femfresh, which have been real horses for us, and we're doing just a terrific job with those PC brands. So this is somewhat country-by-country specific, but we've been competing extremely well in difficult markets. As you probably know, there's been consolidation in the retailers in France which we've been combating and still finding a way to grow. We're going to be calling 7% organic next year for international unlikely, but I'll still say we'll give everybody guidance on that in February.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Craigie for any closing comments.","James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, again, thank you very much. Kind of sentimental. This is my last earnings call, and I got a great team taking over. At this point forward, if you want to go down to the beaches in Florida, you'll see AG (45:23), myself and Don Canales (45:24) enjoying a fruit Corona moment. I just hope we drink the bottles instead of hitting each other with them. So, anyways, it's been a pleasure, folks, and great talking to you. Take care. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."]}}
