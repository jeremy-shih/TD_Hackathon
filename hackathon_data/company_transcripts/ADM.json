All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mark Schweitzer, Vice President, Investor Relations for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. Schweitzer, you may begin.","Mark Schweitzer - Archer Daniels Midland Company","Thank you, Jack. Good morning and welcome to ADM's third quarter earnings webcast.

I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.45. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $541 million, down 17% from the year-ago period. Although, we created value in a difficult environment this quarter, our results were below our expectations.","The operating environment in the third quarter was more challenging than we had anticipated even three months ago. Ag Services was impacted more than expected by the lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. And in Oilseeds, global crush margins were even more compressed than our outlook last quarter and we continued to experience tight origination margins in South America.","Through the quarter, we took several actions to be even more competitive in the future, including restructuring our global workforce, reconfiguring the Peoria ethanol complex, working to complete several operational start-ups, driving additional asset monetizations and further reducing costs through our Project Readiness initiative. Some of these actions had only begun to take hold in the third quarter.","As we move through the fourth quarter, we are starting to transition from the period of costs and investments in acquisitions, new innovation centers and new facilities to a period of lower capital spending and increasing benefits from these investments.","Looking at the external environment, we're starting to see the possible green shoots of recovery in certain areas of our business. However, we are not counting on a significant change in conditions for 2018.","We are continuing to drive operational efficiencies and asset monetizations that are lowering our cost of doing business and increasing our cash flow. In fact, we are taking additional actions, adjusting capital allocation among our businesses and then overall reduce capital spending level in 2018, which I will talk about in more detail later in the call.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hey. Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.45, down from the $0.59 in the prior-year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $541 million, down $109 million from the year-ago quarter.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 13%, compared to our forecasted annual tax rate of approximately 28%, due primarily to the effect of certain favorable discrete items, including return to provision and a favorable outcome of a tax position related to an acquisition, partially offset by changes in the forecasted geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and shift to higher tax jurisdictions.","Our trailing four-quarter-average ROIC of 6.4% is 60 basis points higher than the same period last year and 40 basis points above our 2017 annual WACC of 6.0%, thus generating positive EVA of $98 million on a four-quarter-trailing-average basis.","On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.45 per share. For this quarter, we had $0.12 per share charge related to asset impairments and restructuring activities, and a $0.02 per share net gain on the sales of assets and businesses, and a $0.01 per share loss on debt extinguishment.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the corporate items affecting our quarterly results. In the corporate line, net interest expense was relatively flat at $72 million versus last year.","Looking ahead, we're continuing to project net interest expense of approximately $320 million for the full-year 2017, consistent with what we indicated at the beginning of the year.","Unallocated corporate costs of $109 million were up slightly versus the prior year and below our $140 million per quarter guidance for fiscal year 2017 on lower spending for special projects and reduced employment and benefit costs. Minority interest and other charges increased by $9 million.","Turning to our cash flow statement for the first six months \u2013 first nine months on slide 6, we generated $1.6 billion from operations before working capital changes, similar to the prior year. We had favorable changes in the working capital of a bit over $500 million. Total capital spending was about $700 million. Our current expectation for fiscal year 2017 is capital spending of approximately $1 billion.","Acquisitions to-date of $187 million were primarily related to Crosswind Industries, a pet treat manufacturer; and Chamtor, a French producer of wheat-based sweeteners and starches.","We spent almost $700 million to repurchase shares, and including dividends, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first nine months.","Our average share count for the quarter was 569 million diluted shares outstanding, down 20 million from the same period one year ago. At the end of the quarter, we had 566 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30. Our balance sheet remains solid. Our operating working capital of $7.2 billion was down slightly from a year-ago period. Total debt was about $7.3 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $6.6 billion. Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%.","Our shareholders' equity of $17.6 billion was similar to the level last year. We had $4.8 billion available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add available cash, we'd access to $5.6 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next, Juan, will take us through a review of business performance. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thanks, Ray. Please turn to slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $541 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from $650 million in last year third quarter. Third quarter adjusted segment operating profit was down 17% versus the year-ago quarter.","Now, I'll review the performance of each segment. Starting on slide 9, Ag Services results were down compared with the strong prior-year period. In Merchandising and Handling, North America Grain results were negatively impacted by the lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. This led to a significant reduction in margins and a decreasing export volumes.","Global Trade generated positive earnings as our improvement actions are taking hold. While results declined from the third quarter of 2016, Global Trade benefited from international origination margins and the expansion of destination marketing businesses, offset by some losses incurred due to a lack of correlation on certain hedge positions.","Transportation results decreased from the prior-year period due to a slower start of harvest in North America, which led to lower barge freight volumes and margins. Milling and Other earnings were down due to lower volumes, though the business was still a strong contributor and maintained steady product margins.","Please, turn to slide 10. The Corn Processing team delivered another strong quarter, with results up from the year-ago period. Sweeteners and Starches had a solid performance with strong margins bolstering the North America business and our international operations continuing to provide solid contributions to overall results.","Bioproducts results were substantially higher than the year-ago quarter with ethanol benefiting from higher margins. Animal Nutrition was up over the previous year with Specialty Feed Ingredients benefiting from an improving cost position despite lower amino acid prices.","Slide 11, please. Oilseeds Processing results were lower for the quarter in an extremely challenged operating environment. Crushing and Origination results were down. Globally, crush margins remained compressed with ample meal supplies.","In North America, results were impacted by weak canola margins, partially due to higher seed costs. Our European processing business was down amid competition from significantly increased flow of mill imports from Argentina. In South America, originations remained tight due to continued low commodity prices that reduced the pace of farmer commercialization, forcing higher basis costs. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other results were lower for the quarter. Biodiesel was substantially lower than the year-ago quarter, primarily due to mark-to-market timing losses in the current quarter and weaker margins. Asia was up over the third quarter of 2016 on Wilmar results that were lower than anticipated, but still substantially higher than last year's quarter.","On slide 12, WFSI was down over the prior-year period. The WILD Flavors team delivered double-digit operating profit growth, driven by strong sales in Asia and the EMEA region. I have been very encouraged with the expansion of our customer base and channels and our focus on global accounts and targeted segments. On a year-to-date basis, our WILD Flavors sales revenues are up more than 5% on a constant currency basis. While sales revenues for Specialty Ingredients was slightly up for the quarter, overall, operating profit results were down. We continue to work through the start-up of our Campo Grande and Tianjin facilities, which had a negative impact to our third quarter results.","It's important to remember that Campo Grande is not really one facility. It's a complex of several different production lines, all of which are interconnected. Five of the six lines are now operational and we expect the sixth to be online before the end of the year. In Tianjin, we are continuing to work through production bottleneck issues at our specialty fiber facility. Setting aside the start-up issues, the Specialty Ingredients business is having a good year growing, with sales revenue up for specialty proteins, edible beans, emulsifiers, natural health and nutrition, and fibers.","Please, turn to slide 13 for an update on some of our actions this quarter. We are continuing to execute in our three primary areas of focus. We have exceeded $300 million of monetizations in 2017, and thus achieved the two-year $1 billion monetization target that we announced in 2016. In Project Readiness, we continue to make significant investments to roll out lean manufacturing processes across our facilities and standardize our business systems.","We have generated operational cost savings of almost $200 million on a run rate basis and are on pace to exceed our 2017 target of $225 million. And our 1ADM business-transformation initiative went live in the second processing business, and we are in the testing and implementation phases of our first European launch set for the first half of next year.","In Germany, we're expanding our capabilities to meet regional demand for non-GMO soybean products. And we're upgrading our Midwest milling operations. This highlights several of the actions we took in the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress as usual.","So, before we take your questions, I would like maybe to spend some time offering additional perspectives on the balance of the year and 2018. In Ag Services, we expect solid North American soybean exports and improved results in Global Trade, partially offset by continuing challenges to North American corn exports due to the competitiveness of the South American corn crop in export markets.","Generally, we think Ag Services Q4 performance should be similar to the prior-year period. In corn, we are seeing weaker ethanol margins, which should be partially offset by stronger results from Sweeteners and Starches and Animal Nutrition. That will likely lead to a fourth quarter that will be lower than Q4 2016.","I would also add that in Sweeteners and Starches, we are pleased with a good start of 2018 contracting. In Oilseeds, global market conditions will continue to impact Crushing and Origination, including South American origination, although seasonally, our North American crush operations should experience higher volumes than in the third quarter.","Our value-added Oilseeds business should deliver a solid performance. Taken altogether, we think Oilseeds is likely to deliver a similar fourth quarter to the year-ago period, excluding any benefits that we may experience if the biodiesel tax credit is approved retroactively for this year.","In WFSI, we expect WILD Flavors to continue its growth momentum in the fourth quarter and the Specialty Ingredients business should see improving results and increased contributions from our new facilities, although, we think WFSI is likely to be higher in the fourth quarter than the year-ago period.","So, looking into 2018 and beyond, we see several important factors that will positively impact value creation and growth. In terms of market conditions, while we expect some of the conditions that have impacted recent results could persist into next year, we are beginning to see green shoots of indications that point to some improvement in the margin structures of our Origination and Oilseeds Crushing businesses.","For example, global stocks of soybeans and corn are expected to start coming down after a period of build-up amid an environment of strong global demand growth. And the impact of competing feed proteins to soybean meal appears to be lessening. More importantly than external conditions, however, we believe that 2018 will be the year that we start to benefit from the full impact of recent investments and many of the aggressive actions we have taken in recent years.","Let's take them one at a time. First, as I already mentioned, we will begin harvesting the fruits of the investments we have made over the past years. We will see increased contributions from facility start-ups, particularly Campo Grande, throughout 2018, but also improvement in earnings from the Tianjin China complex and various investments across all four of our business segments, and we're not anticipating any significant start-ups or acquisition integrations that would drag down earnings in 2018 unlike what we saw in 2016 and 2017.","Second, we'll be completing the implementation of the cost and efficiency actions that we announced last quarter, and they will deliver increased benefits next year. Third, we expect to see continued growth in contributions from the longer-term transformation and investments we have made since 2014 as our portfolio management actions and our operational excellence achievements all deliver increased benefits.","All of these combined with strong demand provide us with a positive outlook for 2018 and beyond. Although, we mentioned some green shoots in Ag Services and Oilseeds, we are not counting on significant changes in operating conditions. And therefore, we are taking further actions. We will reduce our overall capital spending level to approximately $800 million in 2018 from the recent historic levels of closer to $1 billion as part of harvesting the benefits of recent investments.","And more importantly, we are reallocating capital spending away from the Origination and Oilseeds Crushing businesses, where generally there is adequate capacity, toward the value-added businesses in support of the growth portion of our strategic plan. All told, we expect a period of stronger cash flows and returns, lower CapEx needs, and an environment of strong growth demand, all of which will benefit our shareholders and place ADM on a future path of growth.","With that, operator, please, open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hey. Good morning, David.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Can you give us just a little bit of quantification for the onetime cost associated with the recent investments, things like start-up costs that have and will occur in 2017, but won't reoccur in 2018? And related to that, can you also just talk a little bit more with quantification about the operating profits that you expect that these investments could generate next year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, David, thank you for the question. So, we've been talking about Campo Grande and Tianjin, and it's just not only that, it's also we've been building the capabilities in this business. It's a business that its value proposition is resonating very strongly with customers. We are having a lot of success in generating new projects in terms of systems and solutions for our customers as they seek higher growth rates.","So, this facility, Campo Grande, for example, in Brazil, will be the best specialty proteins facility in the world. It's six facilities integrated very, very sophisticated complex and I'm very pleased to say that we are in the fifth stage out of six. So, we have only one more to bring to operations in the last quarter. But, we also built three customer innovation centers with rapid prototyping capabilities. We have one in New Jersey here in the U.S. We have one in Australia. We have another opening up now in November in Singapore, and we're going to have another one in South America. So, when you put all these things, David, together probably for 2017 so far, it has impacted operating profit that's about $30 million. So, that's a significant number for a business that is relatively new.","So, we are very pleased the way WILD Flavors have been holding that with double-digit operating profit growth, and certainly growing revenue at the rate of 5%. So we expect all these facilities that during 2016 and 2017 have been the headwinds to that business to actually become a source of profit in 2018.","And to be honest, it's not only the cost of those facilities and bringing there, but then you have also the cost of the facilities you use to actually fit the market for those facilities where you lose your normal profit because you take on businesses that have higher freight, if you will. And also these facilities have taken a lot of management attention as we bring the leadership ranks of these and we bring the facility to life.","So again, they probably mute how excited we are about WFSI. WFSI on a customer front is hitting on all cylinders, and we'll feel very proud and very excited about that in 2018.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So just to be clear, you're saying that in 2017 these owned investments result in about a negative $30 million impact headwind to the business and much of this is onetime in nature. When we go to 2018, those start-up expenses go away and then these businesses actually \u2013 can they produce positive operating profits on their own outside of the start-up expenses? That we would take that negative $30 million, reverse it, and then add to it some reasonably \u2013 or in relation to that $30 million, a positive impact from those \u2013 from all those investments? Is that the right way to think about the 2018 impact?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","David, that is correct. That is correct. Normally, it takes us with \u2013 we decided on a bolt-on and organic growth strategy, because we thought M&A, in this space, was too expensive right now. So we think it's more value creating.","I think the issue that this is more value-creating long-term, but it's probably more painful short-term, because every time you build a plant, you have 18 months of, basically, build and cost. And then the forward six months or nine months after start-up, you're not making your full range of profits from this product.","So again with different contributions, your assessment is correct. We're going to see the reversal of those costs that will not happen there. And we're going to start seeing positive contribution from those investments through 2018.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you, guys. I'll pass it along.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ann.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just to start on just some clarification. You noted that you expect corn performance to be lower in 4Q than year ago, but I don't think you told us why specifically the volume?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Ann, I think it's about ethanol. If you look at, for example, the same quarter last year, so, Q4 last year was a strong ethanol margin environment, probably in the range of maybe $0.20 or something like that. We're looking more now in the single-digit type of margins going into Q4. So that's the biggest delta.","It will be offset partially, Ann, by a stronger performance in Sweeteners and Starch and a better Animal Nutrition results, as we have improved our cost position there. But all in all, we'll not be able to offset the strong ethanol performance of same quarter last year. That's what we're saying.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, and I appreciate the color. And then on the reallocation of CapEx away from Ag Services and into the growth-year businesses or the value-added businesses.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Juan, is there some acknowledgement that Ag Services is facing some structural headwinds, just given the global glut of all three soft commodities?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, I think we have a knowledge that there is a part of Ag Services that is suffering, as you describe, some structural issues.","I would say, when we said the reallocation of capital, a couple of things at that. First of all, we do believe that the growth of production over the coming years will come from more yields and less geographic expansion. So as such, we don't foresee to have to build elevators or ports in other areas. We have built, as you know, a transit (28:55) in Argentina, and we are investing in Santos and Barcarena in Brazil. So we feel that we are complete from that perspective.","So destination marketing, which is our effort there, doesn't require the same amount of capital. And so, in general, we don't see that much of a need.","And if you think about even export capacity in North America, there is enough export capacity if the U.S. will not have simultaneous exports of soybeans and corn, because we expect South America to be competitive in corn through the first quarter.","So that's how we're thinking about it in 2018. So we feel that we need less capital going forward in that business.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll get back in line in the interest of time. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Ann.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, Adam.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So I guess the first question on Oilseeds and coming back to the 2018 comments. And generally you said seeing some possible benefits of green shoots, but not counting on significant change. And I'm trying to think about \u2013 and you talked about redirecting capital away from Oilseeds.","Now can you talk about the path to the business realizing a higher capacity utilization, both your own and at an industry level to improve the crush margins? Does the tension have to come from reduced Argentinean exports? Is it just you need a couple more years to grow into the meal demand? Can you help me think about the bridge to a better Oilseed environment from where we are today?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, sure. So a couple of things that we're seeing here. First is global meal demand is expected to accelerate in the near term. Obviously, our customers are very strong, and they've seen a strong profitability at this point in time. We've seen global animal protein production growth and some of them are actually \u2013 have announced increase in productions in new plants. So, we see that coming soon.","The other thing that we are seeing less of that we see a lessening effect are some of these substitutes. If you think about the impact of competing proteins that we have last year or this year between DDGs and feed wheat. We see that lessening and we think that that's going to continue to help the business. Think about the demand we're seeing in China being very, very strong for protein. If you think about, so far, this year when you compare to last year, crush in China has increased 11% and soybean meal destination stocks have basically stayed flat.","So it means there has been a true demand growth of 11% in China, which is very strong and we started to see also in general that price is working its way through the cycle. So, price is creating less production, if you will, in some marginal areas, but it's also increasing demand. So, it takes a while for soybean meal prices to work its way into the ration. But we always have to remember that these prices of meal \u2013 milk is always the preferred choice to feed any of these animals. This is the gold standard. So, at equal prices or lower prices certainly it's going to come back into that.","So, this is just a little bit the green shoots the environment. Of course the business has made several improvements as they went through the year and they have looked at their facilities. They have optimized some things that they needed to be optimized and they continue to be very excited about the possibilities that the value add continues to bring into the business. It has been performing very well. It has been the second best year of that business. And I would say with a little bit of a reduction in the substitute milk, feeding products, we expect Oilseeds to become a bigger contributor in profit that they were in 2017.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then, just a second question, because in the last couple years you talked to this earnings construct of, call it a $2.30 or so EPS base with $1 and $1.50 of earnings improvement from things that you could mostly control.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Has the experience to-date in 2017 led you to change the view of the base or the timing of how long it could take to realize some of those earnings?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No. Let's review the four buckets for a second for everybody's sake. The first bucket was WILD Flavors at $0.10 per year accretion and WILD Flavors has been growing operating profit 20% every year that we own them. So, we are very happy with that. That's going in the right direction. The second bucket was operational excellence and we continue to deliver those $100 million of run rate improvements every year. So, that's on track. The fourth bucket was, and I'm going to get back to the third one in a second, but the fourth bucket was buybacks, and obviously we're generating the cash flow to do that.","The third bucket is where I think I need to call your attention, and that's the one that's coming a little bit slower just because we mentioned the contribution of those assets, they were $0.10 on average, the problem that we have and I explained before when I answered David's question is in order to get those $0.10 you go through a couple of years in which you have negative impact to the P&L because you're building that plant. So, in reality, that hits you a little bit later. And we took those charges in 2016 and 2017 as we were building those projects. That's why to a certain degree now we are turning a page from that period of investments and having those costs that we never adjusted out because they are normal of cost of operations. And now in 2018, we're not going to have all those, so we were integrating small acquisitions and we were building plant. Now, you're going to see that third bucket hitting our P&L on a positive perspective from 2018 or from Q4 onwards versus what it was a negative impact, if you will, during 2016 and 2017 as we were investing.","And this was a conscious decision, as I said before, because we thought that we have an opportunity there to grow. We needed to build the capabilities that, as I said, are resonating with the customers. But we thought it was more value-creating to do it organically than given the current multiples and to do it through an acquisition in the ingredient space, so.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. That's helpful. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I guess, when I think about the Oilseeds business. You talked about the improvement or kind of holding it out next year, but can you talk about the new capacity that's coming online over the next, call it, 12 months from AGT, Perdue, all that stuff, and how does that play out? Because it seems to me that the disconnect between the forward and the cash maybe implied by that. And how are you thinking about the recovery there with the new capacity coming online?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Ken, it's Ray here. I mean, clearly, there is capacity coming online, but that's also a little bit of recognition that there is global protein growth around the world. I mean, you look at the trends, like 4% to 5% growth in terms of meal demand and protein demand. From our perspective, I mean, some of the recent \u2013 the quarter's results, they've been impacted by other factors.","I mean, clearly, when we take a look at our results in Q3, for Oilseeds, we've seen that as an example, a lot of pressure in terms of the South American crop, impacting particularly the European operations. A lot of meal actually from Argentina went over to Europe and actually caused us to have one of our lowest quarters from a crush perspective over in Europe. We actually think that, over time, will equalize itself. We actually think production levels will adjust in order to take that into account.","We've also seen, for example, on the Oilseeds results, part of it is just due to the simply South American origination. We actually entered the third quarter be more optimistic, regarding farmer commercialization. In fact, at the time of the last earnings call, we're actually seeing some good movements in terms of the crops. But what happened was the currency actually moved the other way as we moved through August, and then the farmers actually just really slowed down commercialization.","And that really resulted in our South America results being a lot lower than what we had thought. We also \u2013 in the case of Wilmar, I mean, they had a good quarter, but it's clearly below our own internal expectations, and it was about a $35 million impact versus our own internal expectations. So I think, Ken, when we look at the quarter, I think that there's certain factors that clearly impacted us. It doesn't really change our longer-term perspective on oilseeds, which is really demand continues to be robust for protein. We're seeing China continue to be very, very strong in terms of demand side. We do believe that while there are some capacity additions, we actually think that's going to be limited in some respects as the market really adjust to the crush margin levels. And I think we actually get to a level whereby there's going to be a better balance and we're going to see industry margins actually recover in the crush business.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's interesting. The second part of the question I have is when I think about China and the ethanol and where they're going to be in 2020, can you talk about the impact that would have on either corn, ethanol and DDGs and how that will affect your business?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, Ken. So, today China consumption is about 2.6 million tons, right? And ethanol is accepted or used in about 11 provinces in the country. So, when they declare that they're going to try to be ethane by 2020, that means going from 2.6 million tons that they are today to about 12 million tons. The current estimate of capacity being build there is that they're going to get to 4 million tons in 2019.","And then the government has declared their intention that by 2025, I think they would like to have a cellulosic ethanol. So, it seems difficult to see that if they're going to have 4 million tons of domestic capacity in 2019 and by 2025 they're going to be 100% cellulosic, that makes sense to build 8 million tons of ethanol capacity in \u2013 for a couple of years, if you will. And don't forget also, their ethanol is both corn and rice. So, I'm just assuming that everything is going to go corn. So, I think, at this point in time, if I think about China, if ethanol is important for reducing pollution, there are going to be better ways to reduce pollution than using corn because that is using a disproportionate amount of water that China doesn't have. So, if I'm a strategic guy in China, why will I use water to grow corn? I'd rather go into electric vehicles or importing corn.","So, to me, it's going to be more the impact of importing corn than actually the local production of DDGs. Naturally, if there is a more consumption of or production of domestic ethanol, you're going to have some DDGs. But I don't expect the impact at this point in time given the numbers and given the dynamics, I just described to be big. I probably think that that's going to be positive for us in terms of it's going to create a bigger ethanol market that, every now and then, I think we're going to export to, like we've been doing to Brazil.","And I think it's going to take some imports of corn from the U.S. As I said, when you have 22% of the world population and 6% of the water, I don't think it make a lot of sense to use that water to create fuel that you're going to burn. I think you're going to create \u2013 you're going to use that water to feed your population.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, you don't think they're going to end up using corn to make ethanol to reach the 2020...","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think they're going to use it, Ken, to reduce their stocks. I think on a forward basis, to me, personally, it doesn't make a lot of sense, as I said, to use water for that. The inventory that they have, that they need to reduce, sure, I think they're going to use that. I'm not sure they're going to be building a lot of plants beyond 3 million or 4 million tons of capacity. I'm not sure I'm going to see 12 million tons of capacity in ethanol being built in China. That's what I'm saying.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","But if you have \u2013 even in the short term, wouldn't that create a lot of DDGs which would affect the soybean meal demand? I know you said that soybean meal demand is going to be very strong. Is that not a competitor of it?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I think in the short term, yes. But all I'm saying is if they get to ethane that could be impactful. But right now, it could be a couple of million tons of DDGs, so no more than that.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, perfect.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","It's not 10 million tons of DDGs. That's what I'm saying. It's manageable.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. I appreciate.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","With the crush \u2013 I mean with the demand that is growing 11% per year, that I think, is to me the most important factor when we think about China. If demand continues to grow, all these things are sorted out and will be absorbed, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Perfect. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Welcome","Operator","Your next question comes from line Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Mark Schweitzer - Archer Daniels Midland Company","Hello Farha, are you there.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Mark Schweitzer - Archer Daniels Midland Company","Hi.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Could we just continue on the ethanol question and just talk about potential of U.S. ethanol in Mexico, how is that market developing?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I mean in Mexico as you probably have heard for \u2013 the government is actually looking towards introducing more ethanol into the market. There's about three cities that they're not looking to put it right now, but outside those three cities, they're looking actually to actually bring in additional ethanol blends up to 10% in those areas there.","So, we're rather encouraged that we should see incremental growth in that area. I know there has been some talk regarding some injunctions out there, but we think that's going to get sorted out. We do believe, for example, Mexico, is one of these markets whereby vehicle sales will continue to grow. And so, basically, consumption is going to grow in Mexico, and given the pollution considerations in Mexico, we believe ethanol is actually a fairly clean fuel that will actually help them address some of their pollution issues.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","So, how much ethanol would you anticipate going into Mexico in 2019 in longer term?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think it's about a couple hundred million gallons. I mean, I think that's what we're thinking about right now.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then...","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think, Farha, I think what you're going to see that at the current prices that ethanol is trading in the U.S., I think we're going to continue to buy demand and to open up markets. I mean, we're trading, what, $0.30 below gasoline, so imagine versus all the other oxygenates.","So I think that between pollution in, whether it's China, India, or Mexico, and the low price of ethanol, we're going to continue to see an export market that's going to be vibrant, because we're going to open up new destinations.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then could we just talk about Ag Services\/Oilseeds. And clearly the origination patterns for grain have changed in North America and South America with farmers tending to hold on to their grain. How is ADM planning for the South American harvest differently this year versus the last harvest? And how are you thinking about changing your organization in the U.S. to accommodate kind of more sporadic farmer selling rather than this consistent selling we saw historically?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Let me take a stab at that, Farha. And so in North America, I will say, we've seen a little bit of a shift maybe in the way the farmer uses ADM, if you will, and the times of the year in which the farmer uses ADM. Farmers that have consolidated, have become a little bit larger, maybe has less of a need for \u2013 in certain parts of the country for ADM to be in, for example, a truck elevator. But we continue to be very important as you know a rail elevator, if you will, or as a processor or as an export terminal.","So we see how, for example, our marketing services, the marketing offering that we are giving the farmer has become a much more complete and much more sophisticated, as it has become more difficult for the farmer to make money. The level of sophistication in how they need to make a decision has increased. And in that, our relationship has become more sophisticated, if you will.","So I think that basic things like maybe drying or storage sometimes we do less of, but we do more sophisticated things. So we see, for example, the growth of our stevedoring operations, the growth of our destination market, and the growth of our farmer services. So that's an evolution that happened over time. It's not something that happened at one shot.","In terms of South America and how are we dealing with that, South America has two elements. One is the pricing and that \u2013 the pricing of the crop. The second is the currency.","And we are, of course, making decisions on how to handle that differently every year. And at times, we get it right, and at times maybe like this year, we don't get \u2013 we didn't get it right.","So the teams are there continuing to look for that. Markets have become \u2013 farmers have become larger. So as I said also in South America, the level of the discussion and the way in which they use our Ag Services continues to evolve into more sophisticated risk management, more sophisticated commercialization contracts that we have.","So and as I said, some services that we are providing are giving us benefit that maybe we didn't get in the same proportion before. Like for example in the U.S., the U.S. right now being less competitive on a global basis, we are using a lot of our storage capacity for carries. And those carries are strong and they're giving us maybe a higher percentage of profitability that maybe export margins were giving us last year, for example.","So I will say it's a complex business in terms of it continues to shift and evolve. But maybe the problem that we're having with that is that some of this evolution doesn't happen as quickly as we will like in order to offset the decline.","We are very pleased with \u2013 as I said before, with destination marketing, for example, it's growing 10% per year and it's exceeding probably our expectations for two or three consecutive years. But it takes time when all of a sudden, you need to offset the fact that the U.S. is not competitive in corn, which is such a big volume crop.","So I think it's an evolution. I think over the couple of years, we are not worry about it. In the particular short-term, it becomes a little bit more painful like it happened in this quarter.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome, Farha.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Your line is open.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Heather.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, Heather.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","I apologize if I might ask questions that have been answered, but I was on another call earlier. But I wanted to start with ethanol. I was just wondering if the recent EPA comments regarding the RVO and with biodiesel, ethanol, et cetera, do you think those targets, those mandates are going to necessitate a much more aggressive rollout of E15 over the next two or three years? I mean, my math would suggest so, but I would love to get you all's thought on that.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Well, I just think that with the RVOs, I mean we're talking about, again, 15 billion gallons in the case of ethanol here. We're seeing the U.S. gasoline. It continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate, but it continues to grow.","On the export side, looking at next year, we're probably looking for some modest growth versus, say, the 1.3 billion gallons that we're seeing this year, 2017. So we could be up to about 1.4 billion gallons.","And then there's upside, in terms of some other markets that will develop, such as Mexico. And as Juan even indicated, in the case of China, they may decide to open up bringing in ethanol as opposed to growing corn using their water in order to make their own ethanol.","So like over time, we do see total demand for U.S. ethanol continue to move up over the medium term compared to kind of where we are at this point in time.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","I think I wasn't clear in how I phrased my question. I'm saying the 15 billion gallon mandate in our domestic \u2013 the domestic use has fallen well short of that for a sustained period of time. And biodiesel has tended to fill that gap. But as that \u2013 as we get less imports in on the biodiesel side because the anti-dumping duties and all, it just seems like that gap is going to become more difficult for biodiesel to fill. And so, my question is do you think that's going to necessitate a more aggressive rollout of E15 here in the U.S. to meet that domestic mandate?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I mean, I think that, again, looking at domestic gasoline demand, currently about 14.4 billion gallon in terms of the ethanol blend, that's probably going to move up to 14.6 billion gallons next year. So therefore, I mean, the demand side is moving up towards the 15 billion gallon level, which would be the mandate in 2018. So, we do believe that there is growth in the domestic market. It will be approaching the 15 billion gallon. It'll necessarily need to have like some of the biodiesel in order to trying to meet that particular \u2013 those RVOs there.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Heather, I think if your question is if you see excess RIN inventories dwindle to lower levels and I think that blending of E15 and higher level blends will be required going forward if that's what you're referring to that \u2013 to the need to the...","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Yeah. That was...","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Yeah.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Yeah. That's what I want. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","So, I think that's a logical conclusion and we are ready to increase those levels from our perspective.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay. And then move into China, your comments on the meal demand there. So clearly, I mean if you look at their poultry production, their beef production, just livestock production in general it's not up that much, so that growth is up actually less than a percent. So, the growth has been driven by commercialization of their livestock production as well as a move into aquaculture. And so, I was just wondering if you guys have any insight on how far long we are in that transition within their livestock production, so we get a sense of how many more years we have of that kind of robust growth there.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I'm not sure that I have that level of granularity at top of my head, Heather, to answer you. So, we may get back to you later on that. When I see production in the world, and we analyze these data and macro numbers, I'm encouraged not only by the whole growth demand in China, but also the rest of the world is when you look at the next 10 years, is a very significant percentage and is actually twice the size of the China market in that sense.","So, we not only see that growth in China and we promise we're going to get you the granularity of those by species in China, but also the rest of the world. Don't forget that. That is a significant number. When we look at the numbers \u2013 when you look at the macro numbers, Heather, to feed the world, we cannot forget some of these locations, when you add all up, in 10 years, we need another Brazil in terms of production in order to feed the world. Think about that. We don't need Brazil to grow. We need another Brazil. Where we're going to get another Brazil is the biggest question, to be honest, not where demand is going to be there. It's where we're going to get another Brazil. And that's what we \u2013 when you look at the demand in the rest of the world is if you think about in million tons, we're going to go in the rest of the world from about 130 million tons to about 160 million tons in the next eight years or something like that.","So, that's a significant number, and I'm not even mentioning China in that number. So, we feel that the demand side is not going to be the problem. The problem is, can we adjust the supply side and can we do it in a way that we can feed the world over the next 8 to 10 years.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay. Thank you for that. And my final question is sticking with Oilseeds in the U.S. Going back to Ken's question about expansion, the majority of this expansion is being done by smaller players.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","So, and that's tended to be one of the problems in Brazil and Argentina is the fragmentation and the smaller players being less rational. So, I was wondering if that is a concern of you guys for North America because it has been such a strong market. And you paint a very convincing picture of the long-term demand outstripping supply, but was wondering if you have any concerns over the next, say, two to three years of there being at least some temporary dislocation in the supply\/demand balance in the North American market.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, Heather. Always, as we look at the dynamics of every market, the competitive pressures we receive, we have some pressures come in at different times. The last year, we feel the pressure of substitutes. Certainly, some of these smaller players trying to fill up their capacity will have to make their space at the beginning.","We continue to have very well-integrated facilities not only integrated with feedstocks, but also integrated into refineries with swing capacities. So, we feel strongly about in the medium-term, long-term gain, we have the position to stay there. Will we have disruptions with some of these small players getting to the market? Yeah, they will be localized disruptions and we'll have to manage that. But we tend to manage that, as I said. Every year, there is something that we need to manage. So overall, I think we're going to be all right.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No worries.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes. Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hey, Eric. How are you?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I'm good, thanks. So, I just want to talk a little bit more, just get a little bit more cadence on the Ag Services business in the quarter. I noticed in your working capital that it was a significant cash contributor in the quarter, and this is typically a quarter where you start using a little cash, not obviously as significant as the fourth quarter, but there were just so many moving parts in that Ag Services business in the third quarter. We saw significant farmer selling early on in the quarter, then we had the water problems on Mississippi and Ohio, raised our cost, so we were even less competitive in export markets, we had a delayed harvest, just a whole confluence of just unusual events year-over-year. And you mentioned that your storage numbers should look pretty good, which I would absolutely agree to. Can you just kind of connect the dots for us one, Ray, as to the dynamics in that third quarter and you gave us a little bit of what the fourth quarter is going to look like, how does this all play out for 2018 for your Ag Services with a very unusual third quarter?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","So, just maybe some perspectives on the third quarter. First of all, you're right. I mean, it's actually a favorable environment for us to have ownership. And when you actually take a look at our inventory levels, they actually went up. So, we actually did have good ownership in order to take advantage of carries. Now, our total working capital did not go up because we actually managed the rest of the working capital, and some receivables and payables very, very effectively to offset the increase in terms of ownership that we had on the inventory side.","The other aspects of Ag Services in the third quarter was \u2013 I mean, clearly it was below our expectation and part of it's just due to the fact that just handling volumes were actually down during the quarter versus our initial expectations. In fact, handling volumes were about down 20% versus where we thought we would be. And with lower volumes that had impact on our margins. And so, our average margins versus where we thought we would be were about 50% lower in the U.S. because a lot of it is volume-driven.","The other factor is like in global trade. I mean, we had a very good quarter in global trade, but we kind of had a one-off item here in the sense that we had some hedges on some Black Sea sales on both corn and wheat. We hedged it off some North American exchanges and there was kind of like a lack of correlation between the hedge and the underlying movement. And that was about like \u2013 that was over $20 million impact for us, which is within the quarter here. So, but as we kind of look forward, we do have good ownership, there are carries in the market. We know our volumes are going to be moving up in the fourth quarter, both in terms of soybean handling and even in the case of corn, we're actually starting to see U.S. corn becoming more competitive in December now.","So that's going to be a positive story for us and that's what gives us more confidence. And frankly, we also have more visibility in terms of our look, looking into the last two months of this year than we had in terms of visibility of looking into August and September at the time of our second quarter earnings call.","So that's what gives us more confidence in terms of Ag Services for our fourth quarter in terms of an improvement versus kind of what we're seeing right now. I mean, looking at 2018, again it's still early into 2018, but we do believe that our strong ownership position will carry into the new year. And frankly, we're still seeing great global demand.","And so that should translate into some good numbers. We're seeing stocks-to-use ratios maybe stabilizing, maybe coming down. So, that could also point towards the situation where the markets may actually start normalizing a little bit and provide us with more opportunities in order to merchandise.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Ray. I got the sense that your book has to be better as well as your carries. I mean, obviously, we can see that in the cash market. So, that's what I thought was the answer and I appreciate the clarity.

On today's call, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Woertz, will provide an overview of the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results. Our Chief Operating Officer, Juan Luciano, will review our operations. Then Pat will discuss our process to acquire GrainCorp. After that, Craig Huss, our Chief Risk Officer, will join Pat, Ray and Juan during the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Please turn to Slide 4. I will now turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Ruth Ann, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter conference call. This morning, we reported first quarter net earnings of $269 million or $0.41 per share on a diluted basis. Our adjusted EPS was $0.48 per share. Segment operating profit was $630 million. As expected, this was a challenging quarter, with Agricultural Services negatively impacted by the ongoing effects of last summer's U.S. drought.","In Oilseeds, our earnings were reduced by the challenges in Brazil and also by depressed margins in cocoa. Our ethanol business improved as declining inventory supported overall industry margins, and we began to see positive results from the actions we've been taking to improve the profitability of that business.","We continue to manage through tight U.S. stocks of oilseeds and grains until the North America harvest. Demand for our products remains solid, and we will continue to leverage our global origination and processing network to serve the needs of our customers worldwide.","Earlier this afternoon, we announced that we completed our due diligence and intent to acquire GrainCorp. Following Ray and Juan's update on the quarter, I'll come back a few more -- with a few more details and provide some information on the process for that transaction.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Okay. Thanks, Pat. Slide 5 provides some financial highlights for the quarter, which I'll run through briefly. Quarterly segment operating profit was $630 million, down from last year's strong $918 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, slightly down from our tax rate in the quarter last year. Earnings per share were $0.41 on a fully diluted basis compared to last year's $0.60. And our adjusted earnings were $0.48 per share compared to last year's $0.78 per share.","In the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted earnings for the periods ending March 31. For this quarter, we had a LIFO inventory charge of $34 million or $0.03 per share. In addition, we established a reserve of $0.04 per share for the future settlement of the FCPA matter that we have previously disclosed in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks. Based upon discussions to date with various U.S. governmental regulators, we felt we had sufficient information to establish a reserve in this quarter.","In our LIFO adjusted 4-quarter trailing return on invested capital of 5.1% was 30 basis points below our WACC of 5.4%. Excluding specified items, our adjusted 4-quarter trailing ROIC of 5.5% was above our WACC by about 10 basis points. Our spread of ROIC over WACC was lower this quarter compared to the prior quarter due to weaker earnings.","Slide 6 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. Juan will talk about the business segment results in his update. Let me touch on a few items of significance in the corporate line. I mentioned LIFO earlier, a charge of $34 million for the quarter due to the impact of increasing commodity prices during the quarter on our inventory valuation compared to a charge of $107 million a year ago; interest expense of $105 million for the quarter, lower than prior year, due to the lower net debt levels. Allocated corporate expenses of $82 million were up from the $67 million level a year ago. We incurred some onetime costs associated with our fiscal year-end changes and related systems changes and some additional project costs. The other of $34 million is primarily related to the $25 million provision we booked in the quarter to cover potential assessments relating to a previously disclosed FCPA matter dating back to 2008 and earlier.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 7. We present here the cash flow statement for the quarter ending March 31, 2013 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $0.4 billion from operations before working capital changes in the quarter compared to $0.5 billion last year. Working capital changes were neutral to our cash flows this quarter compared to a large use of cash last year. Now normally in this quarter, working capital is a use of cash due to large payments we make to American farmers in the month of January. So we think we had good results in working capital management this quarter, even with these large payments.","Total capital spending for the quarter was $248 million. We are tracking towards a $1 billion capital spending level this calendar year. After changes in working capital and investments, our free cash flow was positive $100 million for the quarter compared to a large use of cash of $1.1 billion last year. We did not repurchase stock for the quarter, pending the resolution of the GrainCorp transaction and our discussions with the rating agencies. We finished out the quarter with average shares outstanding of 662 million shares on a fully diluted basis.","Slide 8 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31. For comparison, we also show the balance sheet as of March 31, 2012. Cash on hand was approximately $1.6 billion, up from the $400 million level the prior year. Our operating working capital was about $13.6 billion, down from the $15 billion level last year despite commodity prices slightly higher. We are continuing to see the benefits of our focus on working capital.","Total debt was about $8.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $7.2 billion, down significantly from the March 31, 2012 net debt balance of $9.1 billion. The $7.2 billion net debt balance is the same level as where we closed on December 31, 2012. Our shareholders' equity of $19 billion is about $0.5 billion higher from the level last year, and our ratio of net debt to total capital, excluding cash from gross debt, is 28%, much improved from the March 31, 2012 level of 33%. So we are reducing leverage and maintaining a strong balance sheet.","We had $6.3 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of March. So with our $1.6 billion of cash balances, we've had about $8 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Thanks, Ray. Good evening to everyone on the call. Beginning on Slide 9, I will take you through the highlights of each of our business segments.","Oilseeds operating profit in the first quarter was $313 million, down $229 million from the same period 1 year earlier. Year-ago results included net favorable mark-to-market timing effects of about $60 million, while this quarter, including minimal timing effects.","Crushing and origination operating profit was $156 million, down $108 million from the year-ago quarter. In North America, softseed crushing results were down from last year's strong results as tight supplies affected seed basis and capacity utilization. North American soybean crushing results were strong in the quarter, but margins and production declined through the quarter amid weaker export meal demand and lower bean availability.","In South America, higher trucking costs and reluctant farmer selling negatively impacted our results. European crushing and origination results improved from the year-ago quarter, aided by reduced imports of North and South American meal.","Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $108 million for the quarter, up $29 million, as U.S. biodiesel demand saw a modest recovery, offset by poor margin conditions in Europe. Results included about $20 million in biodiesel's blender's credits, retroactive to 2012 blending.","Cocoa and other results decreased $181 million amid weaker press margins and the absence of last year's $72 million favorable mark-to-market timing effect. Press margins were negatively impacted by the addition of industry processing capacity, lower cocoa powder prices and customer inventory reductions.","Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were up $31 million from the same period last year, principally reflecting our share of the improved results from Wilmar.","Please turn to Slide 10. As you see, corn processing operating profit of $153 million represented an increase of $20 million from the same period 1 year earlier. This quarter's results included $44 million in negative timing effects related to corn cash flow hedges that remained open at quarter end, that was up from $11 million in the same period last year. Compared to the quarter ending December 31, 2012, corn operating profit is up $150 million, primarily due to improved ethanol results.","Compared to the same period last year, sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $19 million to $76 million. When adjusting for the timing effect I mentioned, this quarter's results were an improvement over the year-ago period, a solid demand translated to tight sweetener industry capacity.","Bioproducts results increased $39 million to $77 million. Our bioproducts business is now solidly profitable compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2012, in which we had significant losses due to weak ethanol margins.","Ethanol margins improved through the first quarter as reduced inventory -- industry production rates, lower levels of imports and steady domestic demand resulted in reduced inventories and improved margins. Results also benefited from actions taken by ADM to improve the performance of its ethanol business.","Turning to Slide 11. We will see a review of our Ag Services segment. Operating profit was $151 million, down $110 million from the same period 1 year earlier.","Merchandising and handling earnings declined $62 million to $86 million, due to lower volumes of U.S. origination and exports and lower execution margins in international merchandising.","Transportation results decreased $21 million to $6 million, as lower U.S. exports reduced barge freight utilization.","Milling and other results remained steady, excluding last year's $20 million in equity income from Gruma. The milling business continued to perform well. As you recall, we sold our interest in Gruma last quarter as part of our ongoing portfolio management.","Looking ahead, we see continued impacts from the U.S. drought. We will see the seasonal shift to South America, as farmers sell more of that harvest and the industry manages the ongoing logistic challenges. And we expect ethanol margins to remain positive but volatile for the rest of 2013.","Please turn to Slide 12. As Pat mentioned earlier today, we announced our intent to acquire GrainCorp. Pat will discuss the transaction in a minute, but I would like to say a few words because I just returned from Australia, where ADM's staff and advisors have been conducting confirmatory due diligence.","While I was there, I also got the chance to meet with some of the GrainCorp team. I was extremely impressed. GrainCorp has built a great business, a great network of assets, a very talented team, and they have a culture and a business model that are very compatible with our own. In summary, an excellent platform for us to build a successful Australasia strategy.","There are still a number of milestones to come, but we could not be more excited about the prospects for this investment. Pat?","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Juan. Indeed, we are all very pleased and confident that we have driven to a very good place on this transaction. As we've said, the acquisition fits well with our growth strategy, it meets our financial objectives and it provides an excellent platform to serve growing global demand, particularly in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.","Slide 13 provides an overview of the transaction. We have completed our due diligence, and we will make a cash offer of AUD 12.20, which the GrainCorp board has indicated it will recommend. You will recall, we acquired 19.8% of GrainCorp's outstanding shares in several tranches. That was at an average cost of AUD 11.24. So the total weighted acquisition cost to us would be about AUD 12 per share.","GrainCorp, additionally, intends to pay its shareholders dividends out of current and retained earnings of AUD 1 per share. If regulatory conditions are not satisfied or waived by October 1 of this year, they will also pay an additional AUD 0.035 each month -- each full month beyond that date, subject to GrainCorp being profitable over that period. The acquisition implies an aggregate transaction value of AUD 3.4 billion, including ADM's existing ownership and GrainCorp's debt.","Slide 14 outlines the key transaction metrics. Our weighted acquisition cost, excluding synergies, represents a multiple of about 8.5x the 2013 consensus EBITDA for GrainCorp. This multiple compares favorably with recent M&A transactions in the global ag space. We expect this acquisition to be earnings accretive to ADM in the first full year. We estimate run rate synergies of AUD 50 million to AUD 70 million by the end of year 2.","Now we went into the confirmatory due diligence period with that estimate, and we were able to confirm and feel confident about that estimate, with roughly half of those synergies being cost- or efficiency-related and the other half revenue-related. Once we close the transaction and have full insight into the business, I am confident there will be additional upside opportunities.","We fully expect this investment to meet our return objectives as the synergies are realized. We think this transaction is a great win-win for both ADM and GrainCorp shareholders. We believe it delivers strong value for both companies' shareholders. For ours, it meets our key financial objectives and will help drive future earnings growth. And for the GrainCorp shareholders, they will be receiving the AUD 12.20 per share from ADM, plus dividends from GrainCorp out of earnings generated by their strong recent performance.","Slide 15 discusses our financial flexibility, funding and balance sheet implications. We have excellent financial flexibility to fund this investment. We will acquire AUD 2.2 billion of GrainCorp's remaining equity and estimated net debt of AUD 700 million. As Ray pointed out earlier, as of March 31, ADM has available liquidity of about USD 8 billion.","We expect to continue generating operating cash flows up to closing. And depending on the U.S. harvest and its impact on crop prices, working capital could also be a source of funding in the second half of the year. So we can easily finance this transaction.","As the closing approaches, we'll make a final decision on how we'll balance funding between operating cash flows and some sort of debt, and Ray will keep us up to date on this.","Turning to Slide 16. And summarizing, GrainCorp is an excellent investment for our company. You've all seen this core model chart before. It lays out both the elements of our core model and our strategy, and GrainCorp fits both. It expands the size and reach of our core model. It's keeping with our strategy of investing in Oilseeds and Ag Services outside of the U.S. and, in this case, in the Southern hemisphere. It expands the crops we handle and process, and it provides a very advantageous platform to growing Australasia destination markets.","GrainCorp has significant activity in the same value chain elements that ADM does: sourcing, transportation, processing, transforming, distribution, marketing and selling. It meets our financial objectives and will deliver good return for shareholders. All of us here at ADM are looking forward to working with the GrainCorp team and with Australian growers to build on their history of success.","So now Craig will join Juan, Ray and me for the Q&A. So Jared, if you could please open the line for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And you have a question from Farha Aslam.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Congratulations on the GrainCorp transaction.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And Pat, just starting off with GrainCorp, could you provide us any greater detail in terms of the earnings accretion you do expect? I know it's supposed to be earnings accretive in year 1, but could you provide us any detail about the scale?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, as you know, we did some confirmatory due diligence. So I think the combination of what you have noted or what can be noted from the AUD 3.4 billion of the transaction value and what we have paid per share, we look at the EBITDA forecasted with their 2013. And looking forward to 2014, I think it's reasonable to expect the $0.20 to $0.30 per share that, that math would come out to. We, of course, haven't closed the deal yet. It's a long way off. We're looking forward to spending time on it in greater detail. But again, I think with accounting work to do and the closing ahead of us, I think that's a high-level number that's probably not out of line.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then in terms of the October close, are you at all concerned about the Chinese component? Or do you have any kind of carve-outs in case there's delays for that one portion of the transaction?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, we feel good that we've planned for this. So the filings and the work underway on the time chart to get filings in place for all of the transaction, our advisors have it in progress. I don't think we can speak to the specifics of Chinese approval at this time, and we look forward to making that happen as quickly and smoothly as possible.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And just 2 quick questions on your base business. In terms of the improvement in ethanol, I think you've highlighted that going forward, margins are going to be volatile. But just kind of near term, for the second quarter, are margins materially better than what you've realized for the first quarter? It's just some near-term direction would be helpful.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Farha, this is Juan here. I think margins continue to be good at this point in time. Obviously, when margins are good for a period of time, some of the capacity may come back, so that's why we are calling the volatility. But I think we've seen the market reaction that we predicted in the previous quarter. And now, at the moment, they are healthy margins.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Healthy margins. And then if you just -- on Oilseeds, you highlighted that part of the impact was from North America and part of it was from the Brazilian and South American farmer and congestion issues. If you had to break the two, could you just give us roughly how much of an impact each was?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I will describe that the biggest impact was probably South America. I think North America was a little bit down in softseeds but offset by the good performance in Europe. I think South America was the biggest impact. And in South America was probably 50-50 between the origination business, if you will, the farmer not selling and the trucking impact in the transportation of that. So part of that will not come back, which is the trucking extra costs. Part of that will come back when the sellers sell. So...","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Oksenhendler.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Juan, I just want to -- I had a question about ethanol, in terms -- where we stand in terms of RINs available for use this year. And how many do you think will get used in 2013? And then as we roll into 2014, if there's not that many RINs available for use, is the market pretty much in balance for the whole year, maybe makes it a more stable year in ethanol?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. We share on your view there, Ryan. I think there are like 2 billion RINs available to carry into 2013. When we make the forecast for RINs available to carry into 2014, we get under 1 billion. So I think that -- we believe that E15, E85 will be needed to fulfill the mandate. So we are optimistic about our view of the '13, '14, '15 time frame for ethanol. We think that there's going to be a healthy supply-demand balance for the industry.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then also, can you -- I guess, can you talk about some of the returns on the capital that you spent over the last 12 months? It's kind of hard to see, I guess, given the drought, it's probably masking a lot of the returns. But if the cycle does turn, the normalized earnings, are they higher than they have been historically? And, I guess, can you quantify, I guess, some of the numbers on a margin or profit basis?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. I'm not sure I'm going to quantify it, Ryan. But I will say, yes, that they need to -- they're going to be higher. I think that we have expanded our earnings power through all the work that we have done in capital discipline and cost and cash. And you will see that when we have a normalized crop running through our asset base.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Driscoll.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just like to kind of come back to the quarter and then the remaining outlook for 2013. Is it fair to say that the conditions will continue to worsen in the second and in the third quarters as U.S. crop supplies dwindle even further, which should just be an ongoing and significant negative impact to Oilseeds and Ag Services, kind of the 2 biggest pieces to the pie? Is that a fair statement?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","David, Juan here. I think you've heard me say in the previous call that first quarter and second quarter will be progressively worse. And so you are correct in terms of Ag Services. Until we're going to have a new crop, we will struggle with the lack of volume. It's like a fixed cost business, if you will, in that sense. So in Oilseeds, we're going to see the shift to South America. And obviously, our footprint is bigger in North America than in South America. So from an earnings perspective, that also is an impact. So we expect second quarter to be a difficult quarter for us. Third quarter will depend on planting harvest and all that. So we are, though, very pleased with our -- the startup of our Paraguay plant. The plant performed very, very well in South America. And actually, from a profit perspective, although it's hidden in a lot of the moving parts, it actually performed above expectations in the first quarter. So we are pleased with our investments in that sense.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just 1 follow-up. Is there enough corn, in your opinion, in the United States for this summer? I note that the United States cornstalks are at 17-year lows, given -- and given the planting delays, it doesn't look like there's any chance of an early harvest. So how does that impact your thought process in the summertime for your entire corn processing segment?","Craig E. Huss","David, this is Craig. First of all, we've had a couple of things happen. With -- we've obviously ended the drought, and we're very wet, which is -- which has -- with the wet, we have much more opportunity going forward on a grain crop. We are delayed a couple of weeks. But as you know, where the corn will mature on degree days of temperature, so it's a time period, we will be very tight, we'll have to manage margins. But we've done an awful lot of work in that area, and we'll just have to let the markets play themselves out.","Operator","And your next question comes from Vincent Andrews.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you just give us your level of confidence in the 2013 GrainCorp earnings forecast? And, I guess, you're talking about going to '14. And just sort of how do you sort of bridge that with where earnings were in '11 and sort of -- we'd heard some scuttlebutt sort of throughout this process that maybe '12 was a better year than sort of was an above average year. So how do you think through that and have confidence and where things are there?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, one thing I can say, Vincent, is that when we modeled and looked at this opportunity, we really took into account the long range and the over multiple year crop conditions and earnings forecast. We realized they've had strong years and less than strong years. And actually, there was the outlook going forward by many analysts. So the consensus is that, that would come down over time. They also have some improvements planned. So I think it's more about what we can do together once we have closed on the deal. We feel confident that they can reach their earnings to pay out their dividend or they feel confident about that. That's the indication from their board. And I think it's about going forward in 2014 once we have the opportunity to reach the synergies, to assess more in detail, more than a week's worth of due diligence but assess in detail what every thing it is we can do.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then a separate question. Last week, the MLP Parity Act was reintroduced into Congress to make all sort of renewable energy assets, MLP-able. And when I saw that, I couldn't help but think of your ethanol assets and wondering whether turning those into an MLP at some point in time would be something you would be interested in.","Ray G. Young","It's Ray here. We've been studying this thing in the past. In the past, the ethanol assets weren't eligible specifically for an MLP, but I guess we're going to, again, look at studying it and look at the opportunities to see whether it makes sense.","Operator","And you have a question from Ken Zaslow.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of questions. One is -- in terms of the ethanol side, I have 2 questions. One is, are you guys running your ethanol plant at full capacity? And would -- did you run on that full capacity during the quarter?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Ken, Juan here. How are you doing? We are back at 100% capacity.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Did you run it at full capacity during the last quarter?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Not the full quarter, no. We brought it back during the quarter.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then in terms of 2014, on ethanol, how quickly do -- does the United States need to get the E15 pump to be able to actually meet the mandate?  Can you just like -- how does that work? Because I feel like the RINs are going to run out and then the E15 and the E85 pumps are really not popping up as quickly. How do the bridge work to get to the mandate?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I don't remember exactly the math, but it's not a huge number. We believe that with E85 and maybe 15%, 20% or something like that of penetration of E15, we think. But don't quote, I may have to get back to you on that. It's quoting from memory. I don't remember exactly the math.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I don't usually ask a cocoa question, but how sustainable is the -- or how long will the performance of cocoa last at this somewhat subaverage level? Is it something that gets corrected immediately? Does it turn around over a year? Can you just talk about that? It's not huge, but it's probably about a $0.05 to a $0.10 relative to expectations.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. During January and March period, the grindings exceeded consumption. And -- so if you look at the overall world, we were coming from a period in which we couldn't produce enough powder to satisfy growing demand. And there was a slowdown to that. And with the change in price direction, everybody is starting a destocking. So I would say, underlying demand is recovering, although it's an early recovery. But it's mostly a slowdown and destocking of the industry. So we think it's probably going to be impacted for this quarter and the next in that sense, until we will resume the more tight supply-demand balance.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","My last question for Ray is repurchasing stock. Could you talk about that? You said your liquidity is about $8 billion, transaction is AUD 3.5 billion, AUD 3.4 billion. Could you talk about -- will you start repurchasing stock? How does that all play out? Can you talk about the sequential share repurchase opportunities?","Ray G. Young","Yes, Ken. Again, we're committed towards mitigating the impact of the remaining dilution on these equity units, about 14 million more shares we need to repurchase. The timing, we're working through it. As you know, in terms of our -- some of our credit metrics, especially the debt-to-EBITDA metrics, due to just weaker earnings, we've got -- we had some weaker metrics. The GrainCorp transaction, we believe we can easily finance the transaction. But we do need to kind of work through the next couple of quarters in terms of getting the earnings power up and our metrics up. But again, we feel confident that we will mitigate this impact, maybe not by the end of this calendar year, but over the next couple of years, we will mitigate that impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Gurkin with Davenport & Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations on your GrainCorp news, first of all.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I had a question related to GrainCorp. I'm just curious what the strategy for developing your exposure and business in the Australasia region. Have you tempered expectations at all? There's been a lot of news, discussion about maybe there's been global overproduction of grains and proteins. Is there any reason to temper kind of expectations for growth rate in that area of the world?","Patricia A. Woertz","I don't think so. I'm not sure I'm reading the same thing you are because we're seeing expansion. Maybe if you expand what you think is Australasia to North Africa to where some of the grains go even farther West from just North of Australia, there's been some significant -- there's been growth year-on-year. Going forward, I think we have thoughts about integration in some of our already positioned imports into Asia, imports to China and so forth. And that's probably part of what we kind of talked about in that overall strategy.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the gap between adjusted ROIC and WACC narrowed in the quarter, which you explained, how should we think about that relationship as the year unfolds?","Ray G. Young","One way to think about it is, clearly, the impact of the drought is having an impact on our earnings for the purposes of the ratio there. As Juan indicated, we'll probably have more pressure going through the second quarter. But I'm pretty confident that as we kind of move through the rest of the calendar year, assuming we got a normal harvest in the United States, we should see our earnings power being restored. We're actually doing a very, very good job on our invested capital base. By the way, when you take a look at our invested capital base at the end of March compared to the end of December, we're actually lower. So we continue to do a good job on both the cost, the cash and the capital side. We'll continue to work through that over the next quarters. And so when we start having earnings recovery associated with getting to more normal U.S. crop conditions, as well as seeing the full benefit of recovery in terms of the ethanol margins, I'm confident that our spread of ROIC over WACC will improve.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just 1 more question on South America. Going into the quarter, we were expecting some logistical issues, and you all were preparing for that. What was the biggest difference versus your preparation efforts for logistics in South America? Was it the trucking industry and expenses there? Or was there something else?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Ann, I think the trucking is the most difficult. We couldn't hedge that. And I think that there were a couple of issues in the environment that may be -- that were difficult to anticipate. I think the corn export were longer and extended into February and, to a certain degree, collided also with the soybeans exports. I think that there was a new truck legislation in South America that restricted daily trucker work journey. And the thing with that transport companies, we're able to pass those cost increases in terms of higher tariffs. So the situation is getting a little bit better, but it still continues. And I think we will continue into June, July at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Michael Shlisky - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","[indiscernible] filling in for Ann. I was wondering if you could maybe first give us a brief overview. You had mentioned you would be able to meet your return goals within 3 years after you close GrainCorp. I was wondering if you can give us, Ray, some color as to what exactly those return goals are.","Ray G. Young","Yes. As you know, we've stated that our return objectives for this company is to earn 200 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital. As we look at this transaction, look at our estimates of earnings and as we look at the role of the synergies over the next 3 years, that's how we're estimating that we will achieve a return objectives by year 3.","Michael Shlisky - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And secondly, can you guys give us your latest view on some of the changes to ethanol and if they are currently being discussed in Washington D.C. and at the state level as well?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","What changes in ethanol that you're talking about?","Michael Shlisky - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","For example, the RFS Reform Act or other efforts by some of the politicians in various states to change ethanol mandates going forward.","Patricia A. Woertz","Maybe I'll take that, Mike. The -- first of all, I don't believe the RFS will be repealed. And while there is a lot of noise around this and many other subjects in Washington, if you kind of peer through it, it is a federal law. It would take agreement between House, Senate, President to change or repeal the law. We continue to feel confident about informing and educating lawmakers about the many benefits and the impacts of continued and enhanced ethanol use. So I think it stayed the course, and that's how I see it in Washington.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the GrainCorp transaction. When you look across the various segments within the business, is there any rethinking about the strategic fit as far as the mulching business? Are you still kind of early in that process? Can you provide us with any color?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Sure. This is Juan. The mulching business appeared to be a very well-run global business at GrainCorp. And if you see the earning generation and the cash flow has been very steady. So we would like to really get to know the business better over the future months. As I said, we have a weak exposure to this company. And, again, this looks like a very well-run global business. So we will take a look at it.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the European oilseed business, you suggested that it was slightly better as well. Is there anything going on within that segment that we should be aware of? And should we expect that, that can continue into Q2 and Q3 of this year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. It is better mostly because of delays in South American export in meals. So I think they have less competition in that sense. So I think that eventually, it's going to catch up and North -- South America will normalize the export of meals, and then it will revert back a little bit. But at this point, it was a good quarter for Europe oilseeds, especially soybean.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with Credit Agricole.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about maybe the GrainCorp acquisition, just in terms of what you expect with the rest of your capital spending program. And, in particular, if you could address additional investments in South America, Brazil, in specific.","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, I'll take that one, Diane. If you think about our $1 billion that we were planning to spend in 2013, we've talked about it being 50% -- over 50% outside the U.S. and, particularly, in Ag Services and Oilseeds, which GrainCorp fits, but we did not include large acquisitions like this in that number. In the same token, if you think about it, since this is mostly in our Ag Services and Oilseeds area, we're taking even a further look at the pipeline of those investments. We're happy with what we've done, both last year and up through this year. But that team is going to think forward around integration and the good opportunities that come with the acquisition. So there may be a little bit of scaling back in the next opportunity in those 2 areas. But I think we can stick under that $1 billion and still find some great opportunity and returns within the GrainCorp acquisition.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Given the timing, the expectation that it closes in October, do you expect your CapEx in '14 and '15 will be low -- will be below the $1 billion rate?","Ray G. Young","We will be going through an updated planning process. As we move into the fall, we will incorporate GrainCorp into the planning process. And based upon that, we will come up with an updated assessment as to what our capital spending plan will be going forward.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","All right. And you mentioned that fructose supply was tighter and that demand was strong. Can you talk about where your contracting is for the full year in terms of the pricing?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Diane. This is Juan. We're mostly done with our contracting, and we expect that from that perspective, our resulting margins will be in line with 2012.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just 1 further question on the corn processing group, in specific on ethanol. You did talk about the fact that you had slowed some of your plants and you were back online. But you mentioned in your press release some things you've done internally to drive the margins. Is that referring to scaling back production? Or were there other things that you did within your manufacturing base that improved your margin structure and that's something that will continue through the -- over the next few years?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","The business did a very thorough review in December. And we continue with our energy efficiency, and we continue to improve our operations from a cost perspective. But that continues to accrue every quarter. We look at things like terminals. We look at the logistics. So it was an overall review of the business, inclusive of turning down some of the capacity. So I would say, a part of that was market recovery, and part of that, we have gotten better. And you will see that incorporated in 2013 results going forward.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Is there any way to quantify what the cost saving is from maybe some of the things you've done internally to improve the efficiency of your operations?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I'd rather don't.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You have a question from Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions on corn processing. The first, I think, Ray, you mentioned a $43 million open position on corn hedging. What does that mean for the rest of the year? Does it influence your margins for the rest of the year? Or was this just kind of a onetime thing? And then secondly, on ethanol, I wanted to know if there's any like -- if there's a disincentive for competitors of yours to chase production this summer just because perhaps, there's not a lot of capacity available on freight lines just to move ethanol around. I thought I picked that up somewhere and wanted to know, if there's not a lot a of railcar capacity available, do you think that will slow competition from chasing after margins?","Ray G. Young","Rob, let me take the first one, and Juan will take the second one. Just to be clear on the $44 million, this is actually related to an accounting hedge ineffectiveness. And so just for background, Rob, if you recall back in '10 and '11, we saw a lot of volatility in our sweeteners and starches line related on hedging. And so we changed the approach towards hedging by actually designating the hedges in order to obtain cash flow hedge accounting treatment. So in effect, by matching up our hedges to our corn requirements for the different sweetener contracts, we're able to defer gains and losses on these hedges and match it up with the actual contracts. There are situations when the cash and the futures prices diverge or, stated another way, the basis moves. And when that occurs, the accounting treatment actually requires that when ineffectiveness occurs, then you have to recognize this gain or loss in the current period income. So one way to think about this, Rob, is the fact that this $44 million charge really represents an acceleration of some impacts from the future into current period. And this will reverse itself out in the future, either through the hedge becoming effective again or through just economically, we'll be purchasing corn at a more advantageous price relative to where we thought. So stated another way, we should see this impact reverse itself out over the course of the rest of the calendar year.","Craig E. Huss","Rob, on the second part of your question -- this is Craig. I would say that as we talked about earlier on the grain, we are going to add dislocations, as we have a little bit later harvest. We consider that problem a core competency of ADM. We have the railcars. We have contracts with all the major railroads. It will be difficult for people to perform in that environment, but we did it in '05, we did it last year and we'll do it again this summer and fall.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And your competition, you don't think they'll have that same access? Or is there plenty of capacity available during the summer to move corn around?","Craig E. Huss","There is capacity, I'd say, but we have the asset base. I mean, when it comes to railcars and barges, and -- it's a core competency. We've made huge investments in them. And where those may be -- we can pull them from 1 area and put them in another. As I say, we've done that in every other inverse, and we've certainly got plans in place, both barge- and rail-wise to monitor and handle that situation.","Operator","And we have no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Patricia Woertz for closing remarks.","Patricia A. Woertz","All right, good. Well, thank you, all, for joining us today, particularly at this late hour.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Case McGee, Vice President, Investor Relations, for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. McGee, you may begin.","Case McGee","Thank you, McKinsey. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we are webcasting this presentation on our website, adm.com. The replay will also be available at that address.","For those following the presentation, please turn to Slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of the comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results.","Statements are based on many assumptions and factors, including availability and prices of raw materials, market conditions, operating efficiencies, access to capital and actions of government. Any changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results.","To the extent permitted under applicable law, the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.","On today's call, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Woertz, will provide an overview of the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results. Our Chief Operating Officer, Juan Luciano, will review the drivers of our operations performance and provide an update on strategic initiatives. Then, they will take your questions.","Please turn to Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Case, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter call. This morning, we reported third quarter net earnings of $476 million or $0.72 per share on a diluted basis. Our adjusted EPS was $0.46 per share. Segment operating profit was $606 million.","The team delivered solid operating results despite the lingering effects of the 2012 U.S. drought. Oilseeds performed well, particularly in North America and in South America. Corn benefited from improved ethanol margins and ag services managed effectively through the transition to the new crop.","Looking forward, as record global crop supplies refill the pipeline, we will employ our efficient network to meet strong demand from customers around the world.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter, which I'll run through briefly. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.46 per share compared to $0.53 last year. Segment operating profit was $606 million compared to last year's $498 million. Last year's results included a $146 million impairment charge related to our investment in Gruma.","Our effective tax rate for this quarter was 32%, which is higher than the 29% rate that we booked in the second quarter. The higher effective tax rate this quarter is due to some adjustments to discrete items in our book tax expense of $12 million and a resulting true up of our prior quarter tax rates to our estimated calendar year tax rate. For forecasting purposes, you should assume that we will finish up calendar year 2013 with an average tax rate of about 30%.","Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 5.7% was 50 basis points below our weighted average cost of capital of 6.2%. During the third quarter, our 5.7% adjusted ROIC was consistent with the second quarter adjusted ROIC. But a WACC of 6.2% is up 50 basis points from the second quarter and up 60 basis points from last year, due to a combination of higher interest rates, stronger ADM stock price and a more delevered balance sheet, which I will review shortly.","Juan will provide some perspectives for our business in the fourth quarter, but we do expect the ROIC-versus-WACC spread to start turning in the fourth quarter with the quarterly ROIC-over-WACC spread to be solidly positive from improvements in earnings and in invested capital base benefiting from our focus on cash flow generation, although the 4-quarter trailing average ROIC in the fourth quarter may be closer to WACC.","On Chart 18 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted earnings for the quarter ending September 30.","For this quarter, we had a LIFO credit of $298 million or $0.28 per share. In addition, we had mark-to-market valuation gains on foreign currency hedges of $26 million or $0.02 per share related to our planned purchase of GrainCorp. We also had impairment charges of $23 million on several assets worth about $0.02 per share. And we had a quarterly tax rate adjustment of $0.02 per share related to truing up the first and second quarter tax rates to the estimated calendar year 2013 rates.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Juan will talk about the segment results in his update, but I'd like to highlight several items in the operating results. In the corn segment, we are separating out the corn hedge ineffectiveness, gains and losses. For this third quarter, we brought into results an additional $11 million of hedged mark-to-market losses that otherwise would have been deferred into the future. When Juan talks about operating results for corn, we have taken out these hedge ineffectiveness impacts in order to provide a better sense of the underlying operating performance.","In the ag services segment, included in the results were about $30 million of gains in insurance recoveries related to our property claim from 2012. We self-insured this property with the captive insurance operations and hence, there is an offsetting $30 million loss in the financial line. Results for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, and ag services also included the $146 million impairment charge related to Gruma.","Now let me touch on a few lines of items of significance in the corporate line. I mentioned LIFO earlier. A credit of $298 million for the quarter, as significant declines in commodity prices during the quarter greatly impacted our LIFO inventory reserves. That's compared to a charge of $53 million a year ago.","Interest expense of $105 million for the quarter, down from the prior year. Unallocated corporate expenses of $97 million were up from the $70 million level a year ago, due primarily to a higher special project cost, higher community investment commitments and the absence of some prior year credits.","I mentioned the mark-to-market valuation gain of $26 million related to our Australian dollar hedging. And finally, the other of negative $19 million includes some mark-to-market valuation losses related to our investment in CIP compared to some gains last year.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. We present here the cash flow statement for the 9 months ending September 30, 2013, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $1.4 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first 9 months of 2013 compared to $1.8 billion last year. Working capital changes were a source of $3.4 billion of cash in the period, compared to last year when they were a significant use of cash.","Total capital spending for the 9 months was $659 million and acquisitions amounted to $35 million. After changes in working capital and investments, our free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2013 was over $4 billion, compared to the use of cash of $600 million last year. Our cash flows are benefiting from lower commodity prices and our focus on cash flow generation. With the strong cash flows, we're able to reduce drawings [ph] on our working capital lines, such as commercial paper borrowings.","We did repurchase about 2.5 million shares during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date purchases to about $100 million or a total of about 2.8 million shares. We have about 11 million more shares to repurchase to offset the impact of the equity unit conversion. We finished out the quarter with an average of 664 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30 for both 2013 and 2012. Cash on hand was approximately $3.5 billion, up about $1.8 billion from the prior year. Our operating working capital was about $10 billion, down from the $15 billion level last year or a reduction of $5 billion. Of this reduction, about $2 billion was related to lower quantities of inventory.","Total debt was about $6.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is, debt less cash, of $3.4 billion, down significantly from the 2012 level of $8.8 billion.","Our shareholders' equity of $19.6 billion is about $1 billion higher than the level last year. Our ratio of net debt to total capital, that is, excluding cash from gross debt, is 15%, much improved from the September 30, 2012, level of 32%.","In many respects, our balance sheet leverage is low at the end of this September, impacted by the small U.S. carryout and the late U.S. harvest, as well as lower corn prices. In addition, our balance sheet is ready to fund the GrainCorp transaction when it closes, as well as the accumulation of inventory in the fourth quarter as we go through the North American harvest.","At the same time, our focus on capital efficiency and generating cash from the assets is translating into a strong balance sheet as well. We had $8.7 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we had access to about $12 billion of liquidity.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Thank you, Ray. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. We have made some changes to this portion of our presentation. My comments will focus more on the drivers of our results and our underlying performance and less on the accounting variances between periods. The slide shows both sequential results and year ago results.","So if you turn to Slide 8, I will start with segment operating profit and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments. The team managed well through the steep inverse, minimizing inventories by keeping operations running at efficient rates and our customers well supplied. This was a solid performance in a very tough environment. Our underlying segment operating profit was slightly down, both sequentially and year-over-year.","If you turn to Slide 9, starting with the oilseeds team, who managed the inverse very well in North and South America. Amid a strong foreign and domestic demand and a tight crop balance sheet, the strategic locations of our U.S. operations and the ability of our team to source and transport beans allowed us to maintain good crush rates. And as farmers brought in the harvest, that same origination and transportation network kept our plants supplied with new crop beans.","Meanwhile, in South America, our team moved large export volumes through our efficient river and port operations at the peak of the inverse, capturing strong margins. In Northern Brazil, we continued preparing our new port ahead of the harvest. Also, I want to note that our protein specialties business set a new record operating profit as we continued to grow our high value-added ingredients business.","In corn, Slide 10, margins in our sweeteners and starches business remain solid as our sweetener shipments to Mexico were relatively stable. Our ethanol team managed through continued volatility, and margins remained positive as higher gasoline demand and lower corn inventories kept supply and demand relatively balanced. We continued to identify and implement new projects to further improve our cost advantage in this business. And our renewable chemicals group had its most profitable quarter to date.","Slide 11, please. Ag services managed effectively through the crop transition and the steep inverse. As U.S. crop supplies dwindled, July and August exports from the Gulf of Mexico were seasonably low. As the large harvests began to arrive in September, exports rose to higher-than-average levels.","Our international merchandising team had a challenging quarter. And with low crop supplies, our barge business found other freight to move, including frac sand and building supplies. Once the harvest started in the Mississippi River Delta, our ARTCO barge line handled about 40% of the region's total crop.","Also, this quarter, we opened our intermodal container hub here in Decatur. This so-called inland port will allow ADM and our transportation customers to further leverage ADM's prime location, with access to 3 Class 1 railroads and 5 major U.S. highways. Our milling business continued to perform very well.","As we look to position ADM for better performance and better returns, we are focused on 3 key areas: Strengthening the core business, expanding our business and managing our portfolio.","Let me update you on Slide 12 on the 3 key areas. Strengthening the core includes our efforts on the 3 Cs: Capital, cost and cash. We are ahead of schedule in our cost management efforts. We have implemented the steps that will deliver more than half of our targeted -- target of an additional $200 million in cost reductions by the end of 2014.","In cash, we continued to benefit from the focus of the $1 billion challenge efforts created in the organization. We not only achieved $2 billion in working cash reductions, but we also elevated ADM's overall focus on cash generation. We can see that reflected in our strong cash flow again this quarter. And in capital, we remain on pace to invest around $1 billion in 2013. For 2014, we expect to be a little higher but remain under $1.5 billion for the year.","Our effort to expand the business includes our pending acquisition of GrainCorp. We are making good progress here, with 7 out of 9 jurisdictions having cleared the deal. In the third quarter, we received clearance from South Africa, Japan, the European Commission and South Korea. We continue to work with authorities in Australia and China to achieve the final approvals. Earlier this month, the Australian Treasurer issued an interim order, which commits the government to a decision by December 17 at the latest. Based on this, we expect closing to be sometime in the first quarter of 2014.","And in our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we continue to focus on cocoa. We are happy to report that business conditions improved in the third quarter, as we suggested would happen on our last call. And we're very proud of the way our team capitalized on the improved business environment. Regarding discussions about the potential sales of this business, we have no news to report.","And finally, on Slide 13, we wanted to discuss some of the factors we think will influence our business in both the fourth quarter and in 2014. As we mentioned, the world will have record supplies of corn, oilseeds and wheat. In the U.S., we are expecting a record corn crop and a very large soybean crop. In Brazil, we're anticipating record soybean planting, and we're seeing strong grains production in the Black Sea region.","These large supplies will present an excellent opportunity for us to utilize our global storage and transportation assets. They will mean lower cost inputs for our process in operations, and they will make all of our products more competitive versus substitutes.","We see strong demand for U.S. soybean exports. We expect this demand to continue, though we're mindful of significant soybean stocks held by farmers in Argentina.","Around the world, we continue to see strong global demand for oilseeds and protein meal. In the U.S., the expiration of the biodiesel blenders' credit at the end of this year is driving strong biodiesel demand in the fourth quarter. And we are encouraged by the growth of our protein specialty business in oilseeds.","The record U.S. corn harvest will mean ample supplies for ethanol production. We'll be watching industry production levels relatively to demand, and we will continue to adjust our plans to maximize our own profitability. We expect continued ethanol margin volatility.","In 2014, between favorable blending economics, expansion of E85 adoption and growing exports, we remain confident in our ethanol business. Pat?","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Juan. So just to summarize, we had solid overall performance, driven by North and South American oilseeds and improved ethanol margins, ag services managed the transition effectively. We're ahead on cost management, and we're seeing great results from our cash efforts. Looking ahead, large supplies, strong demand, lots of opportunity.","So with that, operator, if you would please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Zen -- I'm sorry, Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just have a couple of questions. One is, can you talk about the progress on the sale of the cocoa business? I don't know -- I just -- hear [ph] the update on that.","Patricia A. Woertz","Sure, Ken. Juan covered it a bit in his comments, but let me say a little more. Certainly, conditions have improved since the third quarter, and we're proud of the way the team has capitalized on that improving business environment. So that's sort of the first thing. Any discussions about the potential sale, we don't have any news to report this quarter. It is part of our disciplined approach that we look at portfolio management and evaluate everything and take into account all of what our discussions would be. But it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on any of those discussions today, so we don't have any news about the sale.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. The other 2 questions I have is with the change -- the potential change for the RFS, can you talk about your view on what that status would be and how that would actually change your outlook for ethanol margins into 2014?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Ken. Juan here. The EPA has confirmed that they have made no final decision in that regard. So to comment on rumors, it would be speculative at this point. I just think about the conditions in the market right now, with the U.S. record corn crop and corn prices having declined, the economics are very strong to blend ethanol today. Between these economics to blend, Ken, the expansion of E85 and E15 blends, the surplus reins [ph] that they are carrying to 2014 and the growing exports in ethanol as corn becomes more competitive in the U.S., we are very confident in the industry's ability to meet the 2014 [ph] corn-based requirements. So we don't see major reasons for any change in policy at this point in time.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. If there were a change in policy, would you think that the margins would be more volatile or would it not change it because of the lower corn prices? Can you just give some conceptual view on -- if there were changes, if there were -- does that change any of your outlook for 2014?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","If there were changes in policy, first, I will be highly disappointed since we've invested based on the policy and we invested it for the long term. But I will say, we continue to see export potential and that is growing. There are some experts that are talking maybe even 1 billion gallons for next year. And I think if this is a mature market in the absence of growth from the RFS, so we will manage as such and we will adjust supply and demand to maximize profitability. So we continue to expect volatility, but we are positive about margins. We continue to emphasize in a smaller market that we are at the first quartile end of the cost curve, if you will. So I think that, if you think on the long term, on a smaller potential ethanol market, it may impact the high-cost producers. And that's why I emphasized in my remarks, we continue to find opportunities to extend our cost advantage in ethanol.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you guys just talk about -- I was really surprised by how well oilseeds did during the quarter, particularly your commentary around North America. Could you talk about, I guess, what was driving that? And maybe if you can provide a little information about the mix of contributions from North America and South America, because I think everyone kind of expected South America to be good, and then kind of how you see it going forward over the next 2 or 3 quarters.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Sure, Ryan, yes. North America, as you described, had an exceptional performance this quarter. We emphasized the location of our plants to allow us to get good access to beans. But the team did an exceptional performance, running a very, very tight environment. Demand was very steady on a domestic basis, very strong on an export perspective. So we took full advantage of that. Obviously, run rates of our oilseeds were relatively lower than other quarters, but margins expanded. So I think we managed that combination very, very well. When you look at South America, we had a very strong quarter, mostly driven by origination, the corn exports and all that. As you know, our ag services business or our origination business reports under oilseeds in South America, and that's what you saw there. From a crushing perspective, the environment, as we look at Europe, even China or North America, Northern Hemisphere is strong. We expect it to be strong on a steady domestic supply in the -- domestic demand in the U.S. and as I said, a strong export meal market for probably the next 2 quarters. So we are -- we continue to be bullish about our soybeans business.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just in terms of free cash flow, it looks like you generated like $2 billion -- about $2 billion in the quarter, maybe if you could talk about the expectations going forward. It seems like grain prices have moderated since quarter end. And then the potential uses of cash because you're clearly in the middle of making a major acquisition, which -- it seems like you already have cash on hand for, I don't know, that I would expect another major acquisition, so maybe there might be something minor there in terms of M&A. But debt paydown, I don't think you paid down some more debt this quarter. Is there any reason not to expect significant share repurchase going forward?","Ray G. Young","It's Ray here. Yes, we're working through a couple of things right now. First of all, our expectation is, with a normal U.S. harvest here, we do expect grain prices to remain fairly subdued here. At the same time, there are a couple of things ahead of us. As you pointed out, the GrainCorp acquisition, we'll have to fund that. And again, our balance sheet is pretty strong, able to handle that through our operating cash flows. Secondly, we are working through our 2014 business plan at this juncture right now and are determining what kind of projects we have in front of us for next year. That will also guide us in terms of some of the capital structure considerations. Thirdly, our credit metrics. I mean, our balance sheet leverage right now is pretty good. I mean, it's come down dramatically. At the same time, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains somewhat strained, and that's due to the fact that we haven't -- due to the residual impacts of the 2012 drought, our earnings haven't been that strong. So we're looking for a recovery of the debt-to-EBITDA ratio also in order to determine how we're going to approach the share buybacks in the future. But assuming prices remain -- commodity prices remain low and assuming earnings recovery occurs and assuming no other factors to our horizon, we can see ourselves accelerating the pace of share buybacks to mitigate the impact of the equity unit dilution. As I indicated in my remarks, there's about 11 million more shares that we need to buy to fully offset the equity unit conversions. And then beyond that, we clearly are examining our -- all of our options for capital allocation, including share buybacks, with the objective, clearly, of driving returns, and as you know, our objective is to generate returns on invested capital above WACC of at least 200 basis points to over the cycle. So that's really guiding us in terms of how we're thinking through a lot of our capital allocation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Securities LLC.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to see if you had a sense of the demand side for oilseeds, specifically in the livestock industry. I think one of your competitors said that they expect customers to start refilling their inventories. So I just wanted to see if you -- when you take the pulse of your customer base, do you see that happening and do you see any rebuilding going on in the livestock industry in response to lower prices? And then just a quick follow-up, on your comment here that Europe was weak because of limited soybean availability, I always thought of Europe as a rapeseed market. So I just wanted to know why the comment there on soybeans.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Rob. This is Juan. I'm not sure I said that Europe was weak on soybean availability.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's what it says in the press release, Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Okay. Europe was -- is, as you said before, is a rapeseed market basically. We had higher raw material costs that impacted us in Europe, and a little bit of the soybean mill coming from South America put some pressure on that. But in reality, when you look -- compared to the previous year, Europe had a very good quarter. So in general, we enjoy good margins there. Going back to your original question about the customers, we see, as I said before, solid domestic demand. Customers are gaining back into profitability, and they seem to be having good prospects into the future. So we see our pipeline for continued good demand here in North America. As I said, probably until we start running out of beans, maybe Q2, Q3 next year, we see strong margins.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I just ask a quick follow-up? On high-fructose corn syrup in Mexico, there's word of potential, I guess, regulatory efforts to reduce sugar in beverages or discourage it. How are you thinking of that in your business? And is there any impact that we should consider?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. So when we look at the situation in sweeteners going forward, we see there are some headwinds, as you described. Mexico is going to have a big sugar crop, a record sugar crop that has dropped prices. And also, there are these soda tax that you described. It's difficult -- first of all, the tax is not a law yet, but it's difficult to estimate the impact that will have. We don't know exactly how it's going to impact one-serving eat [ph] items, if that's going to apply or not. And also, you have to remember that the soda marketing people are very good price managers, and I'm sure they're going to position price correctly to minimize the impact. There are some estimates -- or they are saying maybe a 5% drop in consumption. It is a speculation at this point in time. But so those are the headwinds, if you will. The tailwind, to look at it on the other side, is that our corn prices are much lower, so our products are much more competitive. And that's going to narrow some of the gap to sugar in certain parts of the world. So we're still positive about getting volumes as planned, maybe a little bit of a headwind, as you described, but I would remain very positive. This has been a relatively stable business for us, and we've been delivering volumes as per plan, so far.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","Cornell Burnette","This is Cornell Burnette in with a question for David. Okay, great. I just -- earlier, Juan, you talked about the schedule in the RFS move into 14.4 billion gallons next year. But I would say, looking at the E10 blend well [ph], that gives us just about 13 billion gallons, and the E15 seems to be coming -- becoming a bit maybe slower than maybe we would have thought in the past. So it seemed to get to that 14.4 billion metric. We would really need, I think, to be driven by E85. I just wanted to ask, what was your opinion on the adoption of E85?","And then also if you could talk a bit about E85 economics versus E10, that would be great.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Sure, yes. Cornell, I agree with you. If we look at the evolution of E15 and E85, E15 implementation, the implementation of those blends is coming slower than expected, and there are obviously issues of infrastructure there and convincing of people to switch. When we look at E85, we've seen a completely different picture there. We have already approximately 3,200 stations dispensing E85 these days. I get frequent reports -- there was a week, I think, in September where maybe something like 20, 25 work -- new stations started to dispense E85. E85 allows to, when people price it correctly, to get the full impact of the advantage that corn brings here to the table. At -- in some places, it's priced at about $1 under E10 mixture. So we see that as a really positive for us to get to the number. As I said before, there are 1 billion D6 RINs going into next year. There is E85 growth, as I said, in these 3,200 stations. When we look at the numbers of how much volume or how many gallons these E85 could represent for us, if people would price E85 low enough to entice conversion, perhaps as much as 3 billion gallons over the next 2 years could be there. So if you start thinking of potentially 1 billion gallons of exports, 1 billion RINs for next year and maybe 1 billion gallons of E85 over time, we feel very confident that we can deliver it on those numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First one is on milling. While it's smaller business for you guys, it had an exceptionally strong quarter. I was wondering if it's seasonality or anything in particular you would highlight on that milling business, and what we should look for going forward.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. Farha, this is Juan. Yes, the business was strong on seasonality. And we have, especially on the food side of it, was a strong demand. And we have an exceptional team. They execute very, very well. So all in all, a very, very solid performance. Sometimes we underestimate or undermention them just because they are so solid that they continue to deliver very good business for us.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then a harder business just for us to kind of predict is how merchandising and transportation, what we can expect with the large crop, particularly with transportation, given that we're hearing that barge rates and rail rates are going up significantly with the large crop coming in. Does that benefit you guys in the fourth quarter? Is that something that will benefit you throughout next year? Could you just give us some more color regarding transportation, and then how you expect that merchandising business to perform over the next few quarters, given that the crop is coming in late and it sounds like the initial crop is going in the bin rather going to merchandisers? Just some color around that would be really helpful.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Well, you gave already an excellent picture, Farha. This is Juan. Listen, the way we look at this is obviously, a big crop will present with -- to ADM and to ag services, an excellent opportunity to fully utilize all our assets, our fixed assets, our transportation assets, and we will work to maximize that over the several quarters. We're probably going to have a full year ahead of us of high profits for ag services. Whether they all fall in the fourth quarter or not, I mean it will depend on how do we execute based on maximizing opportunities. There may be different market situations that make us -- that some of those profits overspill into Q1 or some different situations, market conditions that make those profits to fall into Q4. I think we focused on maximizing the long term, the year, if you will, in that sense, profits for the shareholders. So don't hold us too tight on Q4 in that sense. The crop is just being harvested. It's probably 80% corn and -- 80% soybean and 60% corn. So there's still a lot of decisions that need to be made by the farmer in terms of marketing their grains and whether the market is going to put more carry or not. So at this point in time, we are excited. We've seen in Q3 already September volumes, export volumes and also transportation occupancy rates coming up significantly. So it's a good preview into what could be a strong Q4. Whether it's going to be a record Q4 or some of that will be in 2014, we'll have to see, depending on the market conditions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe another question on ethanol, and Juan, just maybe on E85, and as we think about the pace of adoption here. And I guess, I'm trying to really get a sense of how you alluded to $1 billion -- 1 billion gallons of E85 consumption. Do you think that's going to happen in the next 12 months? Or how quickly do you think we can get widespread E85 adoption, given the current corn and gasoline price environment?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. There are a lot of vehicles out there, obviously, that can use this fuel, so a lot will depend on we don't have that power to price it correctly, and I said that before. We have seen -- the number of stations dispensing E85 is growing every week, which is a very good sign that this is a profitable business and a growing business for the owners. Obviously, as I said before, it could be priced $1 or more advantage already, then that will drive more consumption. There are today 240,000 vehicles on the road today that can consume this.","Patricia A. Woertz","It's 14,000 flex fuel.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, 14,000 -- sorry, 14,000 flex fuel vehicles. So again, I think the issue will depend all on how effectively can you price it. I think making a forecast on how quickly can it grow, it could be dangerous not having the tool of pricing. But we feel that there is -- that the vehicle -- there are the number of vehicles have dared to have that kind of impact. So again, we were thinking of something about 3 billion gallons over the next 2 years. And I know -- I don't know exactly how we're going to ramp up 1 year -- in the first year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a second question on cost. And I know you've given targets for $200 million of cost out by the end of 2014. Can you -- as we look out -- as we -- as the new crop comes in and presumably, the [indiscernible] utilization, primarily in ag services, should increase meaningfully. Can you talk about how we should think about margins from the cost out -- the margin uplift from the cost out with the new crop coming in, and maybe within the portfolio where that impact is most pronounced?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. Certainly the biggest impact will be in the ag services business. The ag services business did a fantastic job last year of adjusting their variable cost to a smaller crop. But to a big extent, they are a fixed-cost business since we have all the infrastructure already built. So if you figure that volumes in the U.S. handled by our footprint may be in the range of over 20% bigger than previous year, you could have that kind of dilution of our fixed cost. So we believe there's going to be a big margin expansion in that, and -- but again, it will be that compounded with some of the dislocations and the market opportunities that the industry will present. So every year, we tend to make money in a different way, and we have an exceptional team that can adapt to do that. So we are very optimistic in having a very pronounced increase in profit in ag services by -- for 2014.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I know, in the past, you talked to merchandise -- the old merchandising and handling and transportation when they were on their own, $150 million to $200 million or so of quarterly segment profit. Is there any kind of updated view there, or is it too early to tell at this point?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I think -- listen, it's a little bit early. As I said, we only have September as a sample of this. So we would like to see how the harvest concludes and how the farmer reacts to this before making a commitment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Piken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken","A couple of quick questions. Could you talk a little bit about the impact maybe that you're seeing from some of the disease issues that are impacting the U.S. hog herd and how that might impact meal demand?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. So what you're referring is the porcine epidemic virus. Obviously, it's not a new virus, it's just new in the U.S. And we have had some reports of some cases in Iowa. At this point in time, not huge. This is all about prevention. There's no vaccine against this virus. So it's all about disinfecting and cleaning. Obviously, there's no human issue. There's no repercussion in their ability to use the protein as food. It just kills the small -- the baby pigs. But we haven't seen -- other than some reports, we haven't seen any impact in meal at this point in time. Whether it's going to come later on, it will depend on how well, again, the producers sanitize and have early detection of some of these viruses. But not -- other than some circumstantial reports, nothing significant at this point.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And then as we sort of think longer term about both meal and oil demand, on the meal side, if we think about the growth in DDGs starting to stall out with the ethanol industry reaching maturity, how do you sort of think about the long-term growth potential for meal demand globally? And then on the oil side, I guess, what do you think will happen in 2014 as the biodiesel credit expires? Do you expect to maintain the margins that you saw this quarter?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. Well, you said it. Biodiesel, we saw good margins this quarter. We've seen even better conditions in Q4, as people try to take advantage of the credit before it expires. We can't comment on what's going to happen next year. The government hasn't issued any ruling yet. And just a reminder that last year, they issued the ruling late, but it was retroactive. So it could happen again this year. Obviously, biodiesel needs of that, so margins will be different if that doesn't happen. On meal demand, I think I answered Farha before about -- we see this very solid demand in -- domestically and very strong in exports. We're even exporting a lot of the DDGs as well to China. So we continue to be very bullish about long term and higher increase in protein consumption. So all very much along the trends that we have seen and they continued to deliver. We continue to grow into the global crushing capacity because demand continues to be there quarter after quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak + Co., LLC.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","My first question is, looking at the South American crop potential coming into 2014, how are you thinking about how the operations are positioned from a transportation cost perspective? I know that kind of caught a lot of agri business players a little bit off guard last year. Do you think that the operations have kind of taken some of the key learnings from last season and are proactively implementing that, heading into 2014?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","We prepared for last year, maybe we were not prepared for the huge inverse that enticed the farmers to try to sell all at the peak of that inverse at the same time. So we continue to prepare. We are renewing some of our facilities, enlarging some others. We -- you heard us before. We are building this port in the northern part of Brazil to make sure that not all the crop needs to go through the Port of Santos, and we alleviate a little bit of that. The port is waiting for some permitting, but we are gearing up to be ready for the next harvest. That will be maybe 1 million tons of handling capacity at the beginning, in -- 3 million tons when it's completely up and running. So yes, we continue to invest. I think all the industry every year does that. Every year, production seems to grow a little bit faster than what the industry can add infrastructure to, but we continue to be committed to it.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, I've noticed that the European Union has gone ahead with some of the anti-dumping tariffs in Indonesia and Argentina. How is that impacting your European biodiesel business? Are you seeing that as a positive, and should we see that continuing forward into 2014?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Tim. It has impacted us positively, absolutely, as it reduced the competition from these 2 sources. So overall, it's a positive for ADM. We don't produce biodiesel in Argentina, and we are certainly a producer in Europe. So it's a positive for us, yes.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, one of your industry peers have -- has become more inquisitive in the milling segment. As you look out across the -- your Americas footprint, are you pretty comfortable with where you are as far as capacity on the milling side within the Americas?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, we are. I described it before. It's a very solid business. We have positions in North America, but also in Central America, very good businesses for us. If anything, what we've been investing is in more efficiency, so shutting down sometimes old facilities or consolidating 2 or 3 facilities into a new one. So we continued to be there to supply our customers and to follow on their growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Juan, can I just ask -- you mentioned Santos and there's been a problem down there, more on the sugar side than what you guys do. But from what I've been reading, it sounds like it's going to take a long time to repair and it's going to -- it's expected to sort of compound the difficult logistics that we saw last year going into next year when the harvest may actually be even larger. So how should we be thinking about that for you guys going into the South American crop next year? Maybe we just start there.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. One of the ways, as I said -- first of all, obviously, we are continuing to strengthen all our storage, our rails, our tracking contracts to make sure that we deal with that a little bit more effectively than we did last year. We are also, as we look at -- into the year and a year with more plentiful crops everywhere, we expect, as I said, to have less the -- less of an impact of the inverse like we had last year. And we think that, that -- last year, it was a combination. It was a little bit of a late harvest. It kind of came a little bit on top of -- one on top of another. So then there was a rush to sell a bit at the peak of the inverse. We expect some of those conditions may be different next year. So when you combine with being able to move some of the crop through the north in our port in Bel\u00e9m, with less of an impact of an inverse and a little bit of better infrastructure in Santos, all that combination, hopefully, will make the situation a little bit better than this year. But there's still going to be lines. We've been seeing lines for many, many years. So we just think that it will not be -- the big issue there was maybe last year.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, the -- on the USDA balance sheet for corn, in particular, the U.S. has lost a lot of export market share to South America and to the Ukraine. As we think about having a larger crop in the U.S. this year, do you anticipate the U.S. will get back a lot of that share? Are you indifferent to that, given that you have access to material in those other markets as well? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think that exports in the U.S. typically have been in the maybe 2 billion bushel range and decreased significantly last year. We expect them to come back some this year, maybe not to the level of historically. And we benefit from exports, but we also benefit from a variety of other ways, whether it's supporting our local demand here of handling, drying, storing crops at origins, if we develop big carries, we make money from that as well. So not only exports drive our ag services business. And we have also a big international merchandising business that is there to move products outside the U.S. So we are not tied exclusively to the U.S. success in exports for us to make money in ag services.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wanted to ask on your lower working capital and inventory balances. How much of that do you ascribe to the lower commodity cost? And then how much is really just because of the timing shift? We had an earlier crop last year versus this year. I mean, I see it in the process, volume is down pretty significantly year-on-year. But could you talk about -- just trying to get an idea about how you'll end the year in terms of inventory and working capital.","Ray G. Young","Yes, Diane. It's Ray here. When we -- when I talked about the working capital changes being a source of cash of about $3 billion in the first 9 months, about $1 billion of that was ascribed to really lower prices, and the rest of that is really due to just lower volumes. As we kind of think through -- moving from September 30 to December 31, I mean, clearly, depending on carries, there's an opportunity for us to build up some inventories as well. At the same time, I think that, at the end of the year, normally what happens is we also build up pretty large payable balances to farmers, to our producers here in the United States, and so that's going to be a source of cash for us as well. So while I do expect probably some buildup in working capital, I don't expect it to be that significant, especially given it looks like socomite [ph] prices will remain constrained.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. What is your view on the crop, because we didn't get a [indiscernible] report in October? And what I'm hearing is, is that the crop out in this field is actually larger, the yields are better because of the weather we've had for the last 6 weeks. So is -- what is your early read really on yields in corn and beans?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Diane, this is Juan. Yes, we've seen early reports from the field that the crop seems to be larger than expected. So we're thinking about 14 billion bushels for corn and something in the range of 3.2 billion for soybeans, probably with a little bit more variances from area to area in soybeans that -- in terms of yield. But in general, very positive results and very positive samplings from our people on the field.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And then I didn't hear a discussion on fructose contracting, I may have missed it. What is your expectations, I guess, for the crop this size and prices down for -- with your bottlers for 2014?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. As I described before, there are some headwinds in the Mexico side. Our volumes have been slightly lower than last year, but it's still above average. So we still have good, tight capacity utilization. So we're in the middle of that negotiation. So I will -- not going to -- I'm not going to say much. But I will say, we have a big capacity of shifting some of the product mix. So we have many, many products coming from these. And every year, we look at how to allocate that volume to maximize value, and part of these negotiations go into that exercise as well.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. But do you have a -- do you think you'll be done with the contracting by the end of the year? Do you think that will carry into 2014?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","It normally carries a little bit into January and February.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to ask philosophically on ethanol. With production already reaching record levels the last couple of weeks and RIN carryover is now into '14, isn't it prudent to assume that margins in ethanol should likely deteriorate as we go through '14, just on -- from a supply side part of the equation?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, this is Juan. We expect, as we go into Q4, a lower driving season and more ethanol -- more corn available for ethanol producers. So we expect pressure in our margins as we go into Q4. '14, as I said, there's going to be this increase in production at the same time that corn prices go down and ethanol becomes more internationally competitive. So it's going to be a climb in exports. And because those things never happen at the perfect timing, you're going to see volatility. But overall, we are positive '14 probably seen some pressure in margins in Q4.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the biodiesel side, should the tax credits expire, where else can you find a market for the soybean oil?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Well, biodiesel is a good option for us to divert part of the oil. Oil inventories had been drawn down during the past quarter, so they are not very big. And edible oil consumption continues to be very good. But certainly, it will be a negative if the subsidy is not renewed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with CL King & Associates.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just want to drill down a little bit more kind of in the current harvest. Are we sort of past sort of the big bulge in surge in soybeans and are we -- in soybean harvest? And are we probably right at the -- right in the middle of the corn surge as -- right now? We've seen very weak prices the last week or so, even in the last few days. And you've got a very positive carry on corn. You have no incentive right now on soybeans. So aren't we set up pretty well to have -- just with that analysis alone, forget about the drying conditions, whether you're drying more corn right now, we should be pretty well set up for some pretty strong ag services profits over the next few quarters. Is that fair?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Eric, we've been waiting for this situation for quite a while. So I would say, the team is ready. The assets have been maintained and the team is excited about executing on that environment. The environment is favorable at this point.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we could -- even on the -- even on a cash price basis, I'm seeing some elevators at $4 on corn. It's a little bit higher on a national basis. But certainly, it seems like you're getting the big surge of corn at the moment. Is that fair?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you kind of look at your -- if I look at the merchandising side, and I think your explanation earlier was pretty accurate, you are a global merchandising company. But we have seen in the past where exports just don't recover quite as quickly because we've encouraged a lot of production around the world with high corn prices the last year in places like the Ukraine and South America, Latin America. Do you think that your merchandising capabilities internationally, for example, picking up potential merchandising services out of Russia and out of the -- out of South America, could offset maybe a slower recovery in U.S. exports?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","That's a good observation. Our team in -- our origination team in Brazil is very strong and they have delivered like -- in quarters like these, very strong performance. And also, our operations in the Black Sea area are also very strong. So I feel very good about our ability to export from those regions if the U.S. is not competitive.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just quick questions on the high-fructose corn syrup and the corn sweeteners segment. Juan, you had mentioned earlier that volumes are holding in pretty nicely and that your shipments to Mexico in the quarter were pretty much flat. But when you look at the numbers, it seems like when you exclude the hedging impacts, profits in that segment were down about 20% or so in the quarter. And I just wanted to know what was driving that. And then secondly, it seems like you're booking some of the trends that we see in USDA data in terms of shipments to Mexico. The latest USDA data will have them down about 20% in the second quarter. You said you guys were about flat in the third quarter. So I wanted to know, was the industry moving at that same pace in the third quarter and things started to recover? Or are you guys just bucking the trend? And then what's your outlook for exports going forward?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","This summer was an unusual summer in which -- when I was talking about our volumes, it's also our, in general, year-to-date volumes. But the summer was a cool and wet summer at the beginning, which reduced the consumption. And I think you heard our customers also reporting lower sales. And then it picked up a bit later into the summer. We also have -- regarding your comment on the profitability, we have some asset write-offs that impacted that segment. So it's not all volume. But I would say, we -- as we look into next year, as I mentioned before, we see some headwinds in terms of our export to Mexico, either the tax or the big sugar crop that they are having over there. And we will have to see what our cost position becomes after corn settles for the next year and see how competitive we are. As I said before, we have many tools. We have many products that we use to compete for our grind. And we have an incredible good commercial and logistics network going into Mexico that makes us very, very competitive and good -- a very good supplier there. So we face the prospect of next year with cautious optimism, I would say.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Dwight Grimestad, Vice President, Investor Relations for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. Dwight Grimestad, you may begin.","Dwight Grimestad","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we are webcasting this presentation on our website, adm.com. And the replay will also be available at that address.","For those following the presentation, please turn to Slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of the comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results.","Statements are based on many assumptions and factors, including availability and prices of raw materials, market conditions, operating efficiencies, access to capital and actions of government. Any changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.","Now please turn to Slide 3. On today's call, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Woertz, will provide an overview of the quarter. Our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Juan Luciano, will review our operations and outlook. Craig Huss, our Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, will join Pat, Ray and Juan during the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Dwight, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. This morning, we reported second quarter net earnings of $80 million or $0.12 per share on a fully diluted basis. Our adjusted EPS was $0.51 and that would exclude LIFO and the impairment charges we took this quarter related to our Bioplastics business. Segment operating profit when excluding the impact of the impairment charges was $648 million.","It was a tough quarter, particularly for comparisons. Last year's segment operating profit was a record. And this quarter, we took our asset impairment charges on PHA. And the operating environment was challenging. Ongoing weakness in global oilseeds margins, lower results in corn and poor international merchandising results hurt our second quarter profits.","We remain optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of our business and the growing earnings power of our company. We continue to execute our plan to drive shareholder value. We are prioritizing capital projects, and we have adjusted our combined CapEx and M&A projections from $2 billion to $1.7 billion for this fiscal year. We are driving productivity. Our savings from these efforts should exceed $100 million when they are fully implemented. And we are returning capital to shareholders through dividend increases and share buybacks. This quarter, we returned over $300 million in capital to our shareholders.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Pat. Slide 5 provides some financial highlights for the quarter, which I'll run through briefly. As Pat noted, segment operating profit, excluding the PHA charge, was $648 million, down from the record quarterly $1.4 billion level a year ago. Quarterly net earnings, including the charges, were $80 million, down 89% from last year's second quarter.","Looking at our effective income tax rate for the quarter, we recorded taxes at 31% to bring our 6-month rate to 30%. We continued to analyze our forecast geographic mix of earnings. But for the purposes of estimating our effective tax rate for the 2012 fiscal year, we still believe a 30% rate is a good number, inclusive of the impact of the PHA charge.","Our earnings per share were $0.12 on a fully diluted basis compared to last year's $1.14. We recorded a LIFO charge of $59 million pretax or approximately $0.06 per share compared to a $0.25 charge in the same period last year. Adjusting for specified items, including LIFO and the PHA impairment charges, ADM earned $0.51 per share compared to last year's $1.20 per share. On Chart 19 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted earnings.","We also had some significant negative mark-to-market timing effects in the Other segment, which impacted our overall results by $127 million pretax or about $0.13 per share. Our 4-quarter trailing return on invested capital of 6% including the impact of the charge was below our WACC by 30 basis points. If we excluded the impact of the charge, our 4-quarter trailing ROIC would be about 7%.","Slide 6 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. Juan will talk about the business segment results in his update. Let me touch on a few items of significance in the corporate line. I talked about LIFO earlier. Market prices for our LIFO-based inventories rose in the second quarter, resulting in a charge of $59 million compared to a charge of $254 million last year. Our interest expense is lower due to lower interest rates and lower debt levels. Unallocated corporate costs are slightly higher due to labor costs and outside services. Last year's results had the positive impact of gains on interest rate swaps related to the debt remarketing.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 7. We generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations before working capital changes in the first 6 months of 2012. Working capital was a source of cash to us of $1.6 billion, as commodity prices have fallen this fiscal year versus last year's first half when there was a large use of cash.","We made capital investments of $852 million in the first 6 months of 2012. In addition, we spent $206 million in acquisitions of assets. Our net debt decreased $1.2 billion in the first half of the year. For the quarter, we returned $304 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. For the first 6 months, we returned $651 million to shareholders.","In this quarter, we bought back 6.5 million shares, bringing our fiscal year repurchases to 15 million shares. Of the 44 million shares issue related to the equity units, we have bought back to date about 27 million shares.","Slide 8 shows the highlights of our balance sheet. Second quarter cash on hand was approximately $1.5 billion. Total debt was $9.2 billion, down slightly from the level at the beginning of the quarter. We had $130 million outstanding in commercial paper, and then we had available credit capacity of $4.5 billion in U.S. commercial paper and the $1.7 billion in other global credit lines, including our accounts receivable securitizations facility.","I also want to note that of the $12.4 billion of inventories, about $8 billion is readily marketable. We believe this strong balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to manage our business in volatile markets and continue to invest for profitable growth.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review for the quarter. Juan?","Juan R. Luciano","Thanks, Ray. Good morning to everyone on the call. Beginning on Slide 9, I will take you through the highlights of each of our business segments, and then update you on our CapEx plan. I will conclude with our current assessment of market conditions and their implications for ADM.","In Oilseeds Processing, our operating profit in the second quarter was $253 million, down $72 million from the same period last year. While margin conditions in our Oilseeds segment were generally weak, the diversity of our global Oilseeds business mitigated some of these pressures.","Crushing and origination operating profit fell $61 million to $139 million. Continued weakness in global oilseeds crushing margins, particularly in Europe, reduced overall results. In response to this, we continue to take actions reducing crushing rates at European rapeseed-only plants and at European swing plants, moving some capacity from rapeseed to soybeans. Last year's second quarter reflected the $71 million pretax gain related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in Golden Peanut. In addition, last year's results included significant negative mark-to-market timing effect, which were not repeated this year.","Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $74 million for the quarter, which was essentially flat from last year. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were in line with last year, principally reflecting ADM's share of the results from equity investee, Wilmar International Ltd.","This quarter in Oilseeds, we continue to grow our international footprint. We completed the acquisition of Polish rapeseed crushing, refining, packaging and biodiesel business, Elstar Oils S.A. Our integration efforts are underway, and we're very satisfied with the assets and the team. We began a project to diversify and increased quality and efficiency at our Olomouc, Czech Republic sunflower seeds crushing and refining facility. And we announced plans to construct a biodiesel plant adjacent to ADM's existing canola crushing facility in Lloydminster, Canada.","Please turn to Slide #10. As you see, Corn Processing operating results in the second quarter showed the loss of $133 million, a decrease of $532 million from the same period one year earlier. The loss primarily reflected $339 million asset impairment charges related to the PHA renewable plastic production facility at Clinton, Iowa. Excluding the PHA impairment charges, Corn Processing operating profit of $206 million represented a $193 million decline from last year.","Overall, net corn costs were up, in part reflecting the economic hedging benefits that were recognized in the prior year and that we previously discussed. Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $46 million to $73 million, as 36% higher net corn costs more than offset higher average selling prices and sales volumes. Export demand for sweeteners remains strong.","BioProducts results in the quarter decreased $486 million to a loss of $206 million, including the negative impact of the PHA impairment charge.","In December, ethanol margins declined as additional industry capacity came online due to attractive margins seen at the beginning of the quarter and as export demand declined.","Let me comment on our decision to terminate our joint venture in PHA earlier this month. The uncertainty around projected capital and production costs, combined with the rate of market adoption, led to projected financial returns for ADM that were insufficient. We're evaluating other commercially viable options for the fermentation assets at Clinton.","We continue to look to optimize our corn business portfolio. We are pleased that our 2 new dry mills in Columbus and Cedar Rapids were able to produce at above nameplate capacities in each month of the quarter. These facilities are very cost efficient and are strategically located near very productive corn acreage. And we're currently undertaking a strategic review of our Brazil ethanol operation.","We have also completed negotiating sweetener contracts for calendar year 2012. We achieved a price increase in the low-double digits. We expect improved margins for the calendar year.","Let's turn to Slide 11. You will see a review of our Agricultural Services segment. Operating profit was $158 million, down $268 million from the very strong period one year earlier, when we were well positioned to meet the strong global demand, shipped record U.S. export volumes, and as a result, earned $426 million. The current quarter's result is consistent with the historic quarterly range of $150 million to $200 million that we have talked about in the past.","Merchandising and handling earnings decreased from last year's very strong results on poor international merchandising results and reduced U.S. grain exports. Earnings from transportation operations were steady despite lower U.S. grain export volumes.","On Slide 12, you can see highlights from our other businesses. In the second quarter, profit from ADM's other business units was $31 million, down $181 million from the same period one year earlier. In other processing, profits fell $150 million to $10 million. Results in the segments were impacted by $127 million in mark-to-market net timing losses in cocoa, which caused approximately a $0.13 per share hit to our quarterly results. Last year's results reflected the $23 million in net timing gains.","Excluding the impact of these timing effects, the results in other processing were basically comparable to last year's strong results. The underlying performance in cocoa remained strong, driven by cocoa powder demand. Wheat milling results remained steady.","Looking forward, it is difficult to estimate the impact of timing effects on our cocoa results. We have build up about $100 million of timing losses, which will eventually reverse.","In other financial, we saw a decline of $31 million to $21 million with improvements in ADM Investor Services, offset by a decline in our captive insurance operation. As we continue to optimize our asset base in these businesses, we began the permanent closure of our sorghum mill in Plainview, Texas. We will consolidate that production into our North City, Kansas mill.","Turning to Slide 13. Halfway through our fiscal year, we have invested about $850 million in CapEx, and we've spent about $200 million in acquisitions, with Elstar Oils of Poland being our major acquisition so far this year. We continue to target approximately half of our growth capital investment outside the U.S. And a significant portion of our U.S. investments will be to serve export markets.","As part of our financial discipline, we have adjusted our CapEx and M&A projection. We are looking to invest about $1.4 billion in CapEx and about $300 million in acquisitions. This total spend of about $1.7 billion is 15% lower than our prior $2 billion estimate.","Turning to Slide 14. We want to provide some perspective on current market conditions and their implications for ADM. Oilseed crush margins, while improved, remained weak and we expect continued challenges in regional margin environments. Longer-term, our global protein meal demand continues to grow, led by emerging economies. Improved capacity utilization should strengthen industry margin structure over time. We are managing our regional processing capacity to better align supply and demand.","In Corn Processing, we expect poor spot ethanol margins to continue until supply and demand are rebalanced. We are seeing a strong demand for our corn wet milling portfolio, which we expect to continue. With continued growth in industry export of high fructose corn syrup and with our calendar year 2012 contracting completed, we expect improved HFCS margins.","The South America harvest is beginning. While it will be big, it is forecast to be smaller than last year's record harvest. This should maintain the current adequate global soybean supply. And in wheat, we see an ample global supply. While we don't foresee significant crop dislocations, we're monitoring the harvest in South America and crop conditions in the Black Sea region. Crops in distress in those regions could present opportunities for increased U.S. exports. And as always, ADM will use our global origination and transportation network to help serve growing global demand.","Now I'll turn the call back to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thanks, Juan. And before we open the line and take your questions, let me just recap. Tough quarter, challenging environment, operating profits were down across the board, particularly against the record year comparison. The PHA impairment and the cocoa mark-to-market significantly impacted our results. We continue to take actions to drive our long-term performance. We remain focused on shareholder value. We increased the dividend in November. We continue to buy back shares.","So with that, Craig will join Juan, Ray and me for the Q&A. And Christie, if you could open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Let me just ask a couple of quick questions. Pat, on the last call, you made some comments about sort of what you thought the trajectory of ethanol was post the tax credit. And so we're a month after the tax credit and production hasn't given up at all, but margins are sort of bouncing around slightly above breakeven. And there was a comment, I believe, in the release about export weakness,, and exports were a big story in 2011. So could you just give us sort of a sense of where that market stands on the demand side and what your expectations are for exports this year?","Juan R. Luciano","Vincent, this is Juan. I will address the question. Remember, I told you in the last call that we were going to see a shrinking in the margins as we were going through all these changes. Obviously, exports were very good at the end of the quarter. And at this point in time, with those great margins that we have by Thanksgiving, I would say, we saw a lot of capacity coming into the market. Also, you understand that with these weather conditions, everybody can't produce at very, very high rates. So we have the industry producing at about, at the end of the year, at about 14.7% type of rate. And then we saw, after the end of the year -- normally, January is our low-mileage season for the U.S. with the winter, so we saw a decline in gasoline consumption. But we also saw the impact in exports of Brazilian reducing their mandate from 25% to 20%. So as we go into the year, we saw margins declined significantly in December although, as I told you -- I have anticipated that to you, we didn't see the magnitude and the speed at which it turned from Thanksgiving onwards. And so today, we have the situation in which probably some capacity had came out already in the last couple of weeks, so we may be producing at around 14.5%, 14.4% in the industry but we have a demand of about 12.2%. Even despite the 13.2% mandate, we have about 12.2% of current demand. And the exports are starting to pick up, but they are still reduced. And probably at this year, we are seeing something about 500 million gallons per year. That's our estimate at this point.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So just to be clear, you've got 12.2% of current demand, you mean for the full year of calendar...","Juan R. Luciano","These are current rates...","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Current rates. Okay, fine.","Juan R. Luciano","Under the same, since driving mileage are low, that's kind of the demand.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I got you. That's your run rate now, will improve seasonally and then as exports come back and obviously we'll meet the mandate and so forth. Can I ask you, I read this morning that Russia is considering an export duty on grains. And if you put that in concert with what's happening with the South American crop, how would that change sort of the fundamentals in ag services potentially?","Craig E. Huss","This is Craig. I read several releases this morning and basically, one minister says yes and one minister says no, and it comes down to politics. But we do see some seasonal issues, whether they be weather -- dry weather in Argentina or wet weather getting the harvest started in Brazil. We do have, obviously, some potential winter kill in the Soviet Union, Ukraine, all that Eastern Europe production. At this point, it's all conjecture, but they could bring opportunities to us as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Investment Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit more about Agricultural Services. So you made in your prepared comments the statement that the $150 million was within the historic range. So are you -- what were you trying to get at right with that statement? Were you trying to say that this result is kind of not a bad result? Or are you trying to say that this is just an explanatory factor in terms of the year-on-year delta? I wasn't sure what the conclusion, what the takeaway was supposed to be from that.","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, I think -- this is Pat, David. I think the idea of a range that we've tried to clarify is a somewhat average range of the past of $150 million to $200 million. And even with poor international merchandising results, which we did comment on, and slower exports out of the U.S. that we were within the range. So I guess you can take that, if you had more average of both of those, you'd be higher in the range.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then expanding on the poor international results, can you talk about why they were poor? Is this a veiled reference to kind of the European problems and how they crept into grain markets? Or is this something fundamentally specific to ADM? And then furthermore on that question, does it have a bearing on the March quarter and the rest of calendar '12?","Craig E. Huss","This is Craig. I guess  I'd say our job is to manage market volatility around our assets, and we have a very structured process for doing so. We analyzed the variables going out there and decide the risk-reward relationship in positions. And our risk positions have been somewhat lower, but it's been a difficult situation. And it's lower this year, but that's not a change in our thought process, much more just a -- we haven't seen the opportunities that we've seen in the past.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So, Craig, you're not trying to say that this had -- one of your competitors flat-out said that the European debt problems affected the grain markets and led to their business having lower origination results. I'm trying to get a sense if you agree with that statement. And then critically, what I really want to know here is what your thoughts are going forward, if this continues to negatively affect your ability to profit within ag services?","Craig E. Huss","We've not changed our process at all. I would say that carrying inventories and things like that had been a little difficult this year just because of the risk reward on them. And that's basically why we've just seen less opportunity.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Final question for me is on Oilseeds. We've seen a pickup in spot cash crushing margins in the United States. In fact, it's been fairly material on a year-over-year basis. Juan, in your comments, you made a statement that, of course, things are still weak. But I'm very curious about, number one, the spot U.S. margin impact on your business in the December quarter. And then what do you take away from the improvement in those margins on a go-forward basis? It looks material, but I'd like you to tell us if that's the fact or if it's really not as good as it otherwise appears on the spot crush.","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, David. In Q2 for us, we saw a sequential improvement versus Q1. So what we said before that we've seen, with the harvest, the situation improved a little bit. So in the U.S., margins have come up a little bit but from low levels. As we go forward, we see Europe continued concerns, especially on the rape side because of the tight supply there. The U.S., it will depend a lot what happened with South America, obviously. If you remember, a couple of years ago when South America had a bad crop, we didn't have a problem with the extra demand that the U.S. get and to have full capacity utilization of all this capacity. Now we are wrestling with capacity utilization. But it is that, is that South America becomes very competitive. So that's why I would say at this point in time, it's very much a weather market. So last week was very dry and 40 degrees in Argentina. And people start to worry, and sometimes we get a little bit of a meal export market going. And then it's raining today, it rained yesterday in Argentina, so the market's come back a little bit in soy. So it's a weather market for this quarter. But I would say despite the improvement, we still see relatively softness in the margin, in overall in Oilseeds.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you expect your Brazilian crushing margin business to be better than what your comments were for Europe rapeseed?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. We see South America kind of in between.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a couple questions. How much oilseed capacity are you guys taking out?","Juan R. Luciano","We took -- when you say taking out, Ken, if you mean permanently shut down, we shut down one that we announced last quarter. At this point in time, we're just slowing it down and we are running probably in the range of 80%, 75% depending on the oilseed. What I think I told this quarter is that, as we seen, I gave a little bit more detail of what we're doing in Europe. And we're seeing a little bit more -- we're seeing a little bit of a decline in demand in biodiesel in Germany because of -- German GDP probably has been affected by all these things. And also the winter was a little bit milder than expected, so heating oil demand is not that huge. So we shifted a little bit more to soy crush when we had that flexibility and we slowed down a little bit rape in Europe. So that's -- but that's something that we normally do, but I just wanted to give you more color.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So it's not incremented. It's the one facility in the U.S., that's really what changed.","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. We didn't shut down anything else.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then when you reduced the CapEx and acquisition capital by 15%, is it sort of expected lower cash flow, less opportunities? Or just -- why would it be there was a change in that? Like what was the reason for the change?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, I wouldn't describe it as a change. It was the continued working on our process of capital allocation that we started 6 months ago maybe. So when we started, we have like, we wanted to see the full pie chart of opportunities, the full pipeline in front of us. We saw $3.3 billion. We said okay on that. We think that $2 billion will be something reasonable. Then as we start working and increasing our hurdles and going through our prioritization, into giving priorities to outside U.S. and giving priority to Oilseed and ag services. So as we put those filters, we started to become more, a little bit tighter into that. And that's why at this point, the update is we are about $1.7 billion into that.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. How much capital are you spending on the agribusiness? And could you just kind of say how much have you spent over the last 12 months? A ballpark would be very helpful, just kind of -- because I know you're spending more on logistics. I'm just trying to figure out how much of that $2 billion -- the $1.7 billion is now on the agribusiness? How much has it been over the last year or so? Just some sort of estimate would be very helpful.","Ray G. Young","Yes, Ken. I mean, I think we've indicated -- it's Ray here, that we're targeting about 70% of our growth investments in the agri -- the ag services sector, as well as the Oilseed segment. I mean, a lot of that is targeted outside of the United States as well. I don't think we want to go beyond that, because I think how we want to think about cap allocation is what are the segments we're focused on growth, and what are the segments that we're focused on optimizing. And we're going down that path right now.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And my last question is, the ethanol exports for this year, I think at one point, you guys thought it was going to be closer to 750 million. Now I think you guys are now saying 500 million. What was the change?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, I think the 500 million is net from the imports that Brazil will bring into the U.S. So probably the gross number is probably 750 million to 800 million as we said before, Ken.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So there's no change to that?","Juan R. Luciano","No. Not in our view at this point. Too early although.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christina McGlone of Deutsche Bank.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess first question, Pat, with respect to the PHA write-down, it was an investment that was made in the pretty recent history. And I'm just curious, what changed that caused you to walk away and to write it down?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, I guess we -- as you probably know, we started an exploratory arrangement with our partner there back in 2004, and further made an alliance and investment just early 2006. But it's truly a change. In the last review of our project that looked at the economical equation -- it's kind of a calendar year budget cycle. And as the budget was brought to us with cash spending and what the outlook was and revised several times, it still could not be in the economic projections that we felt made sense to us. So we evaluated what to do and clearly, it's something where we decided to take the write-down and do the -- look at -- it's a noncash, of course, write-down. Then we'll look at those assets, as Juan has mentioned in his remarks, to see if there are other options for use of them in Clinton.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I mean, I guess just going forward, when you talk about the CapEx plans, I guess now the question would surface, is there a chance that some of these new projects would have these risks as well? Because there wasn't that much time that passed since you decided to do it, to writing it down. I mean, is there a different process in terms of evaluating the projects?","Juan R. Luciano","Christina, this is Juan. I will say that the only difference with the process is that it adds a little bit of a -- more to the hurdle rate when we go into things that we are less familiar with, like in this case. So it's difficult to compare the other projects in the pipeline where we're focusing on the things that are core to us and the businesses that we have, obviously, gross momentum in -- growth momentum in. So I think that the issue in PHA is a difficulty of us going with something that is new in the world, in a market that is completely new to us. So I don't think that you should extrapolate those difficulties into our current CapEx. Also, the current CapEx adjusted also reflect the fact that we will not have to spend extra CapEx into PHA that we had in the plan to.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Ray, for cocoa, it's the most frustrating segment to model. So we have $100 million of mark-to-market losses that eventually will reverse, but we have no idea on the timing. And then are there more losses that could happen? Or now we're kind of in a steady-state where the gains should start rolling in? How do we think about this?","Ray G. Young","Well, first of all, I think we're sympathetic with you in terms of the volatility of the mark-to-market in the cocoa segment. Christina, a lot of it's going to be a function of how cocoa bean prices move. Part of the reason why we saw the large negative mark-to-market adjustment is the fact that cocoa bean prices fell over 20% in the quarter, which is a dramatic move in a short period of time. So when Juan talks about the fact that we've built up about $100 million of cumulative losses on our balance sheet, we know that eventually, that will unwind. So as we sell down the beans or as prices move up, a lot of that should unwind. We're just hesitant to provide any indication in terms of the exact timing because frankly, it is difficult to estimate. And secondly, there's a lot of other factors that drive how the unwind will occur. So we just want to alert you that there is about a cumulative of $100 million of losses built up. It will eventually unwind. We're very -- we, ourselves, are not forecasting specifically when it's going to unwind. So we thought that was just useful information for you.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then Pat, for ethanol, it sounds like E15 may be a bit closer -- just what I've been reading seems a little more optimistic. But I wanted to understand with respect to the RVP waiver, is that a real hurdle? Is that something that needs to happen before we can have Midwest adoption of E15, assuming that the EPA puts it in the registrar?","Patricia A. Woertz","I don't know, Christina. I'm looking around the table here. To your first point of \"looks like it's closer,\" I think we still believe it's the spring. It looks like it has the opportunity to have the Is dotted and the Ts crossed, so to speak. In all the technical reviews, we don't see any reason why it won't be certified as a fuel. Illinois and Iowa are ready to go, and I believe Pennsylvania is not far behind. So the states are dispensing transport fuels -- or they have rules on dispensing transport fuels as a state component. And they are ready to go as soon as the federal approval is certified. So that part is positive. I don't know about the RVP. We can follow up and get an answer back to you on that.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, just on the rapeseed in Europe. One, is that purely a function of the short crop? So then when we get the new crop, I guess, sometime in the summer, it will -- margins will recover? Or is there something else on the demand side? I guess you mentioned the biodiesel in Germany that we should be thinking about.","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. I think even when the new crop comes, we still expect it to be tight and needing some imports from Australia to compensate for that. So I think we -- the way I think about it, Christina, is we're going to see a little bit of a margin improvement from the market and we're trying to get a lot of our own margin improvement by the things that we're doing with that. But it's still a difficult environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler of Bank of America.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Ray, I was just wondering if you can elaborate. You talked a lot -- I know last year at a conference, you talked about changing the framework in the way you make capital allocation decisions, and you provided some expectations for the investments that you were making that year. Do you plan on providing some transparency on the projects that you're spending on now? I just think it would help. I know, Pat, you talked about how you're excited about long-term earnings growth. I think that would help provide some reference for investors, how you get there. And also, do you plan on providing some targets for segments besides the Oilseeds segment?","Ray G. Young","Yes. A couple of comments, Ryan. We indicated that we were looking at our hurdle rates as part of our improved capital discipline. And Juan has talked about in the past that we have increased our hurdle rates overall. And in addition, we provide some differential hurdle rates reflective of projects that are maybe in new geographic areas or into new product types of areas, so -- and that process has been put in place. And then secondly, we indicated that we're going to continue to do a lot of smaller projects. I mean, I think I highlighted at your conference that there's a core competency within our company about doing these small bolt-on projects. And we continue to focus on a lot of these bolt-on projects, which will provide returns in excess of our hurdle rates. I think the new element that you've recently seen from us is also a focus on allocating more capital towards emerging markets or the growth areas. And so I think that through -- Juan's team, the global operating team, they're looking at all of these projects. We provide a lot more filters towards projects. And I think going forward, I think you will see that reflected in terms of our earnings power at the company, going forward. I mean, the reason why we're investing in all these projects is to drive the earnings power here. So we are going to have blips in certain quarters. I kind of view this quarter as one of these blips, whereby we kind of under-earn relative to our long-term targets. But we continue to have the capital discipline, filter the projects, look very critically in terms of what we're going to invest. I fundamentally believe that it's going to get reflected in our forward earnings in the future.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just, in terms of -- it sounds like you're evaluating some options for some of the smaller businesses like, I guess, your fermentation assets and then, I think, the sugar assets or the ethanol assets in Brazil. I guess, how far along are you in the process of this? I mean, have these businesses been a drag on earnings, or it limited your earnings growth? And kind of how far along are you in that process.?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. Ryan, this is Juan. Obviously, we made the decision on PHA based on these transient change in circumstances that we've seen late last year. And in terms of Brazil and our investment in ethanol from sugarcane, that's an important area for us. That continues to be an area of focus. And we learn a lot by operating that facility on a crop that we were not that familiar with. But fundamentally, we, like everybody in Brazil, we need to have good access to cane supply. So we are not satisfied with our current position and we're looking at options to improve that competitive position. So we are probably a couple of months into looking at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us a little color on the CapEx that you've spent year-to-date. Could you break out for us, Juan, sort of what percentage you think was spent on, obviously, maintenance; and then the piece that went towards the smaller bolt-on type projects or the ones that are sort of immediately additive, I'm assuming? And then kind of the game changers like the Paraguay oilseed crush that will take longer to have some kind of return associated with it. Just give us a framework for how those -- the bucket of spending went.","Ray G. Young","Diane, it's Ray here. I think how we want to think about on a fiscal-year basis is, in terms of just what we call the maintenance and compliance CapEx, we're still thinking we're probably running about -- around a $400 million type of number there for the fiscal year. And I'm looking at the estimates for the fiscal year right now.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great.","Ray G. Young","Okay. And then the rest would be really what we'd view as the growth type of investments. And of the growth type of investments, we're still looking to target about half of that outside of the United States, the other half within the United States. We are focused on both the combination of capital spending and M&A, and we've indicated that on the first half of the year, we spent about $200 million in M&A. In Juan's estimates, probably another $100 million to get to about $300 million for the fiscal year. And then, with respect to the organic growth initiatives, generally, how I kind of think through that is, a vast majority of the growth initiatives are smaller types of projects, which we feel very, very comfortable executing. We really -- we got good returns on those and we continue to work on those smaller types of projects, in the ones I defined as less than $25 million.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if we think about total CapEx budget of $1.4 billion minus $400 million for maintenance, that leaves $1 billion spend. I mean, you're midway through the year. You should have a pretty good idea about what percentage of that $1 billion will be on the smaller projects. Is it 70%? 80%? Just...","Ray G. Young","Yes. I think a ballpark number is probably about 3\/4 of it is probably in the smaller projects.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","3\/4. Okay, great. And then I just had a question on the comment on the ethanol business. I think you said you were running above the nameplate in the December quarter. Is that -- it just sort of shocks me because the BioProducts profit was actually below my expectations, despite what seemed to be fairly decent industry results. So I just am -- I'm curious about the thought process that went behind -- with where corn prices are versus where ethanol prices are. You're running above your capacity still, or kind of how are you adjusting to the reduced operating environment?","Juan R. Luciano","The industry is running all very hard, to be honest, Diane. And we run very hard through the quarter, in the past quarter, as we saw those spectacular margins. Then obviously demand, especially on exports, disappear on that. We continue to run hard those plants, Diane. Those plants are not similar to the oilseeds plant, that allows for big adjustments in capacity utilization without taking a big hit on costs. Those plants are very big, are very intensive on energy. So we think that we have the cost advantage and we think that in reality, slowing down our plants will not bring a significant benefit to us, as it happens maybe in oilseeds. So we continue to run them hard and I think that we believe that some of the smaller players will slow down. They have slowed down already a little bit during the quarter.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds -- the question is, is that 6 months? Or I mean, there was a period, I guess a couple of years ago, where you had basically 4 quarters of losses in that group or in that line item. Is that kind of what we're looking at here? Or is it may be not as bad as it was 2 to 3 years ago?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. I'm thinking, Diane, less than that, certainly. I think that there's going to be a combination. I think that the driving season in the U.S. is going to pick up. I think exports with these ethanol prices will pick up and it's just a matter of putting the programs together take a little bit of time. And I think there also some of the smaller player, the less competitive players will also adjust their capacity. There's also a mid-annual -- or semi-annual shutdown for maintenance of these plants, that normally happen too. So we see that, with all that, probably at the end of this quarter, we should see a little bit of a pickup in the ethanol margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Healy of Scotiabank.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Just a couple of questions for you. First, just on your ag services business. I'm just curious if you're seeing any impact at all from the rise in U.S. on-farm storage? I saw that rose again in 2011. Have you seen since harvest that farmers are holding on to their grain a bit more tightly?","Craig E. Huss","This is Craig. I think that on-farm storage is an issue, but I think much bigger than that is the farmer's holding on to the crop, period. Whether he was holding onto it on-farm or at the country elevator or at the terminal is insignificant. The farmer's had fairly strong financial results over the past few years and he's capable of holding and he's being bullish. So I don't think -- I think it's obvious that we have continued to have an increase of on-farm storage. But I think it's farmer holding of the crop much more than on-farm storage which has created the strong basis.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","And did you see that improve in mid-December, when the prices started to come back up? Has that improved since the last quarter?","Craig E. Huss","Well, the farmer has a situation where he is very strong, but there's a very strong inverse, where the old crop is worth more than the new crops. So he will gradually start selling the new crop because it's a financial hindrance for him to sell new crop.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Okay. And then just moving on to your growth plans here. You recently announced several expansions in Europe, Romania and Poland, Slovakia. Maybe you can talk about Ukraine. Is that a focused market for you? And what opportunities would you see in that particular market? Would that be more likely be a build versus a buy situation?","Juan R. Luciano","Christine, this is Juan. We're certainly building our position in Eastern Europe, so you see all these elevators and they're bringing it -- it's building our origination. We already have some processing capacity there. So we try to do more in terms of acquisition because there are smaller players there. So we have a very aggressive team and I think that you're seeing some of those results posted in our announcements over the last couple of months. So we will continue to do that. And acquisition game is a game of percentages, so it's very difficult to forecast. But we feel satisfied with the rate that we're going.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","My understanding though, just from some of your competitors, is there's a bit of a lack of opportunities in Ukraine in particular. Do you see that particular market as more tricky to grow?","Juan R. Luciano","In terms of acquisition, you have seen that our forecast had been reduced for the rest of the year. So you may say that some of those opportunities that we thought originally were going to be there are either no longer attractive or no longer available, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple quick ones. First, you commented on ethanol dynamics post the expiration of the subsidy. I was hoping you can give us an update on the biodiesel side, and whether you're seeing RIN carryover from last year, whether your expectation is that end demand will ultimately be lower than what the mandate called for?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. Lindsay, this is Juan. Certainly, we're seeing a little bit of a hangover from the inventory buildup on Biodiesel 99 at the end of the calendar year in 2001. And we think that, that is weighting heavily on demand for probably the first 2 months of this year. We are starting to see some better business interest, although margins are still not great. I would say, on the -- so we think that we're going to make the 1 billion gallons of the mandate. Certainly, the industry has the ability to do that in a shorter period of time, so they can start midyear and they can still catch up. On the positive side, on biodiesel, I will say, the EPA has finalized the ruling on palm-based biodiesel and have ruled that they do not need the 20% greenhouse gas reduction, emissions reductions. So that will be a positive for the domestic industry since we don't have to compete with palm-based imports.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I also just wanted to clarify, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks an expectation that South American crop would actually be lower on a year-over-year basis. And I know they are lower than where people had thought they'd be because of some of the weather issues. But unless I'm mistaken, I still thought that we were looking for an increase in the absolute output on a year-over-year basis, at least as far as what WASI [ph] and some of the other organizations are looking for. So do you have a different view? Or am I misunderstanding your expectation?","Craig E. Huss","This is Craig. I think that we are looking for smaller crops than last year. It's all conjecture at this point because we have just started actually bringing the crop in, in Brazil. But the dry weather in Argentina has had an impact on corn for certain, and it had some impact on beans. But as in the United States, it's August rains here. Well, it's the late January and February rains in Argentina that are going to make or break that crop. So we're not necessarily estimating where it will be, but it's going to be lower than we would have said 6 weeks ago, for certain.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one of your competitors in the U.S. announced, I believe, another crushing plant closure. Are you seeing -- first of all, do you have facilities that are in close proximity to that one? Would you expect to see some immediate benefit in terms of your P&L as a result? And are you seeing that impact flow through?","Juan R. Luciano","We think that in general the producers in the U.S. have been reacting to the difficult demand situation and have been disciplined in managing their capacity. So I think that everybody will benefit when we have that situation.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, if you could just maybe go around the horn. I know that you have crushing capability in lots of different regions. So which of your regions, Europe, U.S., is most profitable on a gross margin basis? How would you rank-order them?","Juan R. Luciano","I will rank, as I think I said before, U.S., South America and Europe, in that order.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","The $100 million on timing losses in cocoa that you mentioned, should we assume any timing issues going forward in either corn or soy would be smaller than that, since you haven't called them out?","Ray G. Young","Yes. Actually, John, if you recall last year, we had quite a bit of mark-to-market impacts in the Oilseeds segment. We've been able to mitigate that impact through some differences in terms of how we're treating the valuation. So that's the reason you should not see mark-to-market impacts or timing impacts flowing through the Oilseed segment going forward. They were very, very significant last year in the second quarter,  as you recall. Now going forward in the cocoa segment, we're actually looking at ways to try to mitigate that mark-to-market impact as well. So we're looking at techniques in order to provide a more consistent treatment with respect to the inventories, as well as the hedges. So that's a work in progress and we'll report back when we find a method to try to mitigate that impact. In the corn segment, if you recall last year in the second quarter, we had some fairly significant mark-to-market gains in the corn segment due to our ownership position when prices moved up. I think we highlighted that in this particular quarter, we didn't have the consumer types of ownership gains. But it did have an impact in our net corn costs because we recognized the benefits last year in the second quarter which, economically, one can argue that really would have accrued to this particular quarter. And so remember, John, if you recall at the last quarter's call, we said approximately $100 million of the benefits in the second quarter of last year with respect to hedging would have accrued to really the first and second quarter of this fiscal year.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. I was asking specifically more about the forward couple of quarters here. And there's nothing known, major in soy or corn at this point.","Ray G. Young","As you know, John, we don't comment on our positions here. So I think -- I just want to make sure you understood some of the accounting issues regarding mark-to-market. But again, we don't comment on our positions going forward.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And again, could you remind us how much high fructose corn syrup -- what the revenue impact is going to be from the pricing rolling forward here in the new contracts?","Juan R. Luciano","Well, the price increases are in the -- we say in the low teens, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Continuing along with HFCS, is that -- does that come in line with expectations or marginally better? Can you give any kind of color on that?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. I would say that when you finish this, this was a long process and there are many people -- or many players involved. When we finish all that, considering where we land in the volumes and the prices, I would say we are satisfied.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then Pat, and just your comments in the release about growing earnings power of ADM. We've seen 3 quarters now of down earnings year-over-year. And I guess, what is behind that statement? Can you help me reconcile what we're seeing come through the earnings versus that statement?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, I think it relates back to also another question earlier. And as Ray responded, we're looking very carefully at all of our future investments and they're all related to creating earnings power in the long term. So the long term doesn't always mean the next quarter. Although it's helpful if you see quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter improvement. This happens to be a down period relative to the external environment. But our costs to -- our objective to be above our cost of capital by 2 points -- 200 basis points is very, very important. We're also under -- if you think about our productivity efforts, which we have underway for a while, we're looking at every aspect of our cost, of our cost lines, looking at the organization structure to allow for even greater productivity. And we expect over the next several quarters to see $100 million pretax benefit from those productivity efforts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine McCracken of Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just wanted to touch on a couple of quick things. We've been hearing a little bit about some wheat and soymilk quality issues potentially impacting exports. I'm just wondering if that's going to [ph] be a factor in your business and if you can provide any color around that?","Ray G. Young","Are you talking international? U.S.?","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","U.S. wheat. Apparently, there were some issues here over the past few weeks, soy meal specifically as well. We've been hearing some issues possibly impacting exports to China.","Ray G. Young","No. I don't -- quality is always an issue, but I don't see anything outside the norm. As we've -- as we get later in the crop at Eastern Europe, we're seeing a few quality issues over there. But certainly nothing outside the norm. And on wheat, it's been mostly a competitive issue, not a quality issue as getting U.S. wheat competitive in the world markets. And it's basically in that neighborhood right now.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","All right. And then what do you make of China's move yesterday to ban Indian rapeseed import due to quality issues specifically? Is that a retaliatory measure or do you think there's something -- a real concern there?","Ray G. Young","Probably some of both, as in most decisions that come out of China. But there is a quality issue and there's probably politics there also. But it's just part of the markets.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","And do you see that as a potential benefit then? Any way to quantify how a big of a potential opportunity that might be for some of your markets?","Ray G. Young","Any dislocation can be an opportunity, it depends on degree.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Fair enough. And then one last one, a separate question on the low carbon fuel standard decision in California, I know that's being appealed. But have you seen any change as it relates to your business and that announcement?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, I'll take that, Christine. The courts have ruled on that and while there'll probably always be an appeal process in California, I think it's a positive for the industry that the level playing field, so to speak, kind of was the successor at the end of the day. And that should be positive for U.S. ethanol as opposed to a lot of imported ethanol into California.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","But nothing specific is moving into that market at this point?","Patricia A. Woertz","Nothing in the current place. We're still shipping and we have good ethanol moving into the California market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Investment Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. Ray, on the cocoa, just to make sure I'm clear on this one. So the mark-to-market that you took there is related to a hedge that's in place. And the reason why you've said what you said is that in the future, as the hedge plays through, you will not be penalized by the 100 -- what, I forget if the number was $130 million, $140 million of mark-to-market because there's the other side of the hedge, which reverses this thing out. But the accounting rules are forcing you to take the mark-to-market in the quarter. Did I say that about right?","Ray G. Young","You're absolutely right. It's just a mismatch in terms of the treatment of the hedge relative to these underlying asset that you're hedging. You're absolutely right.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So maybe one suggestion then. Since you guys have made the effort to go and do an adjusted earnings number, I was curious almost why you didn't just take that $0.51 and then add, I think, it's $0.13 to it, which would put us at $0.64 on kind of an underlying economic rationale for the quarter itself. Would you guys, I mean -- would you generally agree that my logic is reasonable?","Ray G. Young","Yes, generally reasonable. The issue, David, is there's a lot of [indiscernible] across the board in all of our segments. And it would be difficult for us to try to highlight that on adjusted earnings for every little bit. And so what we felt will be useful was for us to highlight just the significant ones when they occur. And frankly, we're trying to figure out a means in order to mitigate this impact, so these things don't impact the results going forward. So that's what we're working on right now, David. And I mean hopefully, our finance and accounting teams will be able to find a solution and we'll be able to report back to you in the future.","Patricia A. Woertz","I think your logic though, David, is the right one. If you think about the significant timing adjustment in this quarter, you could argue that's an adjusted item. But since there are small ones in other places, we didn't put that in as part of our adjusted EPS.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I see what you're saying. So you're just being concerned about, hey, if you add that $0.13, then you should have gone through in every other segment and take into account mark-to-market gains or losses. And since that disclosure is not currently available, you don't include it in the adjusted number. But logically, the economics are what we've said.","Ray G. Young","Yes, correct. And like I said, we try to highlight the material ones in order to help you out.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I appreciate that. On the high fructose corn syrup, my last, I guess, question or 2 would just be, so the pricing comes in low-teens. That sounds good, especially in context of expanding margins. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for volumes? And I missed it if you said what sweetener volumes did in the quarter year-over-year. Did you say sweeteners volumes were up or down? I apologize I missed that.","Juan R. Luciano","We didn't say. But David, in terms of volumes, when we're finished with our negotiation, we are about -- our volumes for next year are intact. I mean, so we get the price increase. Whatever we conceded in one side, we got it on exports. So our volume in grind overall was up like 5%. But I think in sweeteners, we were flat quarter-over-quarter. So we finished, as I said before, satisfied the negotiations. We achieved our price increases. We didn't give up any volumes. So we will still have a strong demand for our wet milling portfolio.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And as regards to Mexico, so you did cite the strong export volumes which are going to Mexico. When you look forward and you think about the demand from that country -- as I understand it, right, it's a substitution effect as we're taking sugar out, putting fructose in. There's a mix issue though. It's like 100% of the sugar in the carbonated soft drinks does not come out day one. It takes years, I think, for this to occur. If I'm right about those pieces, would you agree that we should continue to see export growth in calendar '12 and '13 and probably for a number of years to come, given the relative attractiveness of high fructose versus local Mexican sugar.","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, David. Our forecast is for export to continue to be strong and continue to provide a tight balance for sweeteners, yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ian Horowitz of Topeka Capital Markets.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Ray, you commented on the CapEx going forward will be much more leaning towards your traditional lines of business. In that last wave of CapEx that we did on a large scale a few years ago, there were a couple projects beyond the PHA that weren't really kind of in that mainstream. And the one I think about the most is the propylene glycol business. We haven't heard a lot about that. I'm not sure it's anywhere near the size of what the PHA investment was. But if we could just kind of talk about that and maybe any other things that may kind of spring up as potential issues here in the future?","Juan R. Luciano","Sure. Ian, this is Juan. We're very satisfied with the propylene glycol project. We announced, I think in the past quarter, that for the first time, we have a biobased propylene glycol USP, so United States pharmacopeia grade that will increase not only the usage of that product but certainly it commands a premium price versus industrial grade. That's the one that we used to have. So we are very satisfied with that. We think that there is a big market for that. If you know propylene glycol and maybe a difference to other products, it's used in a myriad of applications and it doesn't require a lot of qualification or a lot of testing or a lot of application development because it's a liquid and you'll replace the petroleum-based liquid with a biobased liquid, one-on-one, would make it very easy the market penetration. So it's a completely different project in that sense to the PHA introduction into the market. So we are very satisfied with it and it's going and growing.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Would the product be priced at parity to the petroleum product or at premium to it?","Juan R. Luciano","That's the million dollar question, Ian. So it depends on the application and depends on the customers. I won't say more than that.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then like I said, just a quick question. On global crush capacity, we're still fairly underutilized. If we were to simply grow into the capacity from demand, what is your internal kind of forecast as when we should tighten up this overall crush supply?","Juan R. Luciano","Well, I think you can -- I can help you with the calculation. If you think that probably the industry runs at about 80-something percent, and you have a demand growing at about 4% to 6% per year, if I quote the USDA, that's how it's going to take. But I think that it's something that my teachers here have taught me in this market, is that you can have that. But every year, you have a reset with the difference in crops in the U.S. versus South America and all that. So you have a bad South American crop and all of a sudden, the U.S. gets an extra boost in demand that closes that gap significantly. So it all depends where do you have your asset base geographically distributed and what happens with the crops around the world. But again, the fundamental demand is growing at around 4% to 6% per year around the globe.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sure. I understand the different geographies. But could you assume that now going forward, that capacity shut-ins may start to slow down or the rate of them -- of you and your competitors shutting any capacity will slow down due to the fact that there's kind of that light at the end of the tunnel? That you'll kind of make it through, slog through these next couple of quarters of difficult or overcapacity, thinking that you're going to kind of grow -- the demand is going to grow into it?","Juan R. Luciano","Ian, I cannot speak for our competitors. But certainly, from our perspective, our view is we're still in the mode of adjusting capacity and taking it down or reviewing our operations on which plant we keep running or not versus adding. And I think that in general, I will imagine that the industry needs a period of recovery after this versus just investing. So I don't think anybody is out there thinking on the next plant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","In your sort of BioProducts profitability, if I look at the margin structure that was during this quarter relative to last year, it was actually higher but your profitability came in lower. Can you just talk about why the dynamics in the stock market are so different than what you guys are actually experiencing on the magnitude? I know directionally, it's kind of in the realm. But it just seems that there's something -- you would have thought it would have been a better quarter given the ethanol margin structure that we're seeing out there.","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. Ken, this is Juan. Yes, you're right. On average -- I mean, it was a probably highly volatile quarter from an ethanol margin perspective. So we climbed to very, very high margins by, I think I said, Thanksgiving. And then, it collapsed faster and steeper than what we thought. I will say, if you look at quarter-over-quarter, the biggest difference is our net corn costs are up. And that's mostly, I will say, different positioning gains versus last year.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So in the sweeteners and starches, it's the high fructose corn syrup less the starch product. But in the ethanol, it's  the ethanol minus corn prices. I thought there was a transfer pricing that was different between the 2. I thought I got it backwards. I thought your net corn costs are in your starch but maybe  on your sweeteners. Did I have that backwards?","Juan R. Luciano","No, it's in BioProducts.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then the sweeteners, it's sweeteners less the starch, not the corn, right? I thought you -- there was a transfer pricing differential between the 2 divisions. No?","Juan R. Luciano","Both take net corn costs.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I don't know why I had it in my head that there was something that was a different transfer pricing. But even as we go forward, so the other implication kind of, I think with Diane's question, is that you could actually expect negative ethanol profitability going forward until there's a supply-demand rebalancing? Is that the other implication that you were saying with Diane?","Juan R. Luciano","No. I don't recall exactly what we said. But basically, we expect -- current margins for ethanol are depressed right now. And we expect it probably -- they are depressed right now. We expect a slowly climbing out of that maybe in 2 or 3 months. And when you know -- when supply and demand balance itself either by shutting down some capacity or growing exports and growing domestic demand based on more driving mileage.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But it will it be relative -- if gross margins are roughly breakeven-ish, you would argue that your profitability in that business should be somewhat in that breakeven to up and down a little bit, but nothing even at the level that we're at right now, that they had in this current quarter. Is that fair?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. It should get better after the quarter goes by.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then my final question truly is the workforce reduction, you guys decided to cut the workforce by 3%. Part A of that is why 3%, not 5%, not 1%? Like what was the thought process behind that? And where will we and when will we see the benefit of the cost reduction? Again, I guess I use the word benefit not as a positive word. But where would you see lower cost coming into the income statement?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, Ken, first of all, we have offered a voluntary retirement program to some of our employees and we don't have the outcome of that program yet. But after that, we're looking at restructuring that allows for at least 1,000-person reduction or about 3%, which was our estimate at where we could find the benefits of further work process improvements, further efficiencies, further reporting lines and span of control improvements. And I'd say the majority of that is at the sort of SG&A kind of lines or corporate and administrative types of roles. And the \"when\" is within the next 9 to 12 months when the -- I would have said [ph] , the majority of it in the first 6 months and then the balance in the last 6 months, as we see folks -- these positions roll off the payroll and have reduced costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just quickly, I was curious if you could give a couple of remarks on the Chinese market, just 2 points there. Number one, we're hearing about some excess inventory of vegetable oil there. I was curious if you had any perspective on what that dynamic is about, and if it's getting better. And then number two, just your view on what Chinese crushing capacity is going to do this year.","Craig E. Huss","Well, crushing margins in China have not been terrific. They reflect the rest of the world to some extent. The short term -- the oil problem is, to me, it's just a short-term problem. Their demand for oil continues to be strong and I consider just a short-term issue.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then first of all, what is the short-term issue? And then secondly, if you have a view on Chinese crushing capacity.","Craig E. Huss","Well, we consider Chinese crushing capacity as the margins themselves are weak, I would say. But some were better than Europe. And as far as the oil glut that you talked about, that's just a short-term trading issue. I don't see it to be a significant overall issue.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Pat Woertz for closing remarks.","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Please, as always, feel free to follow up with Dwight if you have any further clarification or questions. We do have a note on Slide 16 that shows our upcoming webcast events. We'll be presenting at CAGNY on February 21, and also we'll be hosting a global oilseeds business review in Hamburg on March 28.

And finally, they will take your questions. Please turn to slide three.","I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. Last week we were in France welcoming our Neovia colleagues to ADM as we closed on that truly transformational acquisition for our Animal Nutrition business. This morning, we're speaking to you from our WILD Flavors facility in Heidelberg Germany. It's a state-of-the-art complex and we're excited to talk to our colleagues here about the great work they are doing to serve customers and grow our flavors and system business.","This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.88, up from $0.82 in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $860 million. The team did an excellent job to deliver stronger year-over-year profits in a volatile global environment in the quarter and completed an extremely impressive 2018 overall for ADM.","Throughout the year, we focused on executing our strategy and pulling the levers under our control. The result was a year in which we delivered: full year adjusted segment operating profit of $3.4 billion, 26% higher than 2017; adjusted EPS 44% higher year-over-year; strong operating cash flows, up more than 40%; and fourth quarter trailing ROIC of 8.3%, 200 basis points above our annual WACC.","Given those extremely strong results, earlier this morning we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.015 per share, or 4.5%. Our Q1 dividend is our 349th consecutive quarterly payment and an uninterrupted record of 87 years.","2018 was a year in which, regardless of market conditions, we continued to execute improve and grow, resulting in a range of impressive accomplishments.","In our optimize pillar, we divested our Bolivian Oilseeds business, took important steps to optimize our U.S. Origination footprint and engineered significant turnarounds in our Global Trade and South American Origination businesses. In our drive pillar, for the year we delivered cost savings of more than $300 million on a run rate basis, far outpacing our target of $200 million.","In our growth pillar, we opened, expanded, and enhanced multiple facilities around the globe, including five new and renovated ingredient manufacturing facilities and three labs and customer innovation centers. We announced Grainbridge, an important joint venture with Cargill in the digital innovation space.","We launched the SoyVen Crush joint venture in Egypt and expanded into the Russian starches and sweeteners market with our Aston joint venture. We grew our Brazilian Oilseeds Crush and value-added footprint with the Algar acquisition, and we expanded our Taste and Wellness portfolios with the acquisitions of Rodelle and Protexin.","We're also now adding citrus flavor capabilities via our acquisition of Florida Chemical Company. And of course, we just closed on our Neovia acquisition, creating a true global leader in value-added products and solutions for both production and companion animals.","We also continued to improve on our safety record in 2018; this was our 18th consecutive year of reducing recordable injuries. And December overall was our safest month ever for our employees, though some incidents at the turn of the year reinforced the importance of continued relentless focus on safety.","We made important progress in our sustainability goals, beating our own deadlines to meet our 15 by 2020 objectives for energy, greenhouse gases, water, and waste reduction. And we continued to lead the industry on the important issue of diversity and inclusion.","Together We Grow, the consortium ADM began in 2016 to focus on educating, recruiting, and retaining a more diverse workforce in the agricultural sector was recently recognized with the 2018 Innovations in Diversity Award by Profiles in Diversity Journal.","And just last week, we announced our membership in Paradigm for Parity, a global coalition of business leaders dedicated to addressing the gender gap in corporate leadership. All of these accomplishments have been supported by our accelerating Readiness efforts.","Please turn to Slide 4. One of my goals as CEO of ADM is not just to deliver good results quarter after quarter, but to enact lasting change that will allow ADM to continue improving year after year. That's what our company-wide Readiness efforts offers; a reinvention of our business from the bottom up that provides a structure for ongoing continuous improvement and gives us the tools to deliver a consistently excellent customer experience at the lowest cost.","Tools like data and analytics which under our One ADM program, we're collecting centralizing, and utilizing as a strategic asset that will help us improve our decision making. We're also conducting systematic reviews and improvements of processes around the company with an eye to simplification and standardizations that will make us more efficient and more nimble and reduce waste and defects.","Underlying and driving Readiness and critical to its long-term success is fundamental behavioral and cultural change and more effective on productive employees, which are supporting through our ADM ability to execute training or A to E. We are all in on Readiness and our efforts are accelerating.","Last year, our team identified thousands of initiatives to standardize, centralize, and digitize how we do business. By the end of the year, we had analyzed those initiatives and prioritized about 525 that, as we said last quarter, will allow us to generate more than $1 billion of run rate benefits by the end of 2020.","Today, we're proud to report that as of the end of 2018, we've already completed 120 of those initiatives which together have generated $300 million in new run rate benefits. We're also continuing to roll out our A to E training, which will help guide fundamental change in how we do our work every day. Approximately 2,000 team members have already completed today in-person training sessions.","By the end of 2019, we expect every ADM colleague to have taken the comprehensive A to E course. I'll be talking \u2013 I will be talking more later in the call about the importance of Readiness to our value creation strategy.","But now, I would like to turn the call over to Ray. ","Ray Young","Thanks, Juan.","Slide 5 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.88 up from the $0.82 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items adjusted segment operating profit was $860 million, up $67 million or 8% from the year-ago quarter.","Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC closed the year at 8.3%, 200 basis points above our 2018 annual WACC a significant improvement from the year-ago period and generating positive EVA of more than $550 million. The effective tax rate for the full year 2018 was approximately 12% and includes large favorable effects of U.S. tax reform and the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter along with certain discrete tax items netting to a favorable $74 million.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was a positive 2%, which includes a favorable true-up of the transition tax. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects a large credit due to the initial implementation of U.S. tax reform. Looking ahead, we're expecting a full year 2019 effective tax rate to be in a range of 17% to 20%.","On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of a reported quarterly earnings of $0.55 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.88 per share. The adjustments include a significant non-cash pension settlement charge related to the transfer of pension liabilities that we discussed in the third quarter earnings call.","Slide 6 provides an operating profit summary and the components for our corporate line. Other business results were a negative $14 million, but improved versus the prior year period which was impacted by significant unfavorable captive insurance underwriting performance.","Current quarter losses were driven by intercompany insurance settlement relating to sorghum shipments in early 2018 as well as some other underwriting losses and true-ups. ADM Investor Service results were up year-over-year.","For 2019, assuming no significant underwriting losses, we're expecting other business results to deliver approximately $120 million for the calendar year with results a bit stronger in the back half. In the corporate lines, net interest expense for the quarter increased due to higher short-term interest rates and new long-term debt issuances ahead of the Neovia closing.","Unallocated corporate costs of $173 million were up versus the prior year due to performance-related compensation accruals and higher project spending on information technology and growth-related projects.","Looking ahead to 2019, we're projecting some higher corporate costs as we continue to focus on and fund important projects. These projects represent investments in our future that will create shareholder value for years to come.","Therefore we're projecting net interest expense of about $100 million per quarter higher than 2018, attributable to the higher interest rate environment, and the incremental debt issued. We're expecting unallocated corporate costs in 2019 of about $170 million to $175 million per quarter, an increase over our average quarterly rate in 2018, but similar to the fourth quarter run rate due to continued strategic investments in IT, business transformation, R&D, and centralization of more activities from the business segments.","Turning to our cash flow statement on slide seven, we generated $2.7 billion from operations before working capital changes for the year, an increase of almost $0.8 billion. Total capital spending for the year was $842 million, down 20% from 2017 and in line with our target for the year. Spending on acquisitions amounted to $464 million, which includes three bolt-on additions.","For 2019, we're projecting capital spending in the range of $900 million to $1 billion, slightly below our forecasted depreciation and amortization rate with the expected increase coming from incremental spending to support our business transformation projects.","In 2018, we also returned $835 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and a small amount of share repurchase. Therefore we continued our balanced approach to capital spending, acquisitions, and return of capital to shareholders. At the end of the year, we had 566 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.","Slide eight shows the highlights of our balance sheet of -- as of December 31st for 2018 and 2017. Our balance sheet remains solid and positions us very well for 2019. Our operating working capital of $7.5 billion was up slightly versus the year-ago period. Total debt was about $8.4 billion resulting in a net debt balance of $6.4 billion.","We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 25%, down slightly from the year ago quarter. Our shareholders' equity of $19 billion was up from $18.3 billion last year, primarily due to currency translation and net earnings in excess of dividends and share repurchases. We had $8.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of the year. If you add the available cash, we had access to $10.9 billion of short-term liquidity. Our higher liquidity position at the end of 2018 also reflects prefunding to support the Neovia closing in 2019.","Next I'll discuss our business segment performances for the quarter. Please turn to slide 9. In the fourth quarter, we earned $860 million of adjusted operating profit excluding specified items, up 8% from the $793 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the full-year, our adjusted segment operating profit of $3.4 billion is 26% higher than 2017 with Origination, Oilseeds, Nutrition and Other all showing year-over-year growth in segment operating profit.","Now I'll review the performance of each segments as well as some thoughts on the first quarter of 2019. Starting on slide 10. In the fourth quarter, our Origination team performed well considering the extreme small volume of U.S. exports, soybean exports to China. Results were down versus the fourth quarter of 2017 mainly due to changes in nonrecurring items. Merchandising and Handling results were lower than the prior year period which included several significant insurance settlements in other income.","North American results benefited from weak basis gains due to strong carries as well as solid execution that drove improvements in export margins in comparable year-over-year volumes. The team did an excellent job offsetting significantly reduced exports to China by driving North American exports of corn and soybean exports to markets outside of China.","Global Trade benefit from good execution origination and continued growth of the destination marketing business as well as intercompany insurance settlement offset by timing losses in ocean freight hedges which are expected to reverse. Transportation results benefit from improved freight rates offset by increased operating costs. For the full-year, Origination adjusted operating profit of $546 million was 35% higher than 2017.","The team not only did a great job in 2018 of moving swiftly to manage changing trade flows allowing us to minimize disruptions and capitalize on new opportunities, but they also continue to grow our value-added services including destination marketing which exceeded $20 million metric tons doubling the 2014 volumes a year earlier than our goal.","Looking ahead into the first quarter of Origination, we expect positive carries in the North American Grain business and improved year-over-year results for ARTCO, partially offset by normalized margins in Global Trade. Overall, we expect first quarter 2019 Origination results to be significantly higher than the first quarter of 2018.","Now to slide 11. Oilseeds results were outstanding as the team delivered adjusted operating profits that were more than double the prior year period. Crushing and Origination results were up significantly year-over-year. Crush volumes for the quarter were among the highest ever as the business continue to leverage its global asset footprint to capitalize on solid demand for soybean meal and strong Crush margins.","South American Origination results were solid as the team did a great job managing a more conservative risk position on soybeans in a very volatile market. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other was up on strong biodiesel volumes and margins as well as higher year-over-year results from food oils, partially offset by challenging market conditions in nut processing.","Asia was higher on a strong Wilmar results. For the full year, Oilseeds operating profit was up almost 80% over 2017. The team demonstrate their capabilities by managing risk in a volatile market and by utilizing our global asset base, flex capacity and incremental expansions to set a record for crush volumes. Simultaneous they continued innovating to expand the value-added business such as finding new solutions and product streams for customers.","Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2019, we expect results to be lower than the very strong first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impacts of the biodiesel tax credit in the first quarter of 2018, first quarter 2019 results would be significantly higher year-over-year. Crushing and Origination should see continuing strong volumes and contributions from our investments in Algar, SoyVen and North American plant expansions.","We expect margins to be in line with the first quarter of 2018 when timing impacts from that quarter are taken into account. We expect good performance from RPBO though year-over-year results will be lower due to first quarter 2018 benefit of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit.","Slide 12 please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were lower than the year-ago period, despite solid overall fundamentals in the Starches and Sweetener businesses. In Starches and Sweeteners, North American volumes remained solid with comparable volumes year-over-year.","Overall results were driven by lower margins and sales in the EMEA region; higher cost in North American liquid sweeteners in part due to lower production rates at Decatur complex and lower co-product income.","Bioproducts results were lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 when trading results were very strong. Ethanol margins and volumes were down in a continued weak industry pricing and margin environment caused by continued high industry run rates and inventories.","Despite full year results for Carbohydrate Solutions being down versus 2017, the team did a great job managing through difficult conditions. The business delivered higher year-over-year volumes in the Sweeteners, showed the value of innovation and superb customer service by working with customers to form like new solution for Sweetener needs and moved quickly to increase Starch production to capitalize on margins and a growing demand environment.","With the completion of the contracting season, we can look ahead to a first quarter of 2019, in which the fundamentals for North American Starches and Sweeteners remain solid.","Overall results for Carbohydrate Solutions will be somewhat lower versus the first quarter of 2018, driven by continued pressure on European sweetener and North American ethanol industry margins and lower production rates at the Decatur complex.","On slide 13, fourth quarter Nutrition profits were down overall versus the prior year period with strong performances in WILD and Health & Wellness more than offset by weaker performance in the Animal Nutrition business, which was impacted by the production issues that compressed margins in amino acids. WFSI sales were up 14% versus the prior year quarter on a constant currency basis with the organic sales growth, up an impressive 8%.","Looking at revenue growth, WILD continue to deliver customer wins and the recent Rodelle acquisition began contributing. Health & Wellness benefit from the Protexin addition and Specialty Ingredients saw 9% year-over-year sales growth driven by proteins and lecithin.","For the full year 2018, Nutrition operating profit was up 9% versus 2017 with WFSI operating profit up more than 14%. In addition to its strategic additions, the business continue to expand its portfolio announcing further advancement in food service concepts as well as individual innovative products such as Versity yeast protein for companion animals and Onavita algal DHA powder, a new Omega-3 product solution.","We expect stronger profits for Nutrition in the first quarter of 2019 versus the first quarter of 2018, driven by sales and margin growth, operational improvements and contributions from Protexin and Rodelle and of course our just-closed Neovia addition.","In summary for the first quarter of 2019 for all of our business units combined, we expect overall segment operating profit to be significantly higher year-over-year, if you exclude the $120 million of benefits from the retroactive biodiesel tax credit recognized in the first quarter of 2018.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Juan.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 14. So we have closed on an excellent 2018 for ADM. Now we're already well into 2019 and we remain focused on pulling the levers under our control to deliver another great year.","We start with improving performance in certain businesses. Our team performed extremely well in 2018, but there were some select businesses that did not deliver against our expectations which means, there are more opportunities to improve our overall results.","We have already taken aggressive actions to help those businesses around -- turn those businesses around. For example in the midst of industry overcapacity and compressed margins, we've announced a rationalization of our peanut and tree nut origination and processing footprint.","We also made some organizational changes in that business to ensure it is structured properly to succeed among new market realities. Across the company, we've identified other businesses that we believe can do better. We have established specific year-over-year improvement targets for each of them.","We'll rigorously monitor their performance throughout the year and take further actions, if necessary to ensure that they meet our high expectations. We're anticipating $150 million to $200 million in benefits in 2019 from our efforts to improve performance.","The second area that will help deliver strong profits and returns in 2019 is Readiness. 2018 was the year in which we launched Readiness and embedded the change within the whole organization. 2019 is when Readiness accelerates as we take our current [ph] bank of 525 prioritized initiatives and deliver projects and cultural change that taken together will permanently change, how we run our business, creating a lasting structure under which we will be more efficient and more effectiveness -- effective.","Readiness will improve performance by helping us isolate problems and implement effective solutions, help to sustain our high-performing businesses and ensure we avoid pitfalls, empower us to make more effective decisions thanks to better and more timely data and analytics, allow us to anticipate and service customer needs more quickly and more effectively, and support growth efforts by improving the processes we use to identify and evaluate opportunities and enhancing the efficiency of our integration efforts.","As we mentioned earlier, we have already delivered $300 million in run rate benefits from Readiness at the end of 2018. By the end of 2019, we expect Readiness to contribute $200 million to $250 million to our bottom line.","Growth efforts are our third focus area for 2019, specifically ensuring that the growth investments we have made in recent years fully deliver on their profit and returns potential. Since 2014, we have dramatically expanded our portfolio and our geographic reach with both organic growth projects and M&A activity.","Taken together, we made more than $7 billion in growth investments over the last five years including key investment like WILD for Taste, Biopolis for Health & Wellness, Neovia for Animal Nutrition, Algar in South America and Chamtor in Western Europe as well as other bolt-on additions and organic investments.","Now with an unparalleled portfolio of products and ingredient solutions in key growth markets around the world 2019 is the year we focus on harvesting increasing returns from those investments, which we believe will deliver about $150 million in 2019. Our path to success continues to be pulling the right levers and controlling what we can control improving business performance Readiness and growth. And by focusing on these three drivers and executing well, we are well positioned to deliver continued profit and cash flow growth in 2019 and beyond.","With that, Jack please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, Eric.","Ray Young","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Larson","A couple \u2013 Juan, just a little follow-up just on your last comment on harvesting growth investments, obviously, you've got Neovia that you just closed on a few days ago et cetera. Can you give us a little bit more thoughts on Neovia? Will this be contributing immediately to earnings or is this \u2013 will it be accretive let's say in your two \u2013 how should we be thinking about the recent acquisition here?","Juan Luciano","Yes. So, we're very excited about this. I think as I said before Neovia established us as an overnight leader in the Animal Nutrition business as we combine both our businesses. The way to think about it in terms of the quantification of the impact, Eric is, if you think about my announced $150 million coming from growth initiatives, about 50% of those $150 million about $75 million belong to Nutrition. So they're going to be accrued to Nutrition. And in Nutrition, Neovia will be the largest of the acquisitions that are coming to compose those $75 million. So, with that you can get a feeling for how much will Neovia contribute and we'll start in 2019.","Eric Larson","Okay. Okay good. And then obviously you had an amazing year in Oilseeds and obviously, you've got more difficult comps going forward. But I think you also were able to build a pretty strong book I think in -- believe in the first half of this year based upon some crush margins that we saw throughout the second half of last year. Can you give us a better flavor for how you think the Oilseed division should look for the full year?","Juan Luciano","Yes sure. Listen, I think that as you said it before, probably the crush environment in 2019 will not be as spectacular as maybe 2018. But we still believe given global demand, the strength that we have around 3% outside China that this business will still maintain crush margins well above the average that we have seen over the last five years.","On top of that, I think you need to consider about all the incremental contributions that our business will get from the Brazilian acquisition Algar, the SoyVen joint venture in Egypt, and some of the expansions that we have done to our own capacity and improvements in that capacity.","On top of that, I would say you will have to add the turnaround we're planning to see in the peanut and tree nuts business in 2019. That was a little bit of an unexpected headwind in 2018. We're not planning to have the same in 2019. So, overall, I would say probably a little bit softer than 2018, but still a very solid performance by the Oilseeds in 2019.","Eric Larson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning everyone. Juan, just on the corporate expense, I mean, it's getting pretty sizable compared to the overall profitability of the business. And I'm just wondering did the centralization of it versus of allocation to the segments, I mean, what are sort of the pros and cons to doing that? Maybe I'm a little bit more focused on the cons of maybe centralizing it and not allocating it by segment doesn't sort of -- could potentially send wrong signals in terms of capital allocation investments in those businesses. So, how are you thinking about it?","Ray Young","Yes, I think -- Vincent, it\u2019s Ray here. I think one of the important initiatives on Readiness is this aspect of getting towards common global processes and standardizing our activity. So, over the course of 2018, we did centralize more of the purchasing activities, the procurement activities, right? So, we took some of the activities out of the businesses and centralized it. Same thing for marketing activities.","And so therefore, it's actually important as part of our whole Readiness initiative to actually get these groups together in order to kind of drive the standardization and the common processes. So, therefore, the -- part of the increase year-over-year is due to this type of centralization.","The other part of the increased corporate cost is what we talked about is our investments in R&D, investments in information technology, the business transformation. Even though they're spending, we do view these things like investments, right; in terms of better the company for the future. And so it's really -- those are the two main drivers in terms of year-over-year costs.","When we actually look at our core central staff cost, they\u2019ve actually gone down year-over-year, right? So, I mean, normally when people think about firm, you think about core costs and those costs are actually being driven down. So I think that we're trying to drive down that costs, take some of the savings, there's some shift in terms of some costs moving towards corporate as we centralize activities, and we're investing more frankly in terms of the innovation, R&D, and business transformation.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thank you. And just to follow-up. In the quarter in Oilseeds, were there any mark-to-market reversals?","Ray Young","The net impact on mark-to-markets in Oilseeds for the quarter was not material. So, therefore, normally we would call out if it was something above $50 million. The fact we're not calling out anything indicates that it was not a material impact for the quarter.","Vincent Andrews","But it could have been $49 million.","Ray Young","It wasn't material.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Juan Luciano","Hi, Adam.","Adam Samuelson","Hi. So I wanted to go back to some of the pieces on 2019 that you laid out make sure that I'm thinking about this properly. So I believe you called out $150 million tailwind from some of the growth investments in M&A that you've done. You talked about recovering $150 million to $200 million from some of the operational challenges at Decatur and the nut processing that you experienced in 2018. There's about an $80 million or so headwind on interest expense, if I was doing that right, $20 million, $40 million headwind on corporate. The biodiesel tax credit, if it doesn't come back, that's $120 million headwind year-on-year. And the tax rate is up a little bit.","Juan Luciano","Yes.","Adam Samuelson","And so after that which the net still modestly positive at the net income line, the question is kind of how much do you net realize on the cost savings relative to kind of broader cyclical dynamics in oilseed crush, ethanol, and Origination. Is that the right framework?","Juan Luciano","Yes. I think that's the right algorithm. So what we're thinking is you have the margins, the ups and downs of every year and then we have the things that we can control. And we laid them out and I think you repeated them very well. It's improved performance, which is $150 million to $200 million. It's the Readiness activity, which is $200 million to $250 million. We have rolled into Readiness all our previous operation and excellence activities. So we're not going to have that bucket anymore. It\u2019s part of this Readiness.","And then we're going to have the $150 million from all the accretion of growth investment that we have recently done. So you take that minus the headwinds that you described plus or minus your view of the market conditions in 2019 and that's what we consider. Still that despite maybe some modest reduction in crush margins versus the previous year, we expect that we're well positioned to grow profits in 2019.","Ray Young","Yes. And Adam don't forget then the Other segment. Okay? And this year was burdened by a lot of underwriting losses. We're assuming 2019 to be more of a normal year. So I gave guidance of $120 million in Other versus this calendar year was more like a $58 million number. So don't forget that delta as you kind of build up the model as well.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That's helpful. And then so just maybe going into some of the underlying kind of businesses' cyclical dynamics a little bit. On the crush margin side, I mean, still strong. I was just trying to make sure, I mean, where we were in 2Q and 3Q with board crush that was $1.50 plus relative to board crush that's been hovering around the $0.90 to $1 since November. I'm just trying to -- is it just Europe is better soft seed Brazil? Just help me think about the different geographies and how that plays into what you see on the board crush, which suggests a big headwind in the middle of the year.","Juan Luciano","Yes. We continue to see Adam a strong utilization in North America. We have a good book through Q1. We've seen gross margins $30 to $35 per ton in Q1. So utilization rates continue to be high.","We continue to export meal and domestic off-take continues to be robust. Actually our customers are reporting -- I mean, if you talk to the poultry customers are reporting that they believe that poultry demand has not peaked. And they see through low pricing and some of the new retail options that they're being offered right now that we're going to continue to grow per-capita consumption. So we're optimistic there.","In canola, in the U.S. margins are 25 to 45 maybe the dollars per ton for Q1, and we have profitable export oil flows there. So if you think about Europe, in Europe markets are at the carry. So customers are a little bit more hand to mouth. So maybe we don't have in Europe the same book forward than we have in North America. But mid-proteins meals seems to be in good demand from Europe itself, but also some are replacement in China. So that's supporting grape seed meal prices. So in general, margins are near $35 per ton in Europe.","If we go to South America there is a wide range in Brazil where we have some $10 to $15 per ton crush margins growth in export facilities and where we have maybe $25 to $30 per ton in gross margins in facilities that are geared toward domestic market. Maybe domestic market facilities has a little bit better ownership of beans. And we have domestic meal premiums, but also some opportunities to export meal while Argentina still got to their harvest.","Paraguay we're facing a little bit of smaller crop in Paraguay maybe 10%, 12% lower because of the drought there. So we expect to run about in the high 80s in terms of utilization there. So, maybe a little pressure there.","My understanding is that crush margins have improved recently in China for Q1. They are about something between $10 and $15 per ton. So that's kind of going around the world a little bit on the crush side.","Adam Samuelson","I really appreciate all that color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.","Juan Luciano","Okay. Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Yeah, hi, good morning.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, Ann.","Ray Young","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan","Maybe two questions, Juan. First we've kind of missed the export opportunity now for the season for U.S. soybeans to China. So could you talk about what that damage has done, what it might do and what are the structural now that at least Argentina is back producing more than it did last year?","And then secondly, we're just talking again about Argentina on the crush side. What would you anticipate they'll do? Will they export more beans? Will China pull more beans from them? Or will they export more meal which they generally do? I'm just curious what drives is there.","Juan Luciano","Yes. So, I would say regarding the U.S. exports as I think Ray mentioned in his prepared remarks, we were able -- thanks to our Global Trade group, but also our destination marketing group to offset in last Q4. Probably 70% of the volume that we were thinking China was going to take part with corn exports that grew significantly year-over-year and part by sending it to either our own Crush in Europe or other destinations maybe Thailand and other places. So that again boots on the ground in destination marketing was very helpful to move those beans around.","In our scenario planning, if you will for 2019, we are expecting at least the trade dispute with China either resolved during the year in the trade aspects, whether we continue to discuss other issues with China later on. But we think that the trade will be part of the solution during 2019. So we're still counting with maybe smaller than other years, but still sizable exports from the U.S. in Q4 from soybeans. That is our predominant scenario at this point in time. The second part of your question, sorry, Ann?","Ray Young","Argentina.","Juan Luciano","Oh, Argentina and whether we're going to export beans. So I think -- first of all, this is going to be the full season of Argentina operating without a DET. So it will be interesting to see how they behave whether they are a little bit more disciplined seller out there. I think there's still Argentina's year to sell more meal. And so I would expect that Brazil or the U.S. will take the brunt of the export of soybeans and Argentina will export the meal.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I'll live it there and get back in queue. I appreciate it.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Ann.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Heather Jones with The Vertical Group. Your line is open.","Heather Jones","Good morning.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, Heather.","Heather Jones","Thank you. I just had a follow-up question on the operational issues you guys had in 2018, specifically on Decatur and lysine. So you all talked about those issues meaningfully impacting Q4. So one wondering if that's been resolved. But the second part of that is the explosion you had earlier this calendar year like -- so when should we start to see the giveback of Decatur normalizing?","Juan Luciano","Yes. So Heather, I think you need to think about the Decatur process as a revitalization process if you will. Decatur is a plant that traditionally has been the low-cost operations for us. And so as such, we have put a lot into Decatur. It's a very integrated complex, but is also a very complex, complex if you will. And so in 2017 we have outages related to electrical infrastructure. And in 2018 we've reduced the unplanned outages because of that by 90%. So we made significant progress. Now we are -- continue to revitalize some of the equipment in the facility with planned outages this time to improve the reliability of the plant. This effort of course will yield long-term operational stability and especially at high utilization rates. That's what we try to do normally from this plant very high.","I think the issue on lysine is slightly different in which lysine we introduced a lot of new technologies in both fermentation and downstream processes, basically to improve the cost position. And we've seen already evidence of those improvements. The problem is we need a stable source of dextrose from the corn plant.","So lysine is receiving a little bit of the shocks of the planned outages that we're having in Decatur as we try to fix Decatur. So I will say you're still going to see some of that in this quarter and then they will start tapering-off and we should be completely out of all this by the second half of the year and you will see the improvement.","But the impact in 2018 was significant. It was probably in the tune of $30 million to $40 million in each of the businesses in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition and we expect that number to be significantly reduced for 2019.","Heather Jones","Okay, okay. Thank you. And then going back to your comment about soybean meal demand, you mentioned that you're expected to be -- I thought you said up 3% for the year and you mentioned China in that statement. Is that your estimate based upon where soybean meal is from a price positioning basis, but also taking into consideration the impact of ASF in China?","Juan Luciano","Yes. No my comment was 2.5% to 3% outside China, outside China. China, it's difficult to call at this point in time. I think that -- we hope that the ASF situation is getting a little bit better. We've seen the government lightening up a little bit in some of the bans in transportation of pigs -- between the provinces. So hopefully that's an indication that they see this as slightly getting better.","But as you know it takes an animal 18 20 months to get to breeding stages. So the rebuilding of the herd is going to take a while. So we expect that to drive -- in the short term to supply the demand of China to drive imports of either pork or chicken. And we think that that's going also support the demand in the other place where we produce.","So greeting the exact demand in China is going to be difficult how do they come back from Chinese New Year? I mean how much of a psychological impact all these ASF situation has had in the Chinese consumer? We will have to look at that.","Heather Jones","So just to push back on that a little bit. What is driving your lower view on the two -- on the demand outside China because 2.5% to 3% is a pretty significant slowing? So what's driving that view?","Juan Luciano","We've been close to customers and all that, and so that's kind of where the team is assuming at this point in time the demand to be.","Heather Jones","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Juan Luciano","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning.","Juan Luciano","Good morning David.","David Driscoll","Wanted to ask a little bit more about Project Readiness. I believe Juan, the goal is $1 billion in savings in two years. And I think you said on the call here that 2019 will deliver $200 million to $250 million of incremental savings for year 2019. Is that to then say that the subtraction then would be that all the balance of this shows up in 2020?","Ray Young","Yes. Just so -- so for clarification, so the $1 billion run rate by the end of 2020 is a run rate right? And as we've talked out not necessarily everything on the run rate will flow through the bottom line, because there's going to be some offsets in terms of either inflation or just reinvestment of some of the savings. What Juan indicated in terms of $200 million, $250 million savings in 2019 represents the year-over-year improvement from Readiness. So therefore, this would be additive towards the 2018 results and that reflects the combination of the run rate savings that we're going to generate this year, but also some of the run rate savings that we generate at the end of 2018 flowing through and net of inflation here. So this is a net number that we're talking about in terms of improvements in 2019 compared to 2018 from Readiness just for clarification.","David Driscoll","What's the remaining net number then after you complete 2019? So I'm getting lost here between this gross number of $1 billion and the net number that you're calling out to the bottom line. What's the residual that would be left over for 2020 and 2021?","Juan Luciano","It's probably in the range of $0.5 billion.","David Driscoll","Okay. It's still very sizable. Okay. Okay. That's very helpful.","Juan Luciano","And I think you have to say \u2013 David you have to see we have a quick start in 2018 with the $300 million, because there were a lot of ready-to-implement opportunities that actually require less capital or less changes in processes. So you can \u2013 you do more of those at the beginning. Then 2019, we'll have more foundational things that are related to processes or technologies.","And then you're going to see again an acceleration as all those projects are implemented into 2020. So I think that's a little bit the cadence. We did the easy ones at the beginning. Now we're doing the more fundamental ones that take a little bit more work and then you're going to get the benefit of all that infrastructure into 2020. That's why the $300 million, $200 million to $250 million and $500 million kind of cadence if you will.","David Driscoll","Very helpful. Last question for me is just a clarification on some of the answers you guys gave to a few other questions as it relates to China and the potential for a deal with the U.S. and China on trade. Is it \u2013 all the numbers that you've given on the call is the base assumption that we get a trade deal with the Chinese by the end of February? Is that the base assumption when you laid out all these various numbers? And then, can you give us some sensitivity of, if we don't get a trade deal what happens to your thoughts Juan on the outlook for the ADM business? How much volatility could we or should we expect, if the outcome does not occur for the base assumption?","Juan Luciano","Yes, David. So, our assumption is not that the trade deal is resolved now in the first quarter. We have it more like half of the year. So we're thinking, if there are any benefits come they will come in Origination in the last quarter of 2019. I will say, whether \u2013 the different scenarios whether we have a resolution or not, it depends on what kind of end deal we \u2013 the both \u2013 or end state both governments end up into this. If these are portrayed trade war or complete dispute, I think it's going to be bad for everybody. I think it's going to be bad for the global economy, and then it's difficult to forecast what's going to happen.","I would say in a scenario in which we continue like this which is a negotiation and with trade especially in agricultural products could be used as a token, if you will or as a contribution to \u2013 towards a bigger agreement. I think that we can handle the different scenarios. In a scenario in which we have no agreement probably beans in the U.S. are continued to be cheap. Crush margins will continue to be high, like maybe they were last year and we will have lower exports of soybeans from North America.","In a scenario in which we get an agreement and China try to buy more agricultural products from the United States, we'll probably have higher origination -- elevation margins in Q4. We'll probably have a hopefully some ethanol flowing into China that could help ethanol margins and we'll probably have a slowing down of crush in North America, or at least, a reduction in Crush margins versus 2018. So, we are in the middle of kind of those scenarios and we manage those scenarios. And I'm not saying they are neutral to us, but we can manage through both of them and see still us maintaining our forecast for 2019.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along.","Juan Luciano","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. This is more of a modeling question. But I think you guided net interest expense. Is it going to be up $200 million year-over-year, is that correct?","Ray Young","I think we indicated that we're going to be $100 million per quarter, so $400 million for the calendar year. That's what we're seeing that should be for 2019.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Am I adding the difference correctly though? I mean you had only $200 million in 2018 because I think that's the math isn't it? So, it's $200 million incrementally year-over-year of interest expense net?","Ray Young","We were higher in 2018. We're actually -- I think we're higher than that. I think we're just -- we're going to be higher, but I think it was about $40 million or something like that. But we can just follow-up with you on a one-to-one afterwards.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Maybe I'm modeling this wrong. But what I'm really trying to get at is you have higher interest expense. Does the operating income from your acquisitions offset the higher interest expense? And really -- and what does that mean for dilution in 2019?","Ray Young","No it does. It does. I mean -- and so it more than offsets in terms of the impact. So we can follow up one-on-one with you on the incremental year-over-year on a managerial basis.","Robert Moskow","Do you have an operating income number for how much the acquisition's at in 2019?","Ray Young","Well, I think Juan was talking about growth in general right? It was going to contribute about $150 million. And while that\u2026","Robert Moskow","Okay. All right. I\u2019ll go offline. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Yeah, hi. I was wondering if you guys could provide us a little bit more of an update on how high fructose corn syrup contracting is going and your expectations for 2019?","Juan Luciano","Yeah, sure Michael. Good morning. Listen, contracting is done. Of course, we started earlier the process last year and I would say we finished with volumes and margins overall consistent with last year. So we've been able to hold margins and volumes in general. Of course, there were some pickup of both year-end losses there up and down. But in general I would say consistent with 2018 for both margins and volume.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And then shifting over to Origination. Could you give us any idea in terms of how much more room there is for growth in terms of your destination marketing volumes and what the cadence might look like over the next couple of years there? And which markets you're targeting? Thanks.","Ray Young","Yes. I think the team continues to look for more opportunities. It's just, all the numbers have grown dramatically, more than doubled over the past five years. I think the rate of increase that you're going to see going forward volume-wise is going to be probably lower in terms of the rate of increase, because we've gotten to a lot of the markets that we are initially targeted.","But clearly, they're still markets. For example, in Southeast Asia, in parts of Central America, parts of Middle East that we still view, there's opportunities for further growing that business. So I would say there's still going to be growth, although, not at the same rate that we've seen in the past few years.","Michael Piken","All right. Terrific. I'll pass it on.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Ken Zaslow","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, Ken.","Ray Young","Hey, Ken.","Ken Zaslow","Two questions. One is, Juan, in the opening comments you said that you improved your Origination in the U.S. What did you do? And what was the process to which you did that?","Juan Luciano","Yes. We did several swaps and closure of elevators, just adjusting our footprint basically to where our production is and making sure that we have the right elevator tributaries to our export facilities or plants, so normal pruning and improvement of that.","But we also grew our North American fertilizer distribution business, our stevedoring business. So many, many good things have been doing, the Grain guys in the U.S., also more digital tools, better marketing, thanks to the -- even providing better marketing tools to the farmers.","But I will say, specifically to the footprint, I mean, we normally -- we have like, I mean, 200 buying stations. So normally there is some churning and I think the team was very aggressive in making sure that we shut down the ones that we needed to shut down and we move personnel to others that maybe had more volume opportunities.","Ken Zaslow","My second question, it starts out as an observation, but it'll probably lead to a question. One is, if you think about your competitors in both high-fructose corn syrup and crushing, you made two interesting observations. One is, your risk management in South America on Crushing saved you and it was successful.","And then, the last question you answered -- asked and answered was, the way that you think about your high-fructose corn syrup margins is that the pricing was actually fairly successful and that you're able to continue to do that. That is both in contrast to your competitors. So the question that I'm asking is, is there a process that you undergo that's differentiated than your competitors? And would you actually benefit from a greater sizable asset in either parts of the world?","Juan Luciano","Hard to know how our process compares to our competitor. Of course, I think one of the big advantages that I always pride ADM for having is, first of all, a great team, but also I think the fact that we keep the company relatively tight. I mean, before the acquisition of Neovia, we were a steady 1,000 people, which we handle about $60-something billion of revenue, help us to not only the agility but the sharing of information I think.","Every Monday morning we have a risk meeting, where, like, 20 or 30 people are in that goal. And I think that these are people that work very well together. They know what they do very well. And in general, you know us, we try to hedge our margins, maybe to do some basis trading.","But fundamentally, we try to leverage our asset base, because we believe the asset base of a company like ADM is irreplaceable, so we take advantage on that and that's where we make the money.","In terms of, we would like to get bigger anywhere I think that our objective is always trying to get better. And I think that as we get better we could be bigger one day. But I think that the most important thing through Readiness and everything we do is that we are very honest. And despite we have a very good 2018, we're still not satisfied. We probably left a couple of $100 million on the table on things that we should have done better and Readiness is tackling that is how do we continue to get better before we get any bigger.","So, even from a capital allocation perspective you heard us doing Neovia and we did Florida Chemicals and we may conclude that maybe another small deal that we could be negotiating here or there, but in general 2018 was a year of pausing in terms of our M&A and actually consolidate all these get our returns from all these, and again continue to think about getting better versus getting bigger. I think when we get better eventually we will get bigger, because we will be the best operators of assets out there.","Ken Zaslow","Well, you're starting to differentiate yourself. Well, well done. Thanks.","Juan Luciano","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Juan Luciano for closing remarks.","Victoria de la Huerga","Hi. It's Victoria. Thank you for joining us today.

And finally, they will take your questions.","Please turn to slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million. After working through the challenging environment in the first half of the year, we capitalized on improving operating conditions in the third quarter and are positioned well for a solid finish to the year. Ag Services results were driven by U.S. exports that surged through the quarter, creating improved merchandising opportunities as the global market relied heavily on U.S. exports of corn and soybeans. Results for Corn included strong performance in North American sweeteners and starches, growth from our international corn operations and steady results for bioproducts. Oilseeds results were impacted by significantly lower global soy crush margins, weaker origination results in Brazil and the unusual equity loss from our Wilmar investment.","WFSI results included strong growth from WILD Flavors with mixed results from our Specialty Ingredients businesses","During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic plan. We acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. In addition, we further invested in Asia's growing and evolving food demand by increasing our strategic ownership stake in Wilmar to 23%.","Our ethanol dry mill review has progressed and we are targeting receipt of final proposals from a short list of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. And, we have implemented nearly $250 million of new run-rate savings actions through the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. In line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks through the first nine months of the year.","With improving market conditions and a large U.S. harvest, combined with the team's solid execution capabilities, we feel good about the remainder of the year and a stronger 2017. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.59 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million, down $34 million, mostly on Wilmar results. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28% compared to 31% in the third quarter of the prior year.","Our tax rate is lower this quarter compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings and the tax impact of portfolio management actions taken last year and this year. Our effective tax rate this quarter is consistent with the 28% guidance for the calendar year that I provided to you at the last quarter's call. Our trailing four-quarter average ROIC of 5.8% is 80 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%.","The lower ROIC reflects the challenging operating conditions that we have experienced during the latter part of 2015 and the first half of 2016. We do expect our fourth quarter trailing ROIC to improve as we move through the end of this year.","On chart 18 in the appendix, you can the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share. For this quarter, we had impairments, restructuring and settlement charges of $0.08 per share. We had losses on sales of assets of about $0.02 per share. There was offset by about $0.09 of LIFO inventory credits.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. In the operating segments, we had some small impairments and restructuring costs and loss on disposals of assets.","As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings at Wilmar are reported by ADM on a one-quarter lag basis. The Asia loss in oilseeds reflects ADM's portion of the Wilmar loss reported in their second quarter results.","In the corporate line, net interest expense was up slightly due to interest on $1 billion of new long term debt issued this quarter, and the absence of an interest credit related to tax provisions in the prior year. Unallocated corporate costs of $106 million were down from the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower SG&A costs and lower spending on various strategic projects.","Minority interest and other include some impairment charges on certain investments and a settlement and related expenses. I'd also like to highlight that our prior year numbers included a charge of $198 million related to buying back higher cost U.S. debt and issuing lower cost euro-denominated debt.","Turning to the cash flow statement on slide 6, you can see the cash flow statement for the first nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated about $1.6 billion from operations before working capital changes during the period, slightly higher than the same period last year.","Total capital spending for the period was $621 million, down from the prior year's $819 million. Capital spending has been lower during the more challenging first half of 2016, and we do expect to finish up the year spending below $1 billion.","Acquisitions of $136 million to-date includes Harvest Innovations, Medsofts, the Moroccan corn processing operation, and Caterina Foods. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 23% level. During the current period, we spent $754 million to repurchase approximately 20 million shares.","We're heading towards repurchasing about $1 billion this calendar year. Our average share count for the period was 589 million diluted shares outstanding. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $1.3 billion for this nine-month period.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. Our operating working capital of $7.3 billion was down about $600 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.1 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $6.1 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.6 billion.","Earlier in the third quarter, we issued $1 billion of U.S. 10-year debt at a coupon of 2.5%, the lowest cost U.S. long-term debt in our portfolio. Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 25%.","Our shareholders' equity of $17.6 billion was down from the $17.9 billion level last year due primarily to shareholder capital returns in excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $6.1 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we have access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains solid.","Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance and drivers.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $650 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $684 million from last year's third quarter. As we explained last quarter, some of the challenging conditions we saw in the first half of the year began to subside late in the second quarter. This led to a more favorable environment in the third quarter. As a result, we were able to execute well and capitalize on the more favorable environment.","Adjusted segment operating profit was up about 13% versus last quarter, but down about 5% versus the year-ago quarter. It is important to note that the unusual loss related to our equity earnings of Wilmar negatively impacted us this quarter. Excluding Wilmar, our third quarter operating profits would have been up about 8% year-over-year. Following are some brief highlights; in Ag Services, we saw improving market conditions, particularly increased competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans, especially late in the quarter as we were able to export record volumes. Results for corn included continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand, production efficiencies, and improved raw material costs.","Oilseeds results were impacted by lower global soy crush margins, lower origination volumes due to the reduced Brazilian soybean and corn crop, and the Wilmar results in Asia. Excluding the startup items, WFSI operating profit was up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.","So starting on slide 9, Ag Services results benefited from record export volumes as crop shortages in South America accelerated this year's seasonal shift in global demand to North America. In addition, as the record North American harvest started in the quarter, we saw improved merchandising, warehousing, and storage opportunities, as well as improved margins.","Our global trade desk results were lower in the quarter as some commodity prices declined, causing global buyers to draw down their inventories, which limited merchandising opportunities. In Transportation, results were up due to increased utilization, strong exports, and improved freight rates. Milling and Other had another solid quarter, with results consistent with the third quarter last year on strong product margins related to seasonal demand.","Please turn to slide 10. Corn Processing results were up sequentially and year-over-year. Sweeteners and starches results improved as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand in the U.S. and Mexico, continued production efficiency, improvements, and lower raw material costs.","The company's international corn operations performed very well in the quarter. We continue to integrate our European Eaststarch operations and are tracking well on fully capturing the identified synergies. Our Olenex joint venture in Mexico also performed well in the quarter.","Bioproducts results, excluding last year's Brazilian sugar impairment charge, were essentially flat with improved operational performance and margins from animal nutrition, offset by the slightly lower ethanol results compared to last year.","Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were done in the third quarter versus a strong quarter one year ago. Crushing and origination results declined significantly versus a strong year-ago quarter due to lower soybean crushing margins as competing proteins such as DDGS and feed wheat displaced soy meal in some feed rations. We also saw some period of increased competitiveness of Argentine meal.","Oilseeds results were also impacted by weaker origination in Brazil due to the smaller soybean and corn crop which created a high cost structure in our silo and transportation network during the quarter. In addition, producer commercialization of next year's soybean and corn crop decreased due to lower commodity prices and the continued strength of the Brazilian real.","Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were up from one year ago mainly due to good performance in biodiesel and specialty fats and oils. In addition, our refined oils business continued to have strong performance supported by solid food demand and strong biodiesel volumes. Our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts business had a good quarter benefiting from the facility expansion at our plant in Dawson, Georgia. We also saw the results from the operational efficiency improvements we made in our procurement and shelling operations throughout our network.","Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined from the year ago period due to the impact of ADM's share of Wilmar's unusual loss in the second quarter. In fact, it was Wilmar's first ever quarterly loss. ADM records the share of Wilmar results on a one quarter lag basis and recorded $48 million of equity losses in the third quarter versus a $36 million gain in the third quarter of 2015.","On slide 12, please. WFSI results were up slightly compared to the third quarter last year. We saw strong operating profit growth for WILD Flavors and good performance from Eatem Foods, offset by mixed results from our Specialty Ingredients business. In protein, we saw strong overall demand led by functional concentrate and textured concentrate. Results for the quarter included operational start-up costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande.","Also in the quarter, we again added to our capabilities with the acquisition of Caterina Foods, a leading toll manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. Having the Caterina business helped us as we continue building our portfolio to meet the needs of health-conscious consumers.","WILD Flavors saw an 8% increase in revenue with a 20% increase in operating profit. However, the challenges we have highlighted in recent quarters with some of our Specialty Ingredients business, SCI, edible beans and hydrocolloids have continued. Our fibers business has been subject to industry oversupply issues that have kept pricing down. Partially offsetting these negatives, we have seen \u2013 has been some strength in our specialty proteins business in the quarter.","Our SCI business has experienced some operational issues that have resulted in inventory write downs and some lost sales over the past year. We are addressing these issues aggressively. As we continue to work with customers and other businesses within ADM, we've recognized that we can be more effective at meeting customer needs and driving performance by aligning in SCI's businesses into other areas of the company. We believe that we can more easily achieve synergies and improve top-line sales under a new organizational structure. I have teams working through those details right now.","Now on slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we continue to strengthen and grow our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few. We recently expanded and streamlined operations at our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts crush facility in Dawson, Georgia, and we're already seeing the results of this operational efficiency improvements.","We have progressed our ethanol dry mill review. We are targeting receipt of final proposals from a short list of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. We have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the end of the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.","During the third quarter, we completed the successful deployment and go-live of our 1ADM business transformation with our Ag Services U.S. elevator system covering more than 200 locations. Our 1ADM program is our multiyear global investment that will help the company improve and standardize our business processes and deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness on our activities.","I am proud that this significant deployment was delivered on time and under budget, and with quality levels of execution, providing us confidence as we move to the next phases of the 1ADM program.","We also during the quarter acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty, gluten-free, and high-protein pastas to continue meeting the needs of health-conscious consumers. And our Stratas Foods joint venture recently acquired Supreme Oil, a U.S.-based manufacturer and distributor of edible oils and related products. Stratas Foods is our joint venture with ACH Food Companies and is North America's leading supplier of fats and oils to the food service, food ingredients and retail private label markets.","Adding Supreme Oil provides the JV with manufacturing locations in Tennessee, Alabama and New Jersey. The Northeast presence is important and is one of the largest consumption areas for edible oils and one where Stratas lacks presence. This acquisition provides Stratas with entry into the growing seasonings, sauces and condiments category, and its products and operations offer good opportunities for both cost and revenue synergies.","These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter.","And now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated last quarter, the first half of the year presented some challenging conditions. However, we are seeing an improving operating environment in the second half of the year that we believe sets the stage for a stronger 2017.","For Ag Services, the North American harvest is progressing well and we're seeing record yields and production for both corn and soybeans. We expect this to translate into continued solid results for export volumes and better global merchandising and handling opportunities as we finish out the year.","Export origination margins while good and improved versus last year, are not at the same levels we realized in 2014. For corn, while fourth quarter volumes are expected to be down due to normal seasonality, we are optimistic in 2017 for our sweeteners and starches business with global sugar prices up significantly year-over-year and the ongoing progress of our operational excellence initiatives.","Ethanol margins are currently being supported by strong domestic and export demand. As in the past, margins will be a function of the supply-demand balance and the impact of net inventory levels. As I mentioned earlier, we have made progress with our ethanol dry mill review. We have seven original parties express interest and we have now narrowed that list to a smaller number. We are having these parties undertake some additional due diligence prior to them submitting final proposals, which we are targeting for the end of the calendar year.","For Oilseeds, with ample soybeans from the record U.S. harvest along with solid domestic demand, crushing volumes are expected to be seasonally high in the coming months. Crush margins could experience some short term resistance from competing global proteins. South America grain origination margin will be depending on new crop volumes. At present, new crop origination volumes are slow and behind plan. However, we do anticipate ultimately procuring the crop.","The fundamentals of increased global protein consumption point to a long term sustainable trend which supports higher soy meal demand and higher industry capacity utilization into the future. For WFSI, the fourth quarter is traditionally our low volume quarter as WILD Flavors experiences some typical seasonality from the beverage industry. We expect continuous strong results from protein in the fourth quarter. We will incur continuous start-up costs for our Tianjin and Campo Grande plants as they begin their first phases of production late in the quarter.","So with that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Research. Your line is open.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. This is Cornell in with a few for David.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Cornell.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hi, Cornell.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just wanted to start off. I mean, there are a lot of negative headlines, I guess, in the third quarter early surrounding kind of the poor environment in South America. But things seemed to have turned out a bit better than perhaps you're expecting. Did the environment change drastically perhaps in the last month of the quarter such that a strong September provided boost to 3Q numbers relative to how things were looking previously?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, Cornell. This is Juan. Yeah. I think your assessment is correct. I think that the quarter got increasingly stronger August and September, especially in the Ag Services, and I will say in sweeteners and starches as well. So those \u2013 but increasingly, in terms of export from the U.S. in August and September. Those were very strong months.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then one last quick one is just what's the anticipated effect? I think you're started to touch on it a bit, of the large U.S. harvest on the business going forward. So, specifically, as you look at each segment, can you explain what record U.S. crop production and record U.S. exports will ultimately mean over the coming quarters?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. Of course, we're going to have better volumes and better margins in Ag Services. We are seeing probably an export window all the way to extending not only in Q4, but also into Q1 for North America. And we have very good ownership. So we have the pipeline filled. We think that we're going to have strong crush margins in the Q4. And the demand particularly in sweeteners and starches and ethanol continues to be solid, and we're going to have the product to supply that demand. So we feel very strongly about the following quarters.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Tom Simonitsch on behalf of Ann. Just one question on China. How do you expect China's current trade policies to impact each of your businesses in the balance of 2016 and into next year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you for the question. Obviously, we are starting that and you've seen many changes in China recently, not only the change in the way they handle their reserves or internal subsidies, but also some import duties for DDGS. So it certainly will impact some of the exports in that \u2013 in \u2013 whether it's barley, whether it's corn, whether it's DDG as they reduce their inventories. But demand continues to be very strong, so we still believe in very strong imports of soybeans from that perspective. But we're watching the corn and the sorghum and the DDGS export that has been reduced.","Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And in terms of U.S. ethanol exports as well, I think, you mentioned last quarter that you're expecting 850 million to 900 million gallons with China absent from that market. Is that expectation still intact?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, it is. We've seen several destinations. I think the world market is consuming a lot of gasoline and certainly ethanol is a very good octane enhancer oxygenate and as you think about some countries trying to reduce pollution created by automotive usage, we think that ethanol continues to be a very strong product for export. We've been exporting very heavily to Canada. We've been exporting much more than last year to Brazil. China has been there, but we also have new destination showing up. So we feel strong about export will grow into next year.","Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning, could you discuss the outlook for pricing in your sweeteners and starches business? We've pretty tight capacity utilization rates, elevated sugar prices, but do lower corn cost impact your ability to get pricing through in any way?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Listen, we have already concluded this year's negotiation for 2017 liquid sweeteners contracts. And we are very satisfied the way things are evolving into this industry. As you describe, volumes have been strong and the industry has been very tight. Contracting season did start earlier than normal this year and so that's normally a good sign for us for expanded margins. So, I will say in terms of specifics, we will try to stay to our traditional timeline to discussing this outlook although we have finished some contract negotiations as our portfolio continues to broaden, there are other product lines that we're still wrapping up those negotiations. So I'd rather address the more specifics to this in the next quarter's call. I would just say at this point in time, we are optimistic about that. It has been a positive negotiation so far.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. You mentioned the increased competitiveness of Argentine meal in world markets. Is any of this related to increased sales following the confirmation that subsequent cut to the soy export tax would be delayed until 2018, and how do you see this dynamic evolving going forward particularly if growers are incentivized to increase plantings of corn and wheat at the expense of soy?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. So, many aspects to your question. Certainly, there was some discussion about the ability of the government to continue to reduce these export taxes in Argentina. The government finally announced that it would not have the ability to honor that promise. But they also created some reductions for some provinces in the north to kind of balance the people that are farther away from the ports.","So I will say this is going to be a fluid situation as you describe the intentions of the farmers has been to shift to corn some acreage in Argentina, but early planting conditions there may be making a little bit more difficult to that and some people have started to plant some soybean. So, I think, it's a fluid situation. And for the time being, we're going to expect North America to be the competitive sourcing of soybean meal in the world, so \u2013 until we have the next South America crop.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hello, Adam. Are you on mute?","Operator","Adam Samuelson, your line is open.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Okay. Kelly, maybe we'll go to the next question.","Operator","Sure. Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam of Stephens. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Farha.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","First question is on refining, packaging and biodiesel, your results were quite strong in the current quarter. Is there anything in particular that was one-time in nature or how should we think about that going forward?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No. I think, the team has been \u2013 have done a terrific job of \u2013 especially in Europe, of improving some of our specialty fat and oil business, and maybe didn't quite perform last year, and they made some modifications to that. So you have an improvement. But I will not call it a one-off, it's an improvement versus last year on good performance. And overall, we saw strong demand for oil and a strong volume for biodiesel, and that drove the better performance. But there's nothing unusual in those results.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","So we can model that going forward. Is this sort of a new sustainable run rate?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think you should see. I mean, obviously, it would depend on biodiesel. You know biodiesel is rather volatile, so. But I think the other businesses, refined oil, bottled oil and specialty fats, and I think those businesses you should expect this kind of performance going forward.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then longer term, if we look at ADM as a company, how should we think about the earnings algorithm for ADM, and how would the divestiture of the ethanol assets kind of impact that long term earnings algorithm?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. So let's talk a little bit about that. We said before that we would expect in this strategy that we put together a couple of years ago to give us over the next three years $1 to $1.50. And we continue to be committed to that and expecting those results. At the same time, we saw our base being impacted by some of the headwinds going down from maybe a $3 level to maybe a $2.40 level.","Obviously, we're coming back from that as you can see in this quarter and as you're going to see in Q4 and hopefully with a stronger 2017. It's still difficult to quantify given that we have only one quarter of that, how much of that base deterioration are we going to recover. With regards to the ethanol dry mills, as you heard me saying in the prepared remarks, we are waiting for the second round of bids before the end of the year.","And at that point in time, Farha, we will sit down and assess the offers that we have in front of us, and we will make a decision based on that. So I think it's a little bit premature to speculate on how the dry mills should factor in our next year's earnings.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. This is helpful. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Farha.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I will actually stick to one question, how is that? On the high level side, when you think of 2017, is there anything in the operating environment that you would consider abnormal that we'd not be able to start to get the typical type of results that you would expect from your company, given the improvement in the operating environment as well as the cost efficiencies and all the stuff you've done. So is 2017 kind of a critical year to show all your progress? Is there anything that would limit you from being able to do that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Ken, I think that that's kind of the way we're thinking about it. We think that 2017 should provide an opportunity for us in a more normalized environment to demonstrate all the earnings power that we've made through the cost improvements or through all the investment. There are risks as we face every year.","Obviously, you have the potential China grain reserve significant release and how they managed that and how many years do they want to achieve that that could be a risk. Obviously, ethanol, the way producers will manage supply, demand and inventories is another one.","But I think in general, we feel strongly about everything that we have done over the last few years to improve our company and position our company to take advantage of this market condition. So we feel good about 2017.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Connor - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. This is actually Robert Connor, on for Rob Moskow. So, it looks like your soy crush margins have been weak globally, but you kind of expected that to improve. Could you just maybe expand a little bit upon why they've been so weak and then what are kind of the forces that are going to improve margins?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I would say from our perspective. First of all, you were comparing with a very strong quarter last year. So if you look at the underperformance of oilseeds, 60% of that is explained by the Wilmar, which is a very unusual result.","So when you look at the performance of oilseeds per se, we have origination inside oilseeds for Brazil, and the farmer in Brazil that was 40% sold by this time last year is only 20% sold now. So we had less volume going through our operations.","And if you think about the crush margins in the U.S., we didn't have some of the pressure that exports of mill have brought maybe last year to the U.S. So, obviously, with the big run-up in mill prices by mid of the year, by June or something like that, other things became more competitive, whether it's a low-quality feed wheat or whether it is DDGs or corn got a little bit into the Russian.","So we think that demand is very strong. Still, we're thinking about 5% mill consumption growth for next year. And we believe that the U.S. will have high crush margins, and we feel good about the potential expansion of that crush in margin. It just could be a little bit attenuated by the fact that we need to fight with some substitution maybe over the next quarter. But we feel good in general about oilseeds.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. In the last week or so, we've seen the basis on soy work very favorably toward you guys or toward the processors. A lot of supply out there, thank goodness we have a lot of exports or we would be swimming in grain. But can you talk a little bit about sort of the near term impact of that and then the elevation margins that you're seeing. And we're seeing some transportation issues on the Mississippi. Can you kind of pull all of that together? It looks like storage is also pretty full. So it looks like the near term environment for your crush margins could be quite strong if export demand stays as strong as it is.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Eric. Let's take your questions on part. There is a big crop coming and certainly the pipeline and the storage is becoming fuller and fuller. So you see that reflection a little bit in the basis. So that is good for ADM, we have good ownership obviously. In terms of the exports, we said before that 2014 was an unusual year because with all the fracking that was basically taking a big part of the rail system in the U.S., there was a little bit of a glut going into the New Orleans area.","This year, although maybe you were reflecting on some recent issues with transportation, in general, if you compare to 2014, rail velocity has been so much better. Freights have been lowered. So in general, we didn't get to the same level of elevation margins that we got in 2014. So volumes are good, volumes continue to be very, very strong into Q4. And margins are okay, they are not just the record then maybe it used to be in 2014. I don't know, Ray, if anything that you will like to add to this?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No. I mean, I think the elevation margins clearly did improve as we kind of went through the third quarter, so that's been very, very encouraging. Again, as Juan indicated, I don't expect it to get back to 2014 levels which really resulted in ag services operating profit, some very, very strong results. But we are going to have good results in the fourth quarter. There's no doubt about it.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Stuart Henry - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's Mike Henry in for Mike Piken. Quick just a question, I was wondering if you guys could talk about any potential cost savings plan in 2017, any potential magnitude on that and what areas or what bucket that could potentially fall into?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, Mike. I mean, clearly, we've been on a multiyear plan in terms of driving operational excellence within the company. We set a target of $275 million this year which we'll exceed, we haven't set our targets for next year, but you should expect us to actually continue to have some good targets in terms of the operational excellence because clearly there's still more opportunities to be had.","One thing I do want to point out, as Juan indicated, we talked about the 1ADM program, whereby we're actually implementing this business transformation program within the company. It does cost money. For example, this year on 1ADM, we're spending about $100 million. As part of that project, some of it is capital, some of it is operating expenses, this program is ramping up, so therefore I do expect next year our spending will increase as we ramp up this program. We'll provide more context in the fourth quarter call because we're still working through what the actual spend will be. But what we're doing is we're actually taking some of these cost savings that we've had and we're going to reinvest in the company. And so, we're going to reinvest in terms of whether it be business process improvements or we're going to be reinvest in R&D and innovation as well.","So, again, we'll give more context to this when we get to the fourth quarter call, but I'm very pleased that these savings are coming, but we are going to reinvest some of these savings in order to make this company stronger for the future.","Michael Stuart Henry - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Sorry about that. Multiple calls going on at once, maybe a question on ag services for the fourth quarter, and this has been touched on in some respects. But I'm wondering, I mean, we all see North American export environment is very strong. We've got a record crop. At this point, we're a month into the quarter. Can you help us frame kind of the range of outcomes that you could think of for ag services in the current environment and what would be drivers to the upside and towards the lower end of that range? Thanks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. Thank you, Adam. Listen, I think we will continue to see strong exports. We see that, in that sense, Q4 should be stronger. We expect higher utilization of our storage and transportation assets. Although maybe freight rates may be pressured a little bit due to higher transportation equipment availability I think I addressed that when I addressed Eric's question before. But in general, we will continue to see a stronger ag services performance as we finish the year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And does that relate into the first part of 2017, is it really just as visibility to the South American crop increases, is that that drives the variability in the outcomes for ag services, or anything else there that you're mindful of into the first half?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. So to give you some perspective, so we're expecting 2016 to end between 2014 and 2015; obviously, higher than 2015 and not as high as 2014, but I think that when you think about 2017, we expect some of this export to overspill into Q1. So the window obviously will depend a lot on what happened in South America. There are still three months of weather ahead of us. But we still believe that the U.S. will be very full in the pipeline and will be exporting corn and soybeans well into Q1 next year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Case McGee, Vice President, Investor Relations, for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. McGee, you may begin.","Case McGee","Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's first quarter earnings conference call. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's call will be available at adm.com.","For those following the presentation today, please turn to Slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results.","These statements are based on many assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation, and you should carefully review the assumptions and factors in our SEC reports.","To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.","On today's call, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Woertz, will provide an overview of the quarter; our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Juan Luciano, will review the drivers of our operations' performance in the first quarter, provide an update on actions to improve returns and discuss factors that could influence future performance. Then they will take your questions.","Please now turn to Slide 3. I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, thank you, Case, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter conference call. This morning, we reported first quarter net earnings of $267 million or $0.40 per share on a diluted basis. Our adjusted EPS was $0.55 per share. Segment operating profit was $691 million.","Our businesses delivered mixed results this first quarter. Our Ag Services business again generated weak results due to a low-margin environment, as well as logistics and weather challenges that we saw in the United States. Continued strong performance in Corn was supported by the robust ethanol markets, and the sustained solid results in Oilseeds were driven by good margins and volumes in North and South American soybean crushing.","We also continued to make very good progress during the quarter in our ongoing portfolio management and our other key initiatives to improve the earnings power and returns of the company.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.55 compared to $0.46 last year. Excluding the specified items in adjusted EPS, and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $780 million, up $111 million or nearly 17% from last year.","To help investors analyze the underlying earnings trends, we will be highlighting, in the next chart, the mark-to-market timing effects that were significant this quarter.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27% compared to 28% in the first quarter of the prior year.","Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.9% improved from the 6.6% at the end of the fourth quarter and also significantly improved by 140 basis points from the 5.5% at the end of the first quarter last year.","This year, we're introducing the annual WACC concept that we'll be using to establish a WACC for calendar year planning reflective of a single-A target capital structure and the interest rate environment at the beginning of the year. The 2014 annual WACC is 6.4%. Our long-term WACC is 8.0% and is reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.","In addition, we have introduced economic value added to our key metrics. In the first quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average EVA was $134 million based upon adjusted earnings and the annual WACC.","On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.40 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.55 per share. For this quarter, LIFO was the only adjustment to adjusted EPS, a $159 million pretax charge as commodity prices increased through the quarter.","We also noted in the appendix the net timing effects for the quarter, primarily related to ethanol and cocoa. In total, the net timing effects for this first quarter were about $0.09 per share negative. In the absence of these net timing effects, the adjusted EPS for this first quarter would have been $0.64 per share.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. I would like to highlight some unique or specified items in the operating results. Juan's discussions of operating results will exclude the specified items and the net timing effects so that you can understand the underlying trends in the business.","In the Oilseeds segment, mark-to-market timing effects in cocoa resulted in charges of approximately $24 million for the quarter or $0.03 per share versus a gain of about $5 million in the same quarter last year.","We were expecting some significant negative mark-to-market timing effects related to our canola hedging program as we locked in forward margins in a rising margin environment, which I previewed at an industry conference at the end of February.","However, in March, the forward canola margins came down, and our mark-to-market impact was significantly reduced by March 31 such that the amount of the net effect was consistent with the ranges in a more normal quarter.","In the Corn segment, we are separating out, again, our net timing effects. In this first quarter, we had a combination of hedge ineffective of gains and mark-to-market losses on our ethanol hedging program. The net impact was a loss of $65 million in timing effects or $0.06 per share, which we expect to recover in the second and third quarters.","In the Ag Services segment, included in results was a gain of about $20 million related to a partial reversal of a loss provision that we settled in the quarter. We had previously set up and disclosed this loss provision in the second quarter of calendar year 2012.","Now let me also touch on a few items of significance in the corporate line. In the fourth quarter, interest expense was slower due to lower borrowings, unallocated corporate costs were slightly down, and in the first quarter of 2013, we had some other charges related to the initial FCPA provision.","Turning to cash flow statement on Slide 6. We present here the cash flow statement for the quarter ending March 31, 2014, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $0.2 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $0.4 billion last year.","Working capital changes were a use of $0.6 billion of cash in the period compared to last year, when they were minimal.","Total capital spending for the first quarter was $188 million, which was lower than our 2013 spend of $248 million. After changes in working capital and investments, our free cash flow for the first quarter was negative $546 million compared to positive $93 million last year.","In February, our $1.15 billion convertible debt matured and we paid down this debt, contributing to our overall debt reduction for the quarter.","In the first quarter, we spent $175 million in share repurchases, as we repurchased about 4.3 million shares. And we increased our common dividend rate by 26% in the first quarter. And with $158 million we paid in common dividends, we returned $333 million of capital to shareholders and are on track to return to shareholders the $1.4 billion that we indicated in our 2014 capital plan.","We finished out the quarter with an average of 663 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31 for both 2014 and 2013. Cash on hand was approximately $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year. Our operating working capital of $11.6 billion was down $2 billion from the year-ago period. Of this reduction, about $1 billion was related to lower inventory prices and about $800 million was related to lower trade receivables, due in part to the international securitization program.","Total debt was about $5.7 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $4.1 billion, down significantly from the 2013 level of $7.2 billion.","Our shareholders' equity balance of $20.1 billion is slightly over $1 billion higher than the level last year. Our ratio of net debt-to-total capital, that is assumed cash from gross debt, is 17%, much lower than the March 31, 2013, level of 28%.","We had $6.6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of March, as we reduced our revolving credit facilities in December 2013 by $2 billion due to the strength of our balance sheet and the lack of need due to the GrainCorp acquisition not moving forward. If you add the available cash, we had access to slightly over $8 billion of liquidity at the end of March. Clearly, we have a lot of financial flexibility related to our balance sheet.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Thanks, Ray, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. I'll start with segment operating profits and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments.","In the first quarter, our underlying segment operating profit was up by 17% year-over-year but down sequentially. During the quarter, we advanced our work to improve the performance of the business through cost-reduction efforts, through portfolio management and through growth efforts. I'll provide more detail on those in a bit.","As Pat mentioned, segment results were mixed. Generally, Oilseeds was consistent with our expectations, Corn was better than we expected, and Ag Services was weaker than we expected.","I'll walk through the results now starting on Slide 9 with the Oilseeds team, who performed well this quarter. In North America, strong export and domestic demand drove good soybean crushing capacity utilization and margins. In South America, we also ran hard with good margins, crushing ample supplies to serve solid demand. We also exported a large South American harvest without a repeat of the logistical issues that affected the industry last season.","In Europe, solid demand for both oil and meal translated to good performance in the region.","Cocoa results recovered as the work by the team to improve performance continued to pay off and the margin environment continued to improve. I'll talk later about our plans to sell our chocolate business.","Please turn to Slide 10. The Corn Processing segment delivered another strong quarter. In our ethanol business, logistical challenges and weather conditions kept some industry production offline. At the same time, economics drove strong export demand. These combined to create a steady rise in prices and margins through the quarter. We worked every logistical angle and ran our plants hard, delivering large volumes amid record industry margins. We also took advantage of the very favorable forward pricing environment and locked in good ethanol margins. Overall, a really strong performance here.","In sweeteners and starches, volumes in the quarter were down slightly but better than we expected, driven by exports, primarily to Mexico.","Slide 11, please. In the first quarter, Ag Services delivered a weak performance overall. In U.S. merchandising and handling, we exported steady volumes year-over-year. But the inverted corn, soybean and wheat markets limited our merchandising and storage opportunities. And for the volumes we did move, our margins were hit by higher logistics costs due to rail delays and weather problems.","Unfortunately, this all occurred at the end of the U.S. grain export season. So while transportation conditions should improve in the coming months, overall, U.S. export volumes will see their seasonal decline as the world looks to South America for soybeans.","In international merchandising, we saw the initial results of our actions to improve the Toepfer business, and performance improved sequentially. We also announced plans to acquire the remainder of Toepfer, which I'll discuss in a moment.","In milling, feed and grain merchandising opportunities were limited by the absence of the seasonal carry that normally exists in the weak market.","In transportation, the harsh weather hindered river traffic and limited barge tow sizes. That constrained our ability to move barges early in the quarter, but it also created pent-up demand for barge freight. And once river traffic returned in March, we were prepared to handle large volumes at good rates.","Now on Slide 12. We wanted to briefly update you on our recent progress towards improving the returns of the company. We focused those efforts in a few areas: strengthening the business, managing our portfolio and growing the business.","In the area of strengthening the business, we have set the goal of achieving $200 million in ongoing cost savings by the end of 2014. I'm pleased to note that our team has met that goal ahead of schedule. We continue to look for more savings, and we're setting new targets, which we'll share with you soon.","In the area of managing our portfolio, earlier this month, we announced an agreement to sell our South American fertilizer business to Mosaic, a move that will allow us to profitably exit a business that has not been meeting our return objectives.","We also announced that we have engaged advisors to facilitate the sale of our chocolate business. We plan to retain the majority of our cocoa press business, a business we have taken actions to improve and for which we see a promising outlook.","Also, in April, we announced an agreement to acquire the remainder of Toepfer. This will allow us to continue our efforts to strengthen this business and fully integrate it into ADM's global origination network. Each of these actions improves our ability to deliver returns and better aligns the company for the future.","Our efforts to improve returns also involve investing to grow the business. During the first quarter, we announced plans to construct a $0.25 billion specialty protein plant in Brazil. That plant will serve the region's growing demand for protein with high-value plant-based protein ingredients our customers use in a range of foods.","We also announced an investment in Rennovia, a privately held firm with a complementary portfolio of low-cost, high-yield catalysts and processes for making chemicals from renewable feedstocks. This investment is part of our ongoing effort to strengthen our Corn business by creating a fight for the grind.","These are among the many steps we're taking to strengthen the organization and prepare it for a future of ever stronger returns.","And finally, on Slide 13, we wanted to discuss some of the factors we think will influence our business in the coming quarters.","In Oilseeds, global protein demand continues to be strong. The seasonal shift from North to South American soybean supply is underway, and the South American harvest is large. And we continue to see strong demand for our growing portfolio of high-value specialty food ingredients.","In Corn, we continue to see good ethanol demand translating into healthy margins. And the full effect of 2014 pricing will challenge profitability in the sweetener business.","And in Ag Services, there is a lack of significant carries in the corn and wheat markets, and we believe it's likely to continue. U.S. farmers are planting what could be a large harvest, which could reset the margin environment. With the improvement of weather, we expect to see transportation issues to continue to improve, and we expect to see the seasonal volume increase in our wheat milling business. Pat?","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Juan. So in summary, the challenges presented by the U.S. grains environment notwithstanding, corn and oilseeds look good. Very good work by the team on strengthening the business, whether it be cost, cash or capital discipline, managing of the portfolio and in investing to grow.","So longer term, I believe this work will lead to improved returns and value creation for shareholders.","So with that, operator, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Driscoll from Citi Research.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'd like to start off on the ethanol. I think the $154 million number excludes the hedge timing effect yet seems to translate into profitability of something like $0.35 a gallon. Historically, this would be a good number, but with spot margins that were well over $1, can you kind of just discuss how the quarter played out and what the implications are for the ethanol margins going forward in second and third quarters?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, David, this is Juan. Obviously, as we saw opportunities and better margins than we expected, we were booking some forward margins. So maybe what you see in the first quarter is also a combination of part of the businesses that we have booked before. Also, don't forget that our bioproducts is a combination of several products inside that portfolio, not only ethanol. So you describe it correctly. We saw -- we see a strong environment for margins into the business. In Q1, we not only booked margins for Q1, but also booked some for Q2, which bodes well, again, into the future. So all in all, we see ethanol margin with optimism for the rest of the year.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. On Oilseeds, can you just explain the sequential weakness in profits? You guys describe the business as doing very well, but when you look at the fourth quarter numbers relative to the first quarter numbers, there's a significant sequential slowdown in profitability. And I always think that the Northern Hemisphere drives 4Q and 1Q in that they're pretty reasonable to put those 2 quarters together. Would like to understand that and just a little bit more of, Ray, is there any mark-to-market at all? I mean, I think you said canola was not, so was there anything here to suggest that there is a timing issue, that the profitability gets better in the business going forward?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, David, I'll start and then I'll pass it to Ray to answer the second part of the question. Three things that made the difference between Q4 and Q1. One is the biodiesel. With the expiration of the credit, certainly it was not that strong as it was in Q4. Second, we had some weather issues, and that impacted some of the canola operations. And third, we have lower Wilmar results this quarter than the previous quarter.","Ray G. Young","And David, on your question whether there were any mark-to-market impacts, as I indicated, we thought we were going to have a fairly sizable canola mark-to-market impact. And as we kind of went through the month of March and we closed March, we still had a negative mark-to-market impact on canola, although the size of that mark-to-market impact was consistent with our normal ranges. And again, you asked me about our normal ranges, I mean, we could see plus or minus $20 million to $30 million mark-to-market impacts on canola, and that's a normal quarter. I mean, that's because of our mark-to-market accounting on canola. So I guess what I can say is we did have a negative mark-to-market on canola. We didn't think it was outside of our normal range. That's the reason why we didn't highlight it as one of the items on our timing effects chart in our press release and in our earnings deck.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I could sneak one last one in. Can you give us any comments on what the potential is for the integration of Toepfer into the operations in terms of any kind of synergies? I've always thought that there was potentially a large number here, but any dimensionalization of this that you could give us would be helpful.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, David, I think when we were having it before, obviously, we owned 80% before, it was easy to align the company, but we couldn't have a full integration. Now we think that, that's going to be fully realized, so there are some cost synergies, certainly. But also, more importantly, probably, we're going to have a full value chain all the way from origination to destination markets when we include Toepfer origination and destination units into our Ag Services business. So I think this is going to serve to strengthening our Ag Services business. We are treating this internally as an acquisition, so we have a very disciplined implementation plan and integration. And as we get more comfortable into realizing some of those, maybe we will disclose some of those numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Tiberio from Miller Tabak and Company.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Juan, I guess, over the last year or so, you've kind of framed Ag Services that if we get a large corn crop within North America that there was the potential for Ag Services to get back to normalized historical levels. Based on some of your initial commentary, it sounds like that may not be the case. And correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe you can just frame it up for us. Excluding the weather and logistics issues, do we need another large North American corn crop until we can actually start getting back to historical levels in Ag Services again?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Tim, I would say yes. I think we need -- we still need another strong corn crop for the pipeline to be refilled and for us to have the full potential of the Ag Services earnings. When we think about Ag Services, part of our income comes from acquiring cheap bases at the harvest, and that didn't happen this year. But part also -- part of the income comes from wheat carries, and we didn't have that either. So when you have all these inverses and you don't have the break of the bases, I think it presents a difficult environment. When we look at -- and we look very deeply at the Ag Services, none of the KPIs are indicating any deterioration in our position. We export more than last year the volumes that we handled, so we feel comfortable. Our operation costs are under control or better than last year and our volumes are on check, so it's just a matter of we haven't been presented with the opportunities. And we believe that, that will happen in the second half of this year.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just moving back to Oilseeds. Looking out into the second half, what is your confidence level for protein demand out of the Far East? We're obviously seeing pretty weak Chinese crush margins. I think there's been some questions around the sustainability of feed demand within China as the hog herds have improved and still some of the issues on the poultry side. Are you still as confident in the second half for Far East protein demand as you were a quarter ago?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. I would say, in general, demand for feed in China, with these up-and-downs, continue to be very solid. I would say the fundamental trend is still there. You're going to see adjustments as they are overshoot in one direction or the other, but I would say, medium term, second half, I still consider it very, very solid.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question on kind of your increased focus on value-added products, health and wellness. Are there any critical pivot points or milestones that we should be aware of over the next 6 to 12 months in how you're thinking about accelerating that business?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, this is a business that quietly has been growing inside ADM and inside the Oilseeds business. And obviously, with some of the trends in terms of people wanting to add more protein and fiber into their diet, that kind of accelerated. And it's increasingly becoming a more important contributor of earnings for the business and also a very solid type of earnings, earnings that don't have that much volatility quarter-to-quarter. So you will see us trying to grow that business organically and maybe through acquisitions over time. We need to continue to expand our product mix. We need more capabilities. So you will see us very active in that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on Oilseed. And again, kind of a follow-up to David Driscoll's question, I mean, if we just look strictly at what you guys reported in oilseed crushing as opposed to excluding Asia and biodiesel, it still seems like the results maybe should have been a little bit stronger. Could you break out like maybe, between canola or the soybean, like, the general contribution from each of them? I mean, how big was the canola impact?","Ray G. Young","Again, we don't usually break that out. But as I indicated, the canola impact, in terms of the timing effects, it's within our normal ranges, but it was negative this month. And again, like I said, the normal range is $20 million to $30 million. The way I kind of look at the Oilseeds business is that we recorded, in the absence of timing effects, about $358 million for the quarter. I think that when I kind of analyze it and look at the canola effects and some other unique items, I actually felt that we were really running at around a $400 million quarterly rate for the Oilseeds business for the quarter, which I thought was actually a pretty good performance for the first quarter. So all in all, as Juan indicated, it was consistent with our expectations. And when I analyze it and break it down, I think that was more along a $400 million first quarter run rate for the business.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then, I guess, as we sort of look out ahead kind of over the rest of the year, I mean, in terms of your thought process in terms of capital allocation, I know you guys definitely outlined some steps a couple of weeks ago, but could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about dividends and share buybacks and even, potentially, getting back down in Australia? It sounds like the government is potentially giving you guys a second look in terms of getting involved in completing that acquisition down there. So could you provide any update on that?","Ray G. Young","As we -- Mike, as we indicated earlier, we were approaching this year on what we call a balanced approach towards capital allocation. So we're going to invest about $1.4 billion in CapEx and return about $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. That still remains our objective for the calendar year 2014. While we've gotten a slower start on the capital spending rate, which, by the way, normally, first quarter is a slower run rate in terms of CapEx within our company, and it was further exacerbated by some of the weather issues that we saw on the first quarter. But I don't think we've changed -- we've deviated in terms of our approach towards this balanced approach for 2014. I think maybe Pat will have a few more comments to say, too, here.","Patricia A. Woertz","You asked the question, Michael, about Australia, and I think our strategic rationale remains the same about our look at that part of the world: production region, its proximity to Asia. I think, long term, we're committed to that region. We hold an ownership stake, as you know, of just under 20% at GrainCorp. I think we have -- as we said before, they're looking for a new CEO, so they have an interim situation at the moment, and we're very respectful of that process. And I think once a new CEO is in place, we'll have the opportunity to work more closely, perhaps, with the management team to find additional ways to work together and drive value. I think the -- you mentioned outreach from government, et cetera. I don't think I have any news or anything to report this quarter on that stake.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then, finally, just on sweeteners and starches, I know the volumes have been off a little bit in terms of Mexico. Like, what are your sort of expectations kind of as we move through the rest of the year? Do you expect Mexico to improve at all or remain kind of a little bit softer, or what sort of impact are you seeing from the soda tax?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Michael. As we look forward, we see domestic demand pretty flat and Mexican volumes a little bit softer this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Farha Aslam from Stephens Incorporated.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Starting with ethanol, a bigger-picture question about kind where we are in the ethanol industry. We've noticed increased volume shipments to areas that we've never seen shipments before in size, places like Mexico, et cetera. Could you share with us sort of how the ethanol industry has matured and if we have really developed an active export environment that can be sustainable beyond Brazilian sugar up or down?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Farha, I think -- the way I tend to think about the ethanol industry, obviously, price drives a lot in the energy markets. And I think when we saw this kind of pricing, ethanol from the U.S. was basically the most competitive fuel in the world. And as such, it made it into a lot of formulations. When you run a refinery, you are always running an optimizer project, if you will, in which you're trying to get the cheapest formulation available. So these people have connections to every possible fuel component that you have. And as such, as the U.S. will always be competitive from time to time, even very, very, very competitive, you will continue to see that. So I think that the good thing is that this has opened several markets to us that we will be able to come back frequently. From the domestic perspective, I see the industry maturing. I see the industry expected to be relatively flattish in volumes but growing into its capacity. So we believe the period of us being able to achieve good returns is here. So we -- in these exports, we believe now that it's giving us a billion gallon type of amount, if you would, of markets that we have developed. And that, with a stable 13 billion, 13.5 billion gallon of U.S. market, makes us very optimistic about the future of the ethanol industry.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then, on biodiesel, while earnings were down sequentially, they were up year-over-year and were surprisingly high in the quarter, given that you don't have the biodiesel tax credit. Was there something in the quarter that allowed those profits to be higher than normal, or is that sort of a run rate that we can think about for the subsequent 3 quarters of the year?","Ray G. Young","Yes. I think -- I mean, you're looking at refining packaging and biodiesel, which, sequentially, is up quarter-over-quarter. I mean, like I said, there's a lot of items in that particular amount there. So, I mean, some of the other businesses in that segment actually did very, very well on a sequential basis. We also had some pretty good performance in European biodiesel this quarter as well, which kind of offset some of the impact on the North American biodiesel reduction.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And how sustainable is that European biodiesel profitability?","Ray G. Young","Generally, I think, yes, it's shown some recovery. I think, also, the absence of Argentine crush showing up into the world markets has also helped allow the European operations to generate some good margins, both on the crushing and the refining area.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my final question is on cocoa. Clearly, you've separated the process between your press and your chocolate. Could you give us any idea in terms of the size of the press business versus the chocolate business, either in terms of sales or in terms of percentage of profitability over a normal period?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, so we have about 6 chocolate facilities and about 10 cocoa processing facilities. And in terms of value, the chocolate business is about 1\/3 of the value of the total cocoa business, if that gives you a flavor for it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is more on the Ag Services side and the cyclical versus the structural changes going on out there. The USDA recently reported that on-farm storage for corn is now running at about -- well, for storage in general, it's running at about 13 billion bushels, and that's up from about 11 billion bushels a couple of years ago. So why wouldn't we anticipate that Ag Services margins are going to get inverted themselves, that there may not be the same opportunities at harvest time anymore, but maybe the opportunity for margins comes right before harvest, as farmers panic to get rid of their crops before the next harvest?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think that, certainly, on-farm storage tends to be highlighted much more when there is a smaller carryout. During years of big carryouts, I mean, we don't see that. When we look at the years in which we had peak profits for Ag Services, as we look into the past, these were years in which we had 2 consecutive years of very good crops in the U.S. So we truly expect the margin situation to change now with the resetting of the new crop coming in August, September, whenever it comes. So we believe on-farm storage would basically empty at this point. It would refill. We believe there's going to be a more normalization of margins as we go into the third quarter.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you wouldn't agree with the hypothesis that more on-farm storage gives farmers more pricing power? You think it's just seasonal?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","No, I think that there is an element of that, certainly. Yes.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up on your investment in Rennovia, could you just explain to us the strategic rationale for an investment in the developer of catalysts for renewable chemicals?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. When we look at the Corn business, we're always looking for opportunities to do more with the grind of corn. And one of the large opportunities is in to make some very selective number of chemicals. And Rennovia presents some catalysts and some technology that has -- that is very applicable for us to do so. So I think, for us, it's very important to have an alternative beyond ethanol or sweeteners, and we're always investing in that. So it's -- you have to see that as support of the Corn business, the profitability of returns of the Corn business going forward.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And any -- are you anticipating any impact on the Oilseeds business on the back of the PED virus?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think we haven't seen it yet, but this is looming in the horizon obviously. It hasn't gone away. So I would say, at one point in time, we may see maybe in a couple of quarters or something. But we haven't seen it yet.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. You haven't seen it yet. And when would you anticipate that, maybe, if it does impact your third or fourth quarter?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, something maybe at the end of second quarter, early third quarter, something in that range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have sort of a larger, sort of longer-term question about Ag Services. And, I guess, I'm staring at an ADM model that I built back in 2007, and this was long before ethanol got that big and corn exploded and stalks juiced got super tight. And back then, in the trailing years -- and I recognize that the segment is reported slightly differently now, but you weren't making that much money in Ag Services. You were making, I'm looking at some of these years, full year, you were making between $250 million and maybe $500 million. And now the expectation is that you should be getting to some $1 billion number on a full year basis. Should we really expect, in a market today that is well supplied globally at multiple points, whether it's the U.S., South America or Eastern Europe, should we really expect you to have really outstanding margin opportunities in this segment?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, certainly. Obviously, we have -- the opportunities in front of us depend a lot on discontinuities. When markets are very well supplied, as you described, sometimes there are less opportunities in front of us. But as I said before, when we see the 2 big deltas versus the profitability that we were expecting, we saw the lack of wheat carries that has been a big source of income for us over the last 2, 3 years. And also, this year's lack of a basis break didn't get us the ability to got a lot of cheap ownership, if you will, as we have done other years. So with the farmer not selling and the basis not breaking and then the weather getting in the way, I think that, that was the combination. Whether we want to come back completely to the $1 billion and whatever, we feel good about it because we have increased our footprint. We have made some investments in Eastern Europe and other places. And I think -- and we think, also, with the combination of Toepfer, I think we're going to be able to provide even more services through the value chain. We're going to extend the value chain all the way from origination to the destination markets. So we're working very, very hard to make that a stronger business. So we are very confident into the future of Ag Services. Yes, the business changed. The dynamics of the industry changes. We still believe that we are very well positioned to reap the reward for that into the future.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, one of the things that we read a lot about in the quarter but you didn't mention is the issue of China rejecting the U.S. corn because of the Syngenta Biotech trade. Was that something that affected you in the quarter, or was that just not even noticeable in your results?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","It didn't affect Ag Services per se, our grain business. It impacted our Toepfer subsidiary, and the impact was between Q4 and Q1. So we just finished with that. There is some charge in those numbers, but it was not that significant, to be honest.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe a higher-level question on returns and kind of the targets. In the first quarter, it looks like, on an annualized basis, you would have been about a 6.5% ROIC. The target for the full year, 200 basis points over WACC, would be about 8.5%, and on a long-term basis, 10%. And maybe any thoughts on how we should bridge kind of the first quarter performance to those shorter- and longer-term targets? Appreciate Ag Services is going to be a piece there, but how we should think about it in terms of costs, capital efficiency, investing in new growth businesses, et cetera?","Ray G. Young","Yes, a couple of comments, Adam. First of all, clearly, we had a few drags on our earnings in the first quarter. And as we highlighted, the Ag Services was not performing to the levels that we normally would expect associated with a company that will earn 200 basis points over WACC. So that's point number one. Point number two is the fact that it is -- ROIC is a 4-quarter trailing average basis, right? And so as we kind of still work through the remnants of the 4-quarter trailing average and you get into more normal conditions, we're confident that the returns on a 4-quarter trailing average will continue to improve as we move through calendar year 2014. So you're right. I mean, our annual WACC is 6.4%, and we'd like to get up to 8.4% for this calendar year. We've got some more work to do. We've got, frankly, some margin recovery in certain segments. And I still think we've got growth opportunities in the rest of the year in certain segments as well. So are we going to get there this year? Remains to be determined, but we're still working hard and are trying to achieve that.","Patricia A. Woertz","Adam, if I may add a few things just related to some of the work the company has underway to really reinforce this focus on returns and on EVA or economic value add. Obviously, it is a return over WACC times your -- the invested capital. And each of our businesses are looking more granularly at every one of those businesses within the business and even within the subsegments so that this improvement -- Juan talked, I think, very astutely about the 3 pillars of improving, the strengthening and improving the core business, working on our portfolio and on selected growth. And I think the business is working hard on, particularly, improving the core and on some of this selected growth, taking a very disciplined look at that capital spend.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, on that point, the $200 million of cost out that you alluded to being ahead of plan, any place in particular in the model we should be thinking about you realizing that -- those cost savings sooner than expected?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Well, there are 2 main drivers. One is energy efficiency, and you can put a big part of that in Corn. The second is procurement, and a lot of that is chemicals and things like that. There's a little bit of distribution between Oilseeds and Corn, if you will.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe last one for me. In the forward outlook and, I guess, in the last couple of calls, you made more discussion about the specialty proteins and specialty foods businesses in the company. And is there any way of quantifying how big that is today within Oilseeds? It's hard to really parse out how big of an earnings contributor that is today and what you aspire that business to be in the future.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. At this point, we don't want to disclose that number. It's providing us very good return. Certainly, it's in the high end of the returns, and it has potential. So it's -- we're very happy with the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Massoud, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Paul A. Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, first off, maybe this is a follow-up on the China rejections. I know you mentioned you didn't have any impact from China rejecting corn shipments, but mid to late quarter, we started seeing shipments of beans out of Brazil being canceled or rolled forward that were intended to be -- to go to China. So I was just curious if you could comment on that. I mean, was it purely just an issue of a weak environment in China during the quarter, or is there -- or do you think it might have been tied to some of the deleveraging that we saw that really impacted some of the other commodities that were out there?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think it was an issue of people learning from last year in which it was very difficult for Brazil to ship. And people with very tight inventories, I think they placed orders more than once. And then Brazil did a very good job this year in actually shipping everything, and the margins at that time in -- the crush margins in China were very, very negative. So we started to see some of those cancellations. Thankfully, those cancellations didn't impact us. We got paid in all of our shipments, so we -- we that's why we didn't report on that because it was not an impact that we had this quarter.","Paul A. Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then shifting towards ethanol. At the start of the year, I've seen estimates out there, and I think you had mentioned that you expected about 1 billion gallons of ethanol exports out of the U.S. We've seen some of the third-party estimates climb to 1.2 billion gallons for this year and estimates as high as 1.5 billion gallons into next year. And so my question is at what point does the U.S. logistical system start to get constrained? I mean, are we anywhere close to that? Could the U.S. export 1.5 billion gallons, or are we near capacity at the 1 billion gallon mark?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","No, we are not. We can export 1.5 billion. Other than the vagaries of weather and ice or snow or something like that, logistically, we can do it.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine Healy from Scotiabank.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","I've got a couple of questions to ask you on the sale of the fertilizer business, so probably for Ray. The first, I know it's currently in the Oilseeds Processing segment, but can you just tell us if that's tucked into the crushing, origination? And then second, can you give us a sense for the earnings so we can strip it from our numbers? I'm assuming it'll be classified as a discontinued op next quarter.","Ray G. Young","Well, first of all, it is in crushing and origination. Second, we haven't disclosed the specific magnitudes. As we kind of go through the process, we'll make a determination as to whether we will classify it in the future as discontinued ops or -- so we'll let you know as we kind of move through our earnings next quarter.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Okay. So when do you expect the transaction to close?","Ray G. Young","Again, as you know, in Brazil, there's always the regulatory approvals and all that stuff. I mean, we'd like to get it done by the end of the calendar year, if possible. That's what we're trying to strive towards. But again, there's a lot of work to do in terms of the segregation aspects and the regulatory aspects.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And then, on the soy protein plant in Brazil, can you give us a little bit of color there on expected capacity of the plant and when you expect work to be completed on it?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","It's difficult to talk about the capacity of the plant because it produces many, many different specialty products, and they have several units of operations. So every plant that we build around the world is different and will depend, the output, on the product mix as we develop the market. And the plant will probably take 15 to 18 months to be completed.","Operator","Your next question comes from Diane Geissler from CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about the concept of the annual WACC. You gave your long-term WACC rate at 8%. I'm assuming that is what you're using when you run your hurdle rate through your investments. But is the annual WACC a target? So you're targeting ROIC 200 basis points above your annual WACC? Is this what you're using to compensate management? Because I guess what I'm not understanding is that, if your long-term WACC is 8%, your goal on your return should be 200 basis points on top of the 8%, not 200 basis points on top of a WACC that's been benefiting from low treasury rates.","Ray G. Young","A couple of comments, Diane. First of all, 8% is our long-term WACC. And you're absolutely right, when we make long-term investment decisions and we make hurdle rates, we use hurdle rates to determine long-term investments, M&A, we use 8% WACC in order to kind of help establish those hurdle rates. And so we add a spread on top of this 8% to arrive at these hurdle rates for investment purposes. And as interest rates environment in the world increases, eventually, back to more normal levels, I mean, the annual WACC and the long-term WACC should converge. Okay, so that's point one. Point two, in the current environment where interest rates are low in the world -- and our commodity markets, when you think about how commodity markets are pricing carries, et cetera, et cetera, I mean, it is based upon short-term interest rates. So in order to evaluate our teams, you have to use current conditions, and that's the reason why we use annual WACC in order to try to evaluate current performance based upon how the market factors are. But again, I'm convinced that, long term, as interest rates in the world converge to normality, both annual WACC and the long-term WACC will converge.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","But wouldn't you agree, if the interest rate environment is below its historic rate, that lower returns, then, look artificially better simply because you're comparing it against some unsustainable level, some unsustainable bar?","Ray G. Young","The whole market, Diane -- if the whole market is basically pricing on the basis of short-term interest rates, then that's the comparison to use. Because that's how the market is pricing everything right now. Price of carries, I mean, you calculate carries in the marketplace, I mean, that's all based upon short-term interest rates, not long-term interest rates.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. All right. Can I just get you to comment on the fructose business? I think you said volumes were flattish in the U.S., you expected them to be down in Mexico. What's your long-term view on the impact of the beverage tax in Mexico? And also, to the extent that we've heard sort of increasing commentary that something is coming down the pike in the U.S., similar to what we have in Mexico, what does that mean for the sweeteners and starches business, longer term? And then if you could also -- where are your contacts priced at this year? I don't think you gave an outlook on the pricing environment.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","So in terms of the impact of the soda tax in Mexico, very -- it's too early to tell whether it is curtailing demand or what's going to be the impact on demand. Some people, obviously, are increasing prices of the beverages. So to what extent -- what is the elasticity of that? I mean, it's too early. We will see. So at this point in time, I'm repeating myself here, we see kind of flat for the U.S. and slightly down in Mexico. That slightly down in Mexico has a correlation to the margin environment. Obviously, the capacity utilization is a little bit more lax this year than other years, and that has impacted pricing discussions. So that's the environment as we see it. And the business has done a very good job, Diane, in balancing on that the lower costs that we have and the ability to swing to more profitable products. So we were very happy with our results so far. And you heard me about the Rennovia investment. We continue to do a lot in order to bring more grind to improve the competitive position of Corn business so we have other options as well. So this investment in Rennovia is also to develop some chemicals that we can continue to add more swing capacity so we can make sweeteners, so we can make ethanol, we can make chemicals. So if we broaden the portfolio, we improve our options.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Where is Rennovia in the stage of development of new products out of the grind?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Rennovia is actually a -- is a collaboration in which we invested in them to get catalysts on some processes. We will take those catalysts and bring into our plants. So this is probably 18 months away, if you will, in terms of something happening on our side. It's more a research investment deal.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have kind of a follow-up here on Mexico, U.S. sweeteners. I think U.S. sugar industry groups recently filed something with the ITC saying that Mexico is dumping sugar into the U.S. market. Is there a risk that Mexico follows up and issues some kind of a ban on imports of HFCS or restrictions on imports as a result of this?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Rob, this is Juan. We obviously -- we opposed the petition because we believe that it interferes with the intent of NAFTA, and we're all for free trade here. Beyond that, it would be speculative to comment on the impact this petition may or may not have in the different markets or in the different governments. So we're watching it very closely. We are cooperating with the authorities and participating, giving our statements where we are required. Other than that, it's too early, probably.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is the next step here a decision by Mexico's agricultural ministry, what they decide to say about allowing imports? Is that what we're waiting for?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","No, I think it's a U.S. decision. But you're taking me into areas that I'm not an expert, Robert. So...","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Larson from CL King.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on CapEx. Obviously, you were below last year in the first quarter. Is it a timing difference? Is it timing why the CapEx was a little lower in Q1? Is it -- are you still sticking with your original CapEx budget for 2014 going forward?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Eric, it's a combination of factors. First of all, when we give an indication at the beginning of the year, it doesn't mean that we will invest that amount if we don't find good opportunities. Normally, we have a slow ramp-up just because the weather -- with the weather we have in the first quarter, it's not very conducive to be doing external work. So -- but I would say, the way we're going this year is probably closer to maybe $1.2 billion or something in that range that we are spending at this -- but it will be back-end loaded, if you will.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick comment kind of on the current grain markets. They're -- obviously, it looks like we have our first kind of weather premium in grain prices right now, and the curves are inverted, flat, down, up. It's just a very strange grain market right now in virtually all of the grains. Can you give us your perspective on where you think planting progress is at the moment?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, the corn seems to be 19% this week. I think it's below the 5-year average, but certainly ahead of last year. We saw a significant improvement this week, and I think that we feel good. We saw, last year, the ability of the U.S. farmer to plant -- to make planting progress in a week is fantastic. So the weather forecast looks all right. So there may be a couple of days in which -- it's raining right now here, so we may have a little bit of a delay, but we feel very good about it. There are no issues at this point in time.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Are you starting to see farmers -- with current cash prices up fairly sharply over the last 8 weeks or so, are you starting to see the farmers depart with their corn? Because they've got to have their bins empty by the end of July, early August, if they plan on refilling them.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","We saw -- as prices spiked in March and the weather improved, we saw some increased corn selling, yes, more opportunistic kind of thing. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just going through with some clean-up questions. Are you guys hedging ethanol this quarter?","Ray G. Young","Sorry, can you repeat the question, Ken, again?","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Are you -- are we you going to have the same hedging issues that we had last quarter that we will have in this quarter on ethanol? Are you guys hedged, or are you guys letting it float?","Ray G. Young","What we've done, Ken, is we've actually been able to change, in the middle of March, our approach in terms of accounting for the hedges on ethanol. So we were able to get a cash flow hedge accounting treatment in the middle of March. So going forward, you should not expect to see from us any significant timing effects on ethanol, as we'll be able to defer any gains and losses to the period of execution.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So, so far this quarter, your ethanol margins are running higher than last quarter, is that fair?","Ray G. Young","Yes. Generally, that's correct. That's correct.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","How much of Ag Services was penalized this quarter by weather?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Difficult to say, but maybe in the range of $20 million to $30 million.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Do you expect basis to come back in the summer?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Later in the summer, maybe.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Even though the farmers will sell corn throughout the summer? So that would be a surprise to you if the basis actually weakened into the summer as farmers sold, like June and July?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think it's too soon to tell. We've been making prognostications, and we've been disappointed about the Ag Services and the weather market. So...","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And to go back to Eric's question really quick, I doubt his question was actually what the USDA said. What do you guys think about the planting progress relative to the 19% that they reported? Do you think that's accurate? Do you think that's low? Do you think that's high? Can you guys talk about that, based on your guys' market intelligence?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, with Tim, as I said, it's very optimistic about that. I think that it's pretty much in the range. I mean, I think that they are not concerned about that.","Patricia A. Woertz","Certainly, around here, Ken, Illinois planted a lot in its last dry week. So that's an example of, I think, we feel very good.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then, look, you guys have done a lot with value-added cost savings. There seems to be still a lot of liquidity and cash. Like how do you guys look at the timing to which you guys will deploy cash to a meaningful level that investors should be able to see something returned back to them?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, some of this is opportunistic, Ken, as you know. If it's about some opportunity piece that relate to small or even sizable strategic M&A, that depends on where you are in that opportunity or in that discussion. Certainly, we talked about a balanced approach to use of cash. So on just a straightforward basis, our dividend and share repurchase is on track to what we have talked about over the year, being each quarter ratable, and I think that $1.4 billion for this current year is what we're looking at for returns to shareholders.","Ray G. Young","I think it's also fair to say, Ken, and we've talked about this in the past, our balance sheet's extremely strong. And frankly, when you take a look at how we're going to deploy capital and generate returns for our shareholders, there's no doubt that we are looking for opportunities to further grow the business aggressively and generate value from it. So while, again, our capital spending was at a slower rate in the first quarter, we do have a lot of different projects in our pipeline that we're analyzing. And frankly, as we move through the rest of this calendar year, we're confident that we'll be able to actually announce some of these projects and talk more about the returns that we're going to generate from the projects. At the same time, we are going to be disciplined. We're not going to invest for the sake of investing. We are focused on returns. And frankly, as you get to the end of the calendar year, if we conclude that there are not as many projects as we would have liked to invest in, we're going to look at returns of capital to our shareholders again beyond what we've talked about initially.","Patricia A. Woertz","And I'll add to Ray's point here to just make the point that we have a lot of optimism about these pillars, that we plan to improve the business, work on the portfolio and invest for growth. And often, these quarterly calls, you don't get the chance to talk about the investment for growth as much. So as Ray said, I think we feel very good about this pipeline of looks we have. And we'll probably plan for an investor day much later in the year, and we're looking at the chance to do some deep dives into both our look backs on capital spend, on our progress that we've made on improving the business, on the churn of the portfolio, as well as on these investments for the future.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So let me ask 2 follow-ups. One is, why wait to the end of the year? Calendar year is just an arbitrary year end, right? It doesn't really mean anything. Why wait till the year end to buy back stock? And second, you have the floor in terms of growth. What do you think all of this is going to add up to in terms of earnings? So it gives you the option to be able to say where you guys think your earnings are going to go.","Ray G. Young","Yes, Ken. If we didn't feel confident that we have good investment prospects in front of us for the rest of the year, then we would be buying back stock more aggressively. So the fact that we're not buying back beyond what we've indicated indicates that we do have tangible projects -- tangible projects out there that we're looking at. And as we indicated, I think we'll be able to announce some of these as we kind of move through the calendar year.","Patricia A. Woertz","And Ken, to your -- also to your point of our earnings power, we've kind of plateaued at this $3 level. And we're hopeful that, not only this year, but this year and beyond had that pivotal point to be able to have that earnings power at a much higher level. So again, that's our intention. That's our plans. That is where not only the numerator needs to grow, but the full returns level needs to grow, and that's what we'll do.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You're still holding hope you get over $3 this year?","Patricia A. Woertz","We don't get that specific with it. But certainly, the latter half of the year has good opportunity for us, absolutely.","Operator","And your final question comes from David Driscoll from Citi Research.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one question for me on ethanol. The -- on the RFS, do you expect the EPA to raise the 2014 RVO on its final rule? And then second, and perhaps this is even more important, do you expect the 2015 RVO to step up ethanol demand? And will this be enough to drive significant implementation of E15?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","It is difficult to speculate on what the EPA will do, David. As I've said, I think we look at this industry as having matured. I have been getting to the point in which there is some discipline in the industry. There is people feeling good about running it at almost capacity. And we have developed enough optionality, whether it's E85, E15 or export market that the economics had been driving, that actually, we feel very optimistic about being able to achieve our return objectives in the ethanol market.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But you're not -- you can't really make any statement about support from Washington? I still feel like support from them is important or even critical for the development of E15 and just like your thoughts.","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, we do expect them to say something by June. I think the number will change, but what it will change to, I can't say. Think about it as providing a floor on demand, and the economics drive all the upside to that. So yes, stay tuned. We'll see what comes out.","Operator","Thanks you, everyone. That brings our Q&A portion to a close. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Patricia Woertz for closing remarks.","Patricia A. Woertz","Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We do have a list of our upcoming investor events on, I think, it's Slide 15.

All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Christina Hahn, Vice President of Investor Relations for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Ms. Hahn, you may begin.","Christina Hahn","Thanks Stephanie. For those following the presentation, please turn to Slide 2, the company\u2019s Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results.","These statements are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its report on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation, and you should carefully review the assumptions and factors in our SEC reports. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.","On today\u2019s call, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Woertz, will provide an overview of the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Juan Luciano, will review the drivers of our operations performance in the quarter and provide an update on actions that are improving returns. Then they will take your questions.","Please now turn to Slide 3. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Woertz","Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone to our third quarter conference call. This morning we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.81, and adjusted segment operating profit1 of $914 million. Our net earnings were $747 million, or $1.14 per share. Segment operating profit1 was $1.07 billion.","The team delivered very strong results in the third quarter and made significant progress improving earnings and returns. Corn Processing managed their product mix to serve good demand and optimize margins. Continued improvement in international merchandising results supported the ongoing recovery of Ag Services. And Oilseeds Processing again delivered solid results overall, benefiting from good demand and its diverse footprint and product portfolio.","We also continued to advance our portfolio management. Since the beginning of the third quarter, we signed a deal to sell our global chocolate business; we reached an agreement to acquire Specialty Commodities Incorporated; and we completed our acquisition of WILD Flavors.","In mid-October, we completed our previously announced buyback of 18 million shares, and that is ahead of our year-end target. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our strong cash flows, we expect to repurchase up to 10 million more shares by the end of 2014.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray Young","Thanks Pat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.81 per share compared to $0.47 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $914 million, up $282 million or nearly 45% from last year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 28% compared to 32% in the third quarter of the prior year.","We had some favorable book tax adjustments, about $36 million in aggregate this third quarter, which helped which helped lower the tax rate versus last year. Looking forward into the fourth quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 30%.","Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 8.5%, improved from the 7.7% at the end of the second quarter and also significantly improved by 280 basis points from the 5.7% at the end of the third quarter last year. The 8.5% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.4% annual WACC for 2014, as well as our long-term WACC of 8% as reflected in the graph on Slide 18 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over WACC.","In the third quarter, our trailing four-quarter average EVA was $553 million based upon adjusted earnings and the annual WACC. On Chart 17 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.14 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.81 per share.","For this quarter, LIFO represented a $315 million pretax credit or $0.30 per share after-tax as commodity prices significantly decreased through the quarter. We also incurred a charge of $102 million pretax or about $0.10 per share related to the hedging of the anticipated euro cash outflows related to the equity purchase of WILD Flavors. The euro depreciated significantly in September thereby creating losses on these hedges.","However, economically compared to when ADM signed the purchase agreement on July 5, ADM\u2019s total purchase price of the equity was $114 million lower net of these hedging losses, benefiting from the overall depreciation of the euro.","In the quarter, we also booked $156 million pretax gain or about $0.15 per share related to the expansion of the ADM-Marubeni joint venture.","Lastly, our income tax expense for the quarter includes a charge of $0.02 per share to bring year-to-date tax expense in line with the latest anticipated tax rate for the full-year.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. I would like to highlight some unique or specified items in the operating results. Juan\u2019s discussion of the operating results will exclude the specified items and net timing effects, so that you can understand the underlying trends in the business.","In this third quarter, hedge timing effects were generally small in cocoa and in corn. It did not have any significant impact on our results. In Ag Services, I referenced earlier the $156 million booked gain. We converted our 45% equity interest in the Kalama Export Company joint venture in the Pacific Northwest with Marubeni into a 30% equity interest into a new larger Pacificor joint venture that succeeded the Kalama JV.","The non-cash book gain is generated from the estimated values of the additional assets contributed by Marubeni into the larger Pacificor JV for additional shares, which resulted in a dilution of ADM\u2019s equity interest from 45% to 32%.","Final valuations of the assets being contributed with occur in the fourth quarter, and to the extent there is any material changes in this final valuation from the preliminary valuation, there would be a true-up in the fourth quarter results.","So the difference between our adjusted operating profit of $914 million and the segment operating profit of $1.07 billion is primarily just book gain. In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to significantly lower debt levels. Unallocated corporate costs were slightly higher due to various projects including our ERP project that was initiated earlier this year.","Other charges were significantly higher due primarily to the $102 million realized loss on foreign exchange hedges on the WILD equity purchase that I referred to earlier.","As I indicated, our overall purchase price in U.S. dollar terms was $114 million lower, net of these hedge losses.","A minority interest in other was significantly higher after absorbing $56 million of net losses or about $0.09 per share after-tax booked in this quarter related to updated valuations of the portfolio investments at CIP, a joint venture which targets investments in food, feed ingredients and bioproducts businesses, in which ADM holds a 43.7% equity interest. And just for clarity, we did not add back this $0.09 per share charge to our adjusted EPS.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. We present here the cash flow statement for the nine months ending September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year. We generated just over $1.9 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first nine months of 2014, compared to $1.4 billion last year.","Working capital changes were source of $2.5 billion so far this year, compared to a source of $3.4 billion last year. Total capital spending for the nine months was slightly above $600 million, which is lower than our 2013 spend of $694 million, including small acquisitions. We indicated in early July with the announcement of the larger transaction, that we will be reducing the capital spending in 2014 to about $900 million before the ERP program expenditures, down from our original $1.4 billion plan.","After changes in working capital and investments, our free cash flow for the first nine months was about $3.8 billion. In February, our $1.15 billion convertible debt matured and we paid down this debt, contributing to our overall debt reduction so far this year. In the first nine months of this year, we spent about $700 million to repurchase about 16 million shares, and we paid out $470 million in common dividends. So far in the first nine months, we returned about $1.2 billion to shareholders.","We finished out the quarter with 653 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis and 650 million basic shares. In the month of October, with the pull back in the equity markets, we completed the repurchase of the 18 million shares we had originally targeted at the beginning of the year.","Slide 7 shows the highlights for our balance sheet as of September 30 for both 2014 and 2013. Cash on hand was approximately $4.9 billion, up $1.4 billion from last year. Our operating working capital of $8.2 billion was down $2.2 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1 billion related to lower inventory prices and about $0.2 billion related to lower inventory quantities, and a decrease of about $1 billion in other working capital items.","Total debt was about $5.5 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash, of $0.7 billion, down significantly from the 2013 net debt level of $3.4 billion. Our shareholders\u2019 equity of $20.3 billion is $0.7 billion higher than the level last year.","We had $6.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we had access to almost $12 billion of liquidity.","As you know, we closed on the WILD acquisition on October 1, with a total cash outflow net of hedge losses of about $2.9 billion. We were able to finance the acquisition using our existing liquidity and financing lines.","Earlier, we indicated that we completed the purchase of our 18 million shares of ADM stock in the month of October. In view of this strong balance sheet position in cash flow generation, we intend to continue with our opportunistic stock repurchases in the month of November and December, buying back up to 10 million more shares.","We are working through our four business plans at present and we will more to say about our future capital allocation philosophy and capital allocation plans at our upcoming Investor Day.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Ray. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. I will start with segment operating profit and then move on to discuss the three major segments.","Our underlying segment operating profit has improved sequentially each quarter of this year. In the third quarter, it increased 12% from the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, significant improvements in Corn and Ag Services drove an overall increase of 45%. In each quarter of this year, the team has delivered year-over-year improvements in segment operating profit. I\u2019ll walk through our third quarter results now.","Starting on Slide 9, the oilseeds team delivered another solid quarter, with ample crop availability and a strong demand, European rapeseed crushing led a significant improvement in the softseed crushing globally. In soybean crushing, South American and European operations ran hard amid improved margins.","In North America, the tight all crop being carried out led to record crush margins in the third quarter. Lower global commodity prices reduced third quarter farmer selling in South America, limiting origination volumes there.","In Europe, with vegetable oils low-cost relatively to other energy sources, we had good biodiesel capacity utilization and improved margins during the quarter. The cocoa team ran assets harder in the improved margin environment and our results from Asia reflected weaker second quarter by Wilmar.","Please turn now to Slide 10. The Corn Processing team delivered yet another strong quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, the seasonal decline in U.S. gasoline demand drove ethanol inventories higher and industry margins lower. Our flex capacity gave us opportunities to run different product mixes and to maximize overall margins. Corn-based ethanol is still the lowest cost obtaining enhance around the market and exports remain strong.","The sweeteners and starches team continued to optimize their product, plans and customer mix and leveraged swing capacity to optimize returns. While selling prices were lower as expected, volumes remained steady.","Our focused supply chain and cost management actions and our flexible business model, help us capture improve margins. Our work to diversify our grain into more stable and higher value earnings streams is delivering results.","Turn to Slide 11 please. In the third quarter, Ag Services\u2019 results improved as the team managed the transition between crops. In the U.S., we saw the normal decline in grain exports in July and August. With the start of the harvest, volumes picked up in September with near record volumes on all commodities out of the Gulf.","The international merchandizing team delivered significant improvements in nearly all regions and products, as we continued to see the benefits of the Toepfer integration.","In transportation, as the U.S. Midwest replenished salt and fertilizer inventories, our barge freight business saw about 20% year-over-year increase in northbound loads and higher average freight rates. And our trucking teams saw volumes and rate increase as they helped ADM operations and third-party customers manage through a challenging U.S. logistics environment.","Milling results were down this quarter relatively to a year-ago, due to a mix of factors resulting in lower margins.","Now on Slide 12, we wanted to briefly update you on our actions that are driving improved returns. We focused, as you know, those efforts in a few areas; strengthening the business, managing our portfolio and growing the business.","In the area of strengthening the business, we remain on-track to achieve our total of $400 million in ongoing cost savings by the end of the year.","In the area of managing our portfolio, we completed the acquisition of WILD Flavors adding to our offering, one of the world\u2019s leading suppliers of natural ingredients to the food and beverage industries. Our new business unit, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, will begin reporting on January 1.","We further expanded our specialty ingredients portfolio with an agreement to purchase Specialty Commodities Incorporated, a leading originator processor and distributor of healthy ingredients including nuts, fruits, seeds, legumes and ancient grains.","We strengthened our export capabilities via the U.S. Pacific Northwest converting our ownership stake in a single export terminal in Kalama Washington into a stake in a new larger joint venture called Pacificor that includes the second export terminal in Portland, Oregon.","We also reached an agreement to sell our global chocolate business to Cargill, and we are on-track to close that sale in the first half of 2015. The sale of our South American fertilizer business to Mosaic is set to close by the end of this year. And last week, we changed the name of our Golden Peanut business to Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts, as we announced the acquisition of Harrell Nut Company, one of the largest sellers and processors of pecans in the United States.","Now moving on to our efforts to improve returns by growing the business. Construction continues in our sweetener and fiber plants in Tianjin, China; our feed premix plant in Nanjing, China; and our specialty protein complex in Campo Grande, Brazil. The expansion of our Fibersol production capacity in Clinton, Iowa, is on schedule to be operational in mid-2015.","As part of the consolidation and efficiency plan, we opened an addition to our flour mill at Beech Grove, Indiana, making that facility the third largest flour mill in the United States. This addition replaced less-efficient capacity that we have shuttered and our Non-GMO lecithin project in Hamburg, Germany and Latur, India, should be operational in April and July respectively.","So as you can see, this was a very active quarter for the team. We continue making progress strengthening the business and that progress is reflected in our returns. Pat?","Pat Woertz","Turning to Slide 13 before we start Q&A. Thank you, Juan. Listening to that long list of activities this quarter that Juan just outlined, I reflect that for the past many quarters how focused we\u2019ve been on actions to improve earnings and returns. And in this quarter on, many portfolio changes. And also we moved and opened a new global headquarters and customers center.","The risk is during times like these that our teams becomes distracted or results slip. I am so proud of this team. They didn\u2019t miss the beat with focus and discipline delivering very strong results during a very busy quarter.","With that operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, good morning everyone.","Pat Woertz","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Just a couple of questions. One is can you talk about your results in high-fructose corn syrup, that kind of exceeded our expectations. I didn\u2019t know, if how much of that is repeatable, how you kind of think about it with just your intellectual capital to just no at a price of corn side of it. Can you just give us a heads up on that?","Juan Luciano","Sure, Ken. Good morning. This is Juan. As you said, very good results in sweeteners and starches. The volumes were steady driven by pretty much stronger domestic shipments and volume also from other products. Your heard us saying before that we\u2019ve diversified to other products. So we saw corn syrup, we saw dextrose volumes going up. And the Mexican volume, as we\u2019ve been reporting, has been down but better than expected.","The demand there remains stronger than anticipated. So with our ability to flex capacity and optimize transportation and optimize product mix, we continue to see results in sweeteners and the starches that are exceeding our own expectations to be honest, our own forecasts.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","And do you expect this to be repeatable? Is this something that is an ongoing trend, or is this something that was specific to the quarter?","Juan Luciano","No, I think that this is driven by the improvements that our team is doing in managing this. So you know, Q4 is seasonally a little bit lower from a demand perspective, but we expect these results to continue in the future.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great. And I have to ask the same question I probably ask every single time, but I got to ask anyway. If I think about your earnings power back to those couple of years where \u2013 the three or four years that you were in $3 of earnings, can you \u2013 and you\u2019ve cut down costs by about $400 million which is about $0.40, you\u2019re buying back stock another $0.03, you\u2019re making acquisitions, you\u2019re deploying capital. Is there a framework besides the 200 basis points upon return on investment capital, that kind of can get us closer to what you kind of think will be your earnings power over the next \u2013 again year to three years and the progression of that?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I think as you described, we\u2019ve done a bulk of things trying to improve returns. And I think that a lot of them are in the process of being executed, as you see some of the portfolio management are in the process of being close those transactions. Some of the operational improvements are already rolling into the bottom line and will continue to do so.","And then there are some things that are, we\u2019re going to experience for the first time probably like Ag Services and running our assets at full utilization based on this new record crop that we will have in the United States. So I think that we are gathering all that information to determine a little bit what is our next \u2013 our new level of earnings power.","But we are as encouraged as your comments are, in terms of all the things that we\u2019re doing to get the company better and the returns.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Will we hear from you on a little bit more specifics at the Analyst Day?","Juan Luciano","You will hear from me on the Analysts Day. That\u2019s for sure. Yes, we will provide a little bit more in the Analyst Day.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak. Your line is open.","Tim Tiberio \u2013 Miller Tabak","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Juan, looking at the large size of the crop, I know the harvesting progress has been a bit behind the schedule, but at this point, is there any reason why we should not think that Ag Services could be back to normalized levels, or if not even greater, at this point?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Tim. As you said, the harvest is progressing normally. I will say normally for soybean, a little bit maybe behind for corn. So we are very optimistic about the first part of the harvest. We are very optimistic about the results we are seeing right now in Ag Services, and we expect very good result for Ag Services going forward, yes.","Tim Tiberio \u2013 Miller Tabak","And would you expect that maybe the mix shifts a little bit more towards ADM making more money on storage versus transportation and logistics?","Juan Luciano","Yes. I think the grain business will pick-up versus this quarter. This quarter was basically, the performance was driven very much by a strong international merchandizing and transportation, but grain obviously July and August, we didn\u2019t have much movement. So yes, we expect grain results to pick-up in Q4.","Tim Tiberio \u2013 Miller Tabak","Okay. And then just lastly, we\u2019ve seen quite a spike in soy meal, there has been some speculation around logistics being difficult for livestock producers, there is also been some questions around quality of the actual protein in the soy meal. Can you kind of give us your thoughts of how \u2013 what ADM is seeing in the market, how you\u2019re positioned logistically. And whether you expect this to be, both, an opportunity or a challenge for the business into Q4?","Juan Luciano","Sure. So we always refer, Tim, to the footprint that we have in both of our businesses \u2013 in the processing businesses in corn and soybeans or oilseeds. And this is another example in which the soybean footprint that we have given us great access to soybean. So from an inbound freight perspective, we don\u2019t rely that much on rail and that has been most of the problem in the U.S. So we rely a lot on trucking.","So we haven\u2019t had a lot of problems in getting beans into our plants. Obviously we knew that logistics problems could happen in Q3 and Q4, so we have prepared for that. So I will say no problems coming in. Coming out, we also \u2013 as I said, we prepare so we haven\u2019t seen any problems. We\u2019ve been able to deliver to our customers as per schedule.","And this is where some of our previous investments in transportation in all the modes of transportations are paying off. And I think the pipeline was empty, and we knew that it was going to be transition to refill that pipeline. It was a little bit of maybe panic selling from some of the customers at one point in time. We think that that has subsided now. And so we think we transition into the new crop. But all in all, I would say that the transportation team and the oilseed teams have performed very well, have plants running at high capacity, and actually customers very well supplied. So all in all, I think we have a great team doing pretty well there.","Tim Tiberio \u2013 Miller Tabak","Thanks Juan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research","Yes, good morning. Couple of questions on ethanol. The margins had been quite solid and there has been obviously pretty big seasonal sell-off kind of post-Labor Day, but as you kind of look out into 2015, what do you think is the effective operating capacity for total U.S. production?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Michael, as you said, margins were very good during the quarter and then they drop as driving miles came reduced after the summer. So what we see for 2015 is pretty much something relatively similar to what we saw in 2014, because we\u2019ve seen actually about the same amount of export capacity, so in the range of 800 million gallon to maybe a billion gallon. And then about the same domestic demand, so maybe 13.5 something in that range. So we expect 14.3 or something in that range for total production on an estimated capacity out there, something in the range of 14.5 to 14.7 depending on how much that capacity is actually running.","Michael Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research","Okay. And can you give us any sense for kind of how far you\u2019re hedged along in 4Q at this point?","Juan Luciano","Yes, in any particular quarter we go sometimes between 25% and 75%. So I would say a little bit under 50% maybe.","Michael Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research","Okay, great. And then what are your thoughts on specifically the exports to Brazil in next couple of months?","Juan Luciano","Listen, Brazil is having a lot of movements at this point in time. You see, they approved increasing the blending grades to 27.5%. We have been able, as an industry, to diversify very much the sources of our exports. So it\u2019s going to Canada, Mexico, Middle East, Asia, and sometimes to Brazil. So we\u2019re now very dependent on Brazil. So we feel pretty good about the sustainability of our exports. Our own export program is very strong from Q4 and extends well into 2015. So we feel good about it.","Michael Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research","Okay. Thank you very much.","Juan Luciano","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi good morning.","Juan Luciano","Hello Ann.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 you noted that you expect the meal demand to pick-up domestically in the quarter. What\u2019s going to drive that pick-up in demand? And then what are you seeing out there from DDGs in terms of competition with meal?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I think we saw \u2013 as I said before, the pipeline was a little bit empty. We still see strong demand domestically and for exports for meal in the United States. DDGs are finding their way into the market by pricing themselves into the market. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of impact yet in to soybean meal to be honest. Our book continues to be very solid for the few coming months.","So we expect, Ann, crushing margins to be strong this quarter and weigh into late Q1. As we see Brazil maybe having a little bit of late planting, we might have a little bit more of a tail U.S. exporting late into Q1 next year.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thank you. And then just from a modeling perspective, how should we model WILD Flavors for this upcoming quarter? I know it will be a separate segment I think you said from the start of next year, but just from a modeling perspective, how should we think about it this quarter?","Ray Young","Ann, it\u2019s Ray here. So you\u2019ll find \u2013 we\u2019ll report WILD as part of the other segment as we kind of go through the transition this fourth quarter and setting up the fourth business unit. And so I expect that we\u2019re going to have a lot of transaction closing costs related to WILD. And so those types of transaction costs will kind of offset some of the operating profits that WILD will generate.","So I\u2019d say that for the fourth quarter for modeling purposes, you should view as fairly immaterial. Frankly, we\u2019re going to have a good start from January 1 with the fourth segment, and I just encourage you to start modeling the fourth segment modeling the WILD effective January 1.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thanks. And then just finally, a quick follow-up on ethanol. What\u2019s your outlook for margins going forward, given oil prices in where they are trending?","Juan Luciano","Yes. Ethanol margins basically were pretty healthy in Q3 and then they dropped significantly as inventories climbed, but you see that the industry is behaving a little bit different now maybe better supply\/demand fundamentals. And the inventory is starting to correct. And we\u2019ve seen that correction and that reduction in October. And margins have since the end of September actually improved a little bit.","So we expect some of these volatility that we described before to continue but it\u2019s been \u2013 the industry is behaving in a much better way this year than we saw for example last year.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","So margins steady to down maybe just on lower oil prices. Is that the right way to think about it?","Juan Luciano","I think if you think versus Q3, margins will be softer than Q3.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Juan Luciano","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc","Hi good morning.","Pat Woertz","Good morning, Farha.","Ray Young","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc","Just kind of a big picture question. We\u2019ve seen a lot of FX movements around the world recently. I was just wondering, how does ADM manage through that? Are these positives or negatives with your expanded international footprint?","Ray Young","Farha, it\u2019s Ray here. What\u2019s interesting is in the third quarter with all the movements of FX, the actual translation impact for this company was less than $5 million unfavorable. So you can tell that, we actually have a fairly balanced footprint. As you know, we hedge generally transactional exposures, but we also have a fairly balanced cost and revenue footprint as well. So generally speaking, whenever you see the volatility of the FX occur, you don\u2019t usually see us reporting FX as being a major driver of our profitability.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc","Okay, so a little impact. And then when we look at the timing of crops and the opportunities of crop availability, the U.S. harvest is coming in a little late. Does that affect and push out earnings from the fourth quarter into the March quarter, just to start with the U.S., sorry \u2013 is that how we should think about it, or are you seeing just rate bases opportunities in the U.S. in Ag Services?","Juan Luciano","Farha, this is Juan. We still see very good opportunities for Q4 for Ag Services. It\u2019s still probably too early to call that some will overspill into Q1.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc","Okay. And then just going down to Brazil and Argentina. Have the farmers in Argentina started to sell any movements on that. And then in Brazil, if you could just provide us an update on sort of crush opportunities in Brazil and export opportunities there?","Juan Luciano","Yes. I would say in Argentina, the farmers sold a little bit with all these rally in soybeans, but they still hold maybe 18 million tonnes of soybeans over there of crops. So nothing materially has changed, although we\u2019ve seen a little bit more movement.","A little bit the same in Brazil. You know in our remarks, we highlighted the lack of farmers selling in Brazil. We saw recently over the last few days, up until the elections a little bit of a better selling, but still reluctant seller \u2013 still way behind last year in terms of selling.","In terms of exports from Brazil. Brazil, due to the big inverse exported very early on into the season. So there is not much to export now. So we are watching the planting and the growing next.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc","Great. And my final question relates to ethanol and Mexico. You highlighted, Juan, the octane value ethanol. Are you seeing Mexico potentially increase the amount of ethanol it takes from the U.S. simply as an octane and do you see ethanol replacing MTBE in Mexico over the long-term?","Juan Luciano","Yes, as you described we have seen markets after markets changing away from MTBE. Obviously Mexico is one of those markets that are still in MTBE. So we see that as a potential opportunity ahead of us, sure.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc","Okay, great. Thank you.","Juan Luciano","You\u2019re welcome.","Pat Woertz","Thanks Farha.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Your line is open.","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi Research","Thank you and good morning.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, David.","Pat Woertz","Good morning, David.","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi Research","I wanted to follow-on some of these ethanol questions. In the fourth quarter, Juan, you mentioned that you had about 50% in the business hedged. Is it fair to say that they were hedged at rates similar to the third quarter and that other 50% is just exposed to kind of the current trends?","Juan Luciano","They\u2019ll be David. Yes, when we hedged an asset under 50%. So when we hedge obviously is because we thought that those margins were appropriate to and were attractive to be hedged. And we expect the rest of the Q4 to be, as I said before, a little bit lower than Q3. Margins have recovered some, but they are not of the same quality of early in Q3.","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi Research","A question here on oil prices and ethanol. The volatility on oil has been significant, and it has changed the complexion of ethanol. Is there anything that you can do to hedge the risk of a significant oil price decline? I mean there is a number of banks that are calling for a potentially significant decline in oil mid-part of 2015. And I am just wondering if this is a risk that it could at least \u2013 can you guys hedge that to some degree to prevent any really bad scenarios from transpiring within ethanol?","Juan Luciano","Obviously the thing is, it\u2019s working very hard in scenario management and devising of options going forward. Brent, which is the big driver for our exports, if you will, is still at $82, and $82 ethanol still does very well. So we have still not at that point, but certainly we always do scenario management for much lower oil prices. So too early to tell what we can do, but we are developing options, yes.","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi Research","All right. Two final follow-ups on this one. So if ethanol is doing so well in its comparison to gasoline, why don\u2019t you have a more optimistic forecast on 2015 ethanol exports? And I don\u2019t mean this too critically. I mean quite frankly, I puzzle over this myself, why is it the export forecasts stronger given ethanol\u2019s comparison to gasoline. Why isn\u2019t the ethanol industry at large, not just ADM, why aren\u2019t we seeing just like significant expansions so we get to kind of max capacity in play with the residual being exported?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I think developing export markets take time. Sometimes people also \u2013 customers want to make sure that they have security of supply before incorporating or changing their formulas. So we see the growth David. And if you heard my comments, I referred to $800 million to $1 billion. This year we\u2019re going to be $800 million. So we are thinking about maybe 25% increase from next year, which is not un-significant.","So obviously I would like to see it $1.5 billion and we will drive to try to do that. But we think that it continues to climb, and it\u2019s \u2013 the U.S. becomes a more regular and reliable supplier of global markets. So at this oil prices, we continue to see export growing, let\u2019s put it that way.","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi Research","If I could sneak a final question in on the transport side, because you have the barge network and you own so much rail, can you guys just answer directly, are rail bottlenecks fundamentally positive or negative for ADM? I feel like depending on which part of your business I look at, I can almost come out to any answer. So I think we need some guidance from you on saying if this winner is just a mess, does ADM come out a winner because you guys just have this amazing transportation network in the United States, and that net-net turns out positive for you. Is that reasonable, or is that just the wrong way to think about it?","Juan Luciano","I think the way we\u2019d like to think about it is the net positive for our customers, because they would always get supplied. And I think that overall it\u2019s a competitive advantage of ADM. So I would say relatively to others, I think it\u2019s a positive.","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi Research","Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it along.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Hi there. I wanted to ask about your Analyst Day. And I think the last time we met, Pat, I think you were talking more optimistically or at least looking ahead at possibly giving a bottom range of earnings guidance, kind of like some way of looking at \u201815 earnings in new terms, maybe at least $3 or at least some number. I want to know if you\u2019re still thinking about that as a way of giving guidance going forward. And also I think you were really thinking about the ethanol business as being a much more predictable type of business, more stable, now that capacity has kind of leveled off and corn is cheap. So what\u2019s happened in the oil markets changed your thinking at all on the predictability of corn processing, and then how you would communicate to the street? Thanks.","Pat Woertz","Yes, maybe starting with the later, Rob, and then to your first question. On ethanol business, I think we still believe and do believe that there is more stability, albeit some volatility expected in the future. And the stability comes from the strength of the behavior in the market where producers are, sort of a balance of supply and demand, and that exports continue as, Juan described a moment ago, exports do continue to grow. And the competitiveness of ethanol with Alkylat, [indiscernible] MTBE, the whole laundry list of oxygen components that ethanol truly is the most economically competitive.","So while one of the scenarios that people push of, what are the puts and takes here or what are the bear case or bull case, crude oil prices have been somewhat stable in that $100 range for four years. So kind of the scenario of generally more stable oil prices was a much more stable ethanol environment. I think the fact that oil prices are more volatile maybe than anyone predicted just several months ago, does mean there is more scenario planning here, but I think the option for ethanol business to be more stable this year than last, next year than this etcetera, still stands because of the supply and demand situation.","Your question about our opportunities to describe a little more in detail on Investor Day some of our outlooks. We are very encouraged about 2015 relative to recent years, so we\u2019ll look probably at that time on some of the drivers on 2015 and the strengths, and sort of again the puts and takes, the improvements we\u2019re making in the business and the categories that Juan talked about, whether it be improvement in the business, the portfolio changes and the investments to grow. So I think stay tuned for our Investor Day to have more outlook on that.","Capital allocation and resource allocation will be another thing. We\u2019ll try to put a little more meat on the bones because were just in the process of looking forward for our business plans as we speak.","Robert Moskow \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. A follow-up. I\u2019m still little unclear on sweeteners and starches and how it reported such a good quarter based on mix. What part of the mix are you emphasizing? Is it the starches specifically? And I think Ken already asked this question, but can we point again to another strong fourth quarter as this mix effort continues?","Juan Luciano","Rob, no, I think it\u2019s more on the alternative sweeteners, other sweeteners like corn syrups or dextrose or things like that. And listen, it doesn\u2019t take much because we have swing capacity with ethanol and we have swing capacity with other 20-something products. So what we do is to manage all that and also our customer base to optimize the whole business.","So but I think fundamentally what\u2019s probably happening is that demand was a little bit stronger than probably everybody anticipated in this quarter, both domestically and on exports. So when we see at Q4, although the strength of sweeteners and starches as a business will continue, we see a little bit lower volumes from normal seasonality perspective as we grow into the winter.","Robert Moskow \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. Thank you so much.","Juan Luciano","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning everyone. A little bit of a longer term question given the performance in 3Q, the outlook for pretty strong kind of market environment in 4Q in entering 2015, trying to think about the areas of the business where the returns have really not recovered yet. And I would imagine, Ag Services would be in that bucket, but some good confidence that inflects in 2015. Clearly ethanol has gotten better this year. Asia is probably been challenged with Wilmar with oilseeds crush in China, but maybe walk us through the parts of the portfolio where you the see the most opportunity for returns improvement going forward, maybe outside of kind of the core U.S. merchandizing piece to think about opportunities for earnings growth in \u201815 and beyond?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Adam, Juan here. Listen, if I have to rank what is the biggest opportunity for improvement in returns, it\u2019s probably related to our participation in South America through oilseeds. This year has been very poor in terms of farmers selling and our earnings had been subdued there because of that.","So we don\u2019t expect that to repeat every year, and we think that that\u2019s an opportunity ahead of us for improvement. As we described, Ag Services, I think we see that given the high operating environment, they\u2019re going to face. And I would say the other businesses that we have publicly said that we trying to recover, is the cocoa business, which is a business that we are very hard to improve returns after the divestiture of chocolate.","So those are probably the two areas that could see a more significant improvement next year, or in years to come.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And on the point on South America on the farmers selling, is that something where you see the opportunity is really beginning in 4Q, or you think this is really going to be not till the next crop comes in before the opportunities reemerge?","Juan Luciano","I think \u2013 personally I think it\u2019s more Q1 phenomenon than Q4.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a question for Ray on some of the growth investments. I know you started \u2013 you kind of listed through them quickly on the Slide 12, but help us think about the amount of capital that\u2019s going \u2013 that\u2019s employed on some of these growth projects that starts to come into \u2013 that starts running a return in \u201815 and how much is left to earn in \u201816?","Ray Young","Yes, lot of the \u2013 when we talk about the $0.9 billion in CapEx for this calendar year, a lot of it actually incorporates many of these investments, for example our China investments. We\u2019re close to completion of that. That\u2019s built into our capital budget, some of the premix investments. And the Brazil investments are going to spread out over a couple of years. So generally the way you look at it is that through really a very good capital discipline in reducing the amount of, let\u2019s say, capital being spent on say maintenance activity, we may able to redeploy a lot of this stuff into growth.","So going forward in order to finance this stuff, there was probably going to be increase in terms of the amount of CapEx that we would have, but it\u2019s not going to be materially relative to our depreciation and amortization rates.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe just a last quick from me. The Q4 thoughts on working capital, I mean obviously very large harvest, I\u2019d imagine the volume opportunities in the U.S. are sizable. How should we think about the cash used for working capital in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Ray Young","You should expect an increase in terms of the use of working capital, but again, prices have come down generally compared to last year. And hence therefore, the net increase in terms of dollar value terms is not going to that dramatic. And based upon the balance sheet that we have that will be easily financeable.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs","All right, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Good morning.","Pat Woertz","Good morning, Diane.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, Diane.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","So I wanted to ask about basis opportunities. I think you touched on it with regard to some of the freight issues that we\u2019ve seen. I guess I look at corn prices today and they are a little bit higher than I would have thought they should be given the size of the crop, and I think obviously the lateness of the crop and maybe some of the freight issues that are baked into that price. So I guess my question is really not speaking directly to your rail hedges or whatever, but just your ability to sort of source material in the upper Midwest and maybe a market environment where flow of the product isn\u2019t as seamless as some of the end-users would like it to be. Can you talk a little bit about how you would be positioned in that kind of market given your asset base?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Diane, listen. Obviously, we\u2019ve been looking at that for a long time, and we have been preparing for these tight rail environment. So I think the guys have been doing an incredible work of sourcing product from all the locations. We feel very good going into this harvest. We feel we are executing very well at this point in time. Transportation is working very, very close with the businesses, both the grain business and the corn and soybean business.","So that\u2019s where we do and that\u2019s where the team excel at when there are these difficulties. So I think that you could be assured that we will, in that sense, maximize the basis opportunities and we will continue to keep our customers and our plants supplied. So we have not had \u2013 we were reflecting yesterday that these transportation questions started to fill a little bit like the Ukraine question that everybody is expecting something to happen, and for us has been normal so far.","And for us, we cannot report any issues that have impacted our earnings because of transportation issues so far. Are they going to become worse coming out? Yes, probably. The weather is going to become worse as we get into the winter and think they are going to become more complicated. But it\u2019s hard to point out at this point in time in Q3 and maybe so far in Q4 any issue that we have had related to that.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Well, I guess what was behind my question is really it could potentially be a big benefit for you if you\u2019re able to source the material and store it in light of bottlenecks within the transportation system depending on how desperate farmers are to sell at today\u2019s price. I haven\u2019t noted the level of desperation for farmers to sell with corn below $4, but obviously you are speaking to them more frequently than I am. So if you could maybe talk about the mood amongst the farmers to market in this kind of environment?","Juan Luciano","I think as you described, it hasn\u2019t been the desperation selling at this point in time. So we continue to be very close to them and continue to have our assets ready to take advantage of this location, that\u2019s what we do. At this point in time, obviously there is a big accumulation of grain in the interior and there is a big need for grains sometimes at the export terminals and the ability to transport that is what we possess. So I think there are many opportunities ahead of us in Q4. That\u2019s why we are positive about.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Okay. And then I just also wanted to ask about the expanded JV in the Northwest. Could you talk a little bit about what\u2019s included now in your asset network there, and what you have in terms of capacity for exports out of the Pacific Northwest with the expanded JV?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I don\u2019t remember the actual capacities, Diane. We used to have 50% of the Kalama and now K5 has been incorporated into that. And now with that we have share of about 32%, although still the same management rights that we had before. So with that, we basically have expanded our ability to source from two different ports, if you will. I just don\u2019t remember on top off my head the capacities and we can get you that if you are interested.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Okay, well I guess the question is, with the expansion in your [Technical Difficulty] is that signal to us that you\u2019re going to be adding assets in that area?","Juan Luciano","Not at this point, no.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Okay.","Juan Luciano","This was more like an optimization plan, if you will, Diane, than to decide to expand.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Okay, terrific. Thank you.","Juan Luciano","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Eric Larson \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Thank you. I snuck in just before the bell here. A couple of questions. First one is for Juan. Juan, you have certainly made some improvement in the international merchandizing business like you said, you were going to when you ran into the ADM specific problems several quarters ago. In your terms, how far have you recovered on that? Have you gotten back 50% of the goal line there, or how would you characterize the recovery in that business from a timing point of view?","Juan Luciano","Yes, you recall correctly. We highlighted that at one point in time, and I\u2019m very proud of the team. The team took ownership of the problems and we made significant changes in the cost position, in the way we operate, in the way we commercialize to be honest as well. I would say, if I have to say from 0% to 100%, we are probably 70% of what we wanted to achieve.","Eric Larson \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay. And so when you look at the third quarter of merchandizing profits of $64 million of your EBIT, can you give us a flavor for kind of the domestic\/international component of that number?","Juan Luciano","I don\u2019t have it top off my head, Eric, but I think what we highlighted was the improvement was significant versus same quarter last year in international merchandizing. Domestic grain continues to be a very large business for us when you compare to international merchandizing. So well, we can give you the breakdown, I just don\u2019t remember.","Eric Larson \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay. And would places like the Ukraine structurally be having difficulties? Despite the specific ADM issues, are there regions like the Ukraine that would have a negative delta year-over-year in the most recent quarter or two?","Juan Luciano","No, actually we\u2019re thinking that in Eastern Europe with the good crops, we will see a big opportunity for us to utilize our even recent investments even more. So we are actually very bullish about international merchandizing opportunities in Eastern Europe.","Eric Larson \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay. Then quickly, my next question is for Ray. Ray \u2013 and I really want to drill down on the return on invested capital component. You\u2019re now 210 basis points above your current WACC, a good 50 basis points above kind of your long-term goals. When I look at that number, if you look at the last four quarters, you\u2019ve obviously made good sequential quarterly improvement, but arguably you are not where \u2013 those last four quarters on average certainly aren\u2019t anywhere near what you think you can probably do. And then your laundry list of moving assets and buying assets and selling, I mean your focus on ROIC has been phenomenal. And then you\u2019ve got your $400 million SG&A savings, and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s an absolute number that will be in your 2014. I think that $400 million is a run rate number, correct? And so when I look at the snap up in ROIC potentially in 2015, if markets continue to improve etcetera, I mean why couldn\u2019t you be above or at or close to or above your 10% 200 basis points above your long-term average in a relatively short period of time?","Ray Young","Well, first of all Eric, I think we\u2019re very encouraged in terms of the trends that we\u2019re showing in terms of ROIC. And you\u2019re right, the $400 million in cost savings, which by the way, that\u2019s more of a cost of goods sold, type of savings. And that\u2019s relative to the cost base as of January 1, 2013. So we\u2019ve been working that over a two-year period. But yes, I mean that\u2019s going to help us in terms of improving returns in the future as well. We\u2019re adjusting our portfolio. And so therefore, we are divesting businesses which have low returns and investing in businesses that eventually will generate good returns.","And just to remind you, WILD Flavors, it\u2019s going to take us some time in order to get up to the returns that we talked about. And so therefore I think we are encouraged. There is no doubt that we are in a positive trend in terms of returns. Our objective clearly is to earn the long-term WACC of 8% plus 200 basis points. Whether we get there next year, needs to be determined. There are headwinds, as many of you folks on the phone call have also pointed out regarding crude oil prices and where that in impact on ethanol. I mean there is some headwinds there, but we\u2019re also very encouraged about the tailwinds that we\u2019re also getting in our business, namely the fact that we\u2019re going to have a very good U.S. harvest that\u2019s going to help Ag Services particularly next year.","Eric Larson \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay. And then finally, and then I\u2019ll go back in queue or you\u2019ll end the call. But the month of October with grain prices, it\u2019s very rare to see that kind of a bull rally into the harvest like we have seen it, producers \u2013 Christmas came early for the producers here. And when I look at last week, just penciling in rough numbers. I think last week was the single largest grain production week ever in the United States, just by running some numbers here. And does that potentially still give you going forward now month of November \u2013 I think in the next two weeks in November are going to be pretty interesting. Does that give you potentially more basis opportunity for the fourth quarter \u2013 well, and not just sort of just the fourth quarter, but I mean it would carryover go maybe to spread out for the quarters in 2015 as well, but is there a near-term opportunity here that is encouraging to you?","Ray Young","Yes, it is. Yes, we see it.","Eric Larson \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s what all I expected for an answer. Thank you everyone.","Pat Woertz","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much for taking my question. Pat, I just wondered if you had an update on sort of higher ethanol blend rates. It really hasn\u2019t come up very much in a while either sort of on these calls or in the press, and I recall EPA was supposed to be working on cars older than 2001 for approval. And I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s still a focus or where that is?","Pat Woertz","Right. There is no update that I have for you today or that we have. With the elections too, there is not many topics that are on the minds in Washington other than these current elections. So I have not anything today.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.

Finally, they will take your questions.","Please turn to slide three. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today.","This morning we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.61. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million. For the calendar year, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.60. Global dynamics reduced margins across the U.S. agricultural export sector, the U.S. ethanol industry, and in the soybean crushing industry worldwide. Adverse market conditions that impacted many of our businesses earlier in the year continued through the fourth quarter. Despite the challenging conditions, we achieved 2015 adjusted ROIC of 7.3%, 70 basis points above our annual cost of capital, generating positive EVA.","In the fourth quarter, we advanced our strategic plan by expanding our international corn processing footprint with the acquisition of Eaststarch, progressing our destination marketing strategy with the announcement of the Medsofts Egyptian joint venture, and strengthening our European Olenex refined oils joint venture. And today, we are announcing an investment in a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO, organic, and gluten-free ingredients. From a portfolio management perspective, we completed the sale of our global cocoa business.","In addition, 2015 was the safest year in the history of ADM with the lowest level of recordable and lost-time injuries. I'm pleased with how our discipline, focus, and process improvements have translated to these safety results in 2015.","With current headwinds likely to persist, we remain focused on the areas within our control. We will continue to implement our pipeline of operational excellence initiatives, with an objective of an incremental $275 million of run-rate savings by the end of the calendar year. As part of the evolution of our strategic plan, we are also taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio, seeking innovative ways to lighten-up and redeploy capital in our efforts to drive long-term returns.","In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority, including a quarterly dividend rate increase of more than 7% to $0.30 per share, and share repurchases of between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, subject to strategic capital requirements. With a strong balance sheet, we will also remain opportunistic for investments, especially bolt-ons, in this more challenged macro environment. I'll provide more detail on our 2015 accomplishments as well as perspectives on 2016 later in the call.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Juan. Slide four provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.61, down 39% from the $1 last year. We've been busy this quarter as we continued to manage our portfolio to drive returns which has resulted in a larger-than-usual number of specified items. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million, down $529 million.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 2%, compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our reported tax rate was negative this quarter due to the low tax rates on the gains related to the cocoa and the Eaststarch transactions, together with a one-time favorable $66 million valuation allowance impact. If we excluded specified items, the related tax impacts and the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for the calendar year was approximately 27% in 2015, in line with 2014. The rate has been slightly lower than the recent historical tax rates due to a more favorable geographic mix this year and some favorable discrete tax items this year. For 2016, I would expect our tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range.","Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC of 7.3% is down 170 basis points from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 7.3% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 but below our long-term WACC of 8.0% as reflected in the graph on slide 20 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. In the fourth quarter, we did create value based upon our trailing four quarter average EVA, which was positive $173 million.","On charts 18 and 19 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.61. For this quarter, we had gains on sales and revaluations of assets amounting to $0.70 per share, primarily related to the cocoa transaction and Eaststarch.","We had charges related to impairments, restructuring, and settlements amounting to $0.24 per share, the largest being related to our Brazilian sugar operations. We also made an adjustment to Q4 adjusted earnings to reflect the reallocation of the biodiesel credits to the previous quarters when shipped of about $0.05 per share. And there were two tax adjustments in the fourth quarter, the valuation allowance impact of $0.11 per share that I mentioned earlier, and the true-up of the quarterly tax rates to the calendar year adjusted rate of $0.03 per share.","Slide five provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results.","In the Corn Processing segment, we had a $185 million gain on the revaluation of the company's previously held investment in Eaststarch, our former European joint venture with Tate & Lyle in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest. This transaction closed in early November. We also recorded impairment and restructuring charges of $102 million primarily related to our Brazilian sugar operations. In Oilseeds, we recorded $206 million of gains on sales of assets primarily related to the sale of our global cocoa business. We also had impairment and restructuring charges of $34 million for various underperforming businesses within the segment.","In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring we affected earlier this year. Unallocated corporate costs of $89 million were lower than the run rate for previous quarters due to favorable foreign exchange translation, favorable people-related costs, and some timing effects in 2015 spend, offset partially by higher project costs.","I'd also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter of $16.4 billion were down significantly from last year, driven by large declines in commodity prices and foreign exchange translation. But these factors also favorably impacted our cost of goods sold as our input costs were lower.","Turning to the cash flow statement on slide six, we generated $2 billion from operations before working capital changes, lower than the prior year. Total capital spending for the year was $1.1 billion, up from the prior year's $900 million, but in the lower end of our $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion capital spending guidance we provided earlier in the year. Given the more challenging business conditions we encountered in 2015, we're even more prudent in our capital spending.","We made acquisitions totaling $0.5 billion in 2015 which included AOR, the European bottled oil company; Eatem Foods; and our remaining interest in a Romanian Port; and also Eaststarch. The other investing activities line of the cash flow statement mainly reflects the proceeds from divestitures such as our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, and the sale of our 50% stake in our port in Northern Brazil, less the incremental investments we made in the Wilmar, or approximately $1.5 billion of net divestment proceeds.","During the year we spent about $2 billion to repurchase shares, finishing up at the high end of our $1.5 billion to $2 billion target. Our average share count for the year was 621 million diluted shares outstanding, down 35 million from the time one year ago. At the end of the year, we had approximately 601 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Our total return of capital to shareholders including dividends of almost $700 million was more than $2.7 billion for 2015.","When I think about our capital allocation framework for 2015, if we take our operating cash flows before working capital plus the net divestment proceeds or approximately $3.6 billion in total cash flows, we spent about 30% of that amount on capital spending, and returned about 75% of that amount to shareholders. This is in line with the capital allocation targets, with a bit more tilted towards capital returns to shareholders in 2015.","Slide seven shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our operating working capital of $7.1 billion was down $700 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was about $5.9 billion resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $4.5 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $4 billion in part reflecting the issuance this year of \u20ac1.1 billion of euro debt, or about $1.2 billion in U.S. dollar terms, and the subsequent repurchase of about $900 million of U.S. debt.","Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 20%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year due to the shareholder capital returns in excess of net income by $900 million and the cumulative translation account, which was down about $800 million due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6 billion in available global credit capacity at end of December. If you add the available cash, we had access to $7.3 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ray.","Please turn to slide eight. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. Operating conditions in the fourth quarter deteriorated from the already challenging conditions we faced earlier in 2015. After last year's large harvest around the world and with a strong U.S. dollar, a lack of dislocations significantly reduced U.S. exports and limited merchandising opportunities in ag services. In December, we saw further downward pressure on global soybean crush margins as a result of our Argentine government policies. Also, the dramatic declines in crude oil prices impacted ethanol margins. As a result, full-year segment operating profit was down nearly 21%.","Now, I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional details. Starting on slide nine, in the fourth quarter, Ag Services results were down significantly compared to last year's very strong fourth quarter where we handled record volumes and had record exports from the large 2014 U.S. harvest. In merchandising and handling, despite the large U.S. crop, low commodity prices limited grain movements resulting in fewer merchandising opportunities.","In addition, a strong U.S. dollar, along with ample global crop supplies limited U.S. export volumes and margins. For perspective, Ag Services U.S. export volumes this fourth quarter were down about 20% compared to last year. These declines were partially offset by improved performance and expanded reach at the ADM's Global Trade Desk. For example, in Argentina, we benefited from higher volumes and margins with the changes in the export taxes and the depreciation of the currency.","In transportation, lower U.S. export volumes reduced barge freight rates and volumes. High water levels on the Mississippi River system in the later part of December had some small negative impact on our transportation results for the quarter, but the greater impact will be felt in the first quarter of 2016. Milling and other, again, had another solid quarter. For the year, we generated $684 million of operating profits on an adjusted basis and below our historical levels. There were a number of factors that impacted our results, including a lack of global dislocations and the strong U.S. dollar versus the weakening currencies of other major crop growing areas. This reduced both volumes and margins.","Please turn to slide 10. Corn Processing results declined from the year-ago period. Sweeteners and starches continued to perform well with low input costs and good demand. Results also were impacted by costs related to the ramp-up of commercialization at our plant in Tianjin. Bioproducts results were lower as the steep declines in crude oil prices drove lower ethanol prices. This, combined with continued high industry production levels, progressively reduced industry margins through the quarter. Our ethanol profitability reflects fourth quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon.","In addition, lysine operating profits were challenged by excess global supply resulting in declines in pricing and margins and some production outages in our plant. For the year, sweeteners and starches performed well with solid demand throughout the year in a well-balanced supply demand environment for the industry. On the other hand, lower crude oil prices and high industry production levels created a challenging margin environment for the U.S. ethanol industry. Despite growth in U.S. domestic demand for ethanol brought about by increasing U.S. gasoline consumption.","Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus a very strong quarter one year ago. In crushing and origination we saw decline in global soybean crush margins throughout the quarter as buyers anticipated more competitive South American soybean meal entering well-supplied world markets following the presidential elections in Argentina. Ample global meal supplies, in combination with the strong U.S. dollar, further pressured U.S. meal exports.","Brazilian origination results were lower as grain commercialized earlier in the year compared to the prior year. In addition, the very volatile real exchange rate in the fourth quarter slowed grain movement as well. Refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other was down in the quarter as declining crude oil prices and weaker global demand pressured global biodiesel margins.","Cocoa and other results decreased reflecting the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015. Results from Asia fell from the year ago period due primarily to non-operating charges including Wilmar's Q3 results.","For the year, there was a strong global and U.S. demand for protein. And as a result, our global oilseeds operations set a crushing volume record in 2015. However, with more ample global supplies of meals through the year, in combination with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we saw our soy crush margins begin softening in the third quarter with a more substantial drop in the fourth quarter caused in part by the impact of the Argentine policy changes.","Slide 12, please. In the fourth quarter, WFSI earned $47 million with positive contribution from WILD Flavors, SCI and Eatem Foods. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is generally the weakest quarter of the year for WFSI due to seasonality impacts. This results help offset declines in some of our legacy specialty ingredients businesses, where we saw weaker sales overseas and some forex hedging costs related to our Brazilian specialty protein project.","Since the WILD acquisition, the team has implemented about $40 million in annualized run rate cost synergy. We remain confident that the team will deliver \u20ac100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of 2017. And in its first full year as part of ADM, WILD Flavors contributed $0.10 of earnings accretion to ADM.","Now on slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we are strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at Investor Day in 2014. It lists the actions we were taking to help grow our business and our returns. We have highlighted some of the areas in which we have made significant progress in 2015. I'll discuss a few.","In Ag Services, for example, we've seen the benefits of our Global Trade Desk we created after we acquired Toepfer. We advanced our global ports strategy with actions in Romania and Argentina, and we're growing destination marketing with our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt.","In Corn, we continued our geographic diversification. In Europe, with the Eaststarch acquisition, and in China with the Tianjin sweeteners and soluble fiber plants and with the feed-premix plants.","In Oilseeds, we sold our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, allowing us to improve forward (21:48) returns. We created a joint venture to quadruple the size of our port in Northern Brazil. We acquired the AOR oil bottling business in Belgium. And ADM and Wilmar agreed to turn Olenex into a full-fledged joint venture, helping us to drive additional efficiencies into that business.","And in WFSI, we acquired Eatem Foods, a leading developer of savory flavors having deep expertise in savory flavors and ethnic cuisines.","And this morning, we're announcing that we have reached an agreement to purchase a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO organic and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We'll continue to update you on our scorecard progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the result of these actions in improved earnings and returns.","Now, before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. The global macroeconomic situation has been extremely volatile. We continue to face headwinds related to currencies, crude oil, Argentine policy changes, and a growing supply of commodities.","Barring any material changes to the macro situation, we expect the environment in 2016 to be similar to the second half of 2015. Whatever the conditions, we'll remain focused on driving improvements in the business.","For Ag Services, we expect the strong U.S. dollar to continue through 2016. The large South American harvest that's forecast, would add to already strong global crop supplies, and Argentine exports will be more competitive in the near term following the recent policy changes. All of these present continued challenges for our U.S. export business, though it will support our Argentine export business. We do expect an improvement from Ag Services in 2016, but it's not likely the segment will reach historical operating profit range this year.","For Corn, sweeteners and starches will benefit from the improved pricing environment, the flexibility at our wet mills, solid demand, and low input costs; and Eaststarch will be accretive to earnings.","In ethanol, industry margins remain uncertain with low crude prices and high industry production levels. While we continue our efforts to reduce cost at our corn dry mills, we are now also undertaking a study of the strategic options for them. We do expect overall Corn operating profits to improve from 2015 levels, though this will depend on ethanol industry conditions in the back half of the year.","For Oilseeds, with current global soy crush margin down significantly from 2015 levels, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, and with low crude oil prices impacting global biodiesel margins, we expect 2016 to be lower than 2015. We continue to take actions to improve our Oilseeds operations around the world.","For WFSI, with the robust pipeline, continued realization of synergies, and accretion from recent acquisitions, we expect double-digit percentage growth in operating profit in the 15% to 20% range in 2016. We are pleased that WILD Flavors contributed to results in 2015 despite macroeconomics and forex headwinds.","In this challenging environment, we remain focused on the areas under our control. We continue to execute our strategic plan to grow our earnings power, which will translate into stronger earnings when conditions normalize.","From a cost management perspective, we have made significant progress on our operational excellence initiatives. By the end of 2015, we have achieved more than $200 million of run rate savings. We continue to execute on our pipeline and have set an objective of $275 million in additional run rate savings implemented by the end of 2016.","As part of the continued evolution of our strategic plan, we are taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio. We will be seeking innovative ways to lighten and redeploy capital in our business.","Unlike the billion-dollar challenge launched in 2012 where we look at unlocking value from noncore assets or from restoring (26:53) efficiencies in working capital. Now we're embarking on a multi-year program to examine which assets are underutilized or where the ownership structure could be more efficient, while maintaining an appropriate level of operational control.","In some instances, a partner may be able to help us better utilize the asset. We started this process by selling a 50% interest in our Brazilian port in 2015. We believe we can reduce the asset intensity in various businesses, which will help improve our long-term returns even in a more challenged operating environment. We have set the preliminary target of reducing the invested capital of our businesses by at least $1 billion over time.","In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we have announced a 7% increase in our dividend rate. Our Board recognizes the importance of the dividend to our investors. We also plan to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of shares in 2016 subject to strategic M&A opportunities. We believe the shares are a very attractive investment at current levels.","And through strong cash flow generation, monetization of assets and a strong balance sheet, we continue to look at the strategic growth opportunities. Our priorities are growing our geographic footprint and expanding our Specialty Ingredients business. With our strong balance sheet, we will be looking for opportunistic acquisitions around the world, including bolt-ons with investment decisions driven by a hard look at the returns and inherent risks.","We continue to believe that by executing our strategic and capital plans, we can achieve $1 to $1.50 per share of earnings improvements over the medium term and we're encouraged by the fact that global demand for grains, oilseeds, and proteins remain solid. What we don't know is when the macro and business conditions will improve, returning our earnings base to more normalized levels. And so, we continue to focus on what we can control, to grow earnings and create value for our colleagues, our customers, and our shareholders.","With that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Farha.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Three questions from me, starting with Ag Services. One, last quarter you had highlighted slow farmer selling and noted that there's much of the 2015 crop that still needs to be sold. Could you highlight kind of when you expect that to come to market and how ADM could and when it could benefit from that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me talk a little bit, the North America, Farha, grain movement continues to be slow, behind the pace of last year. Slow prices are not incenting farmers to commercialize their crops yet. So, movements of soybeans was obviously a little bit more brisk maybe in late Q4 and continue into Q1, mainly maybe due to farmer cash flows. We have seen in the past that U.S. stocks will be commercialized through the year, either through a strong demand for U.S. products and cash flow needs for the farmers, or spikes in bulk prices. That's how we're seeing it right out. Right now, we're seeing farmers selling in broad rallies (31:02).","If you go to Brazil or Argentina, we're seeing a strong dependency on what's happening with the currencies. We've seen in Brazil we have a day in which the dollar is BRL 4.18, and we see a lot of farmers selling. If it moves back to BRL 4.11 or BRL 3.97, then we see farmers selling slowing down. We see a little bit of that in Argentina. We saw a little bit more farmer selling of corn and wheat, a little bit less soybeans as the farmer maybe was not that happy with the reduction in export retention that they have over there. So, still, I would say, with these low prices subdued and customers \u2013 farmers will sell through rallies when they have cash flow needs.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Subdued selling. And then, when you work at crushing and origination, you had highlighted that 2016 looks tough. We've seen crush margins continue to deteriorate here in the first quarter. Should we count on any hedges for ADM as we model forward or just think about whatever we see in the crush margin as kind of what we should expect in earnings throughout the year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Maybe let me give you some perspective here. So, in the U.S., we have seen a big deterioration during Q4 and some deterioration also into January. And now, we've seen the industry adjusting operating rates and things starting to ease off from the lows, if you will, that we hit in January.","Obviously, this is the low season in the U.S. anyways. So, there is a shift to crush margins into South America. South America still have an expanded crush margin because they haven't been \u2013 haven't had their benefit of the harvest, but will get that soon in Brazil.","Europe, we see it, okay; kind of stable until maybe March, April, and then we have the dynamics that we'll probably see more exports from South America. But also, we have the rapeseed harvest in Europe and we have the ability to switch our assets a little bit between soybean and rapeseeds over there. So, that's how we see the evolution of crush margins at this point in time.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And finally on ethanol, today you marked a change in your commentary regarding your dry mills. Historically, you thought that they were an integral part of ADM's operations. Can they be run independently given that they're so integrated in ADM? Could you just share with us a time horizon of how you're going to evaluate those assets?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Farha. Yeah. What we're seeing here is that we continue to be implementing our cost reductions in the dry mills that we have seen. But margin continues to be stubbornly low. And even with our improvements in cost, we are concerned about the long-term fundamentals of the dry mill ethanol part of the industry, if you will. So we have asked the team to undertake the strategic review of that. They have an adviser helping them on that. And we're going to run through the different scenarios all the way from one extreme to the other, when we will explore all the scenarios.","So, we have no rush for this. We \u2013 the whole operation is having positive cash flows, positive contributions. So, there's no need to panic. We just want to be prepared to look at the industry long term and see can this industry present the returns that we expect and what are the options to maximize that return for ADM. So there is not a clear timeline or a clear direction. And what we really want to see, we want to see the analysis of the options that the team will bring.","In the meantime, the improvements in cost continue. And we have seen in 2015 improvements in enzymes, improvement in yields, improvement in corn oil recovery. So we are very pleased with what the teams are doing in that. It's just we have an industry problem, and we want to see how we can participate in addressing that through strategic options.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Adam.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Adam.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, maybe first of all on the comments on the capital intensity of the portfolio. I want to dig a little bit deeper there in terms of the targets and opportunity set and understand is that separate from the discussion about the dry mills, first?","And second, parts of the portfolio that you were looking after, is this maybe taking a more rent and lease versus own on your transportation and logistics assets or taking a fresh look at different processing assets for what you want to have full ownership of in the company?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Listen, Adam, if you look at our evolution and our focus on returns, we're very pleased with the pipeline we have in operational excellence. We think we have a very good cost position in the company. We have addressed the portfolio with the divestitures of cocoa, fertilizer and chocolate. We have set up a lot of growth engines through M&A or CapEx projects. The next evolution in this is that we look at the way we operate and we see we are very productive from a people perspective. We made north of $600 million of earning this quarter with 33,000 people, so we feel we're very productive from a people intensity perspective.","When we look at the asset intensity, we don't feel that great about that. We think that there is still some ability to flex our assets a little bit better. Part is the nature of the industry, which is it's got some seasonality and you need to have some assets for some peak periods. But we have started to undergo an analysis of all our businesses and value chain. You have to realize sometimes we keep assets that we think about them as cost centers, if you will. And we are trying to look at them more as businesses in itself and having to provide a return.","So also technology is providing some tools. We have today software \u2013 if I give you an example, ADM because it's a large company, we have many, many warehouses around the U.S. and around the world. Today we have softwares that allow us to look at their freight rates, look at their inventory needs and look at their number of warehouses and can provide a significant optimization to our warehouses network, if you will, that could end up in selling some of those properties.","You mentioned some of the transportation. We do believe we have a very tax efficient ownership of our transportation asset, but there may be aspects of that maybe in ports that where we have opportunity to do something better. So, again, this is a multi-year process and we're going to be looking at several parts of our operations, but we have looked at that with a target of about $1 billion and we believe that these are realistic targets over time in looking at what I just described.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's some helpful color. And then maybe just focusing in on 2016 a little bit and you gave some numbers on cost savings, both the exit run rate in 2015 and what you are targeting to exit 2016 at. I was hoping you could tell us or give us a sense of the year-over-year cost savings that you are assuming in the plan in 2016 versus 2015 as well as the kind of net impact of M&A 2016 versus 2015. There's obviously a number of divestitures as well as some bolt-on M&As scattered throughout the portfolio and maybe a net M&A number would be helpful as we think about kind of the bridge year over year.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. To give you an idea of the operational improvements, when we finished 2015 with $200 million of run rate savings, we approximately realized in 2015 about $90 million of those $200 million, just because the way the projects are implemented during the year.","So as we are talking in 2016 about $275 million in our pipeline that will be executed during 2016 run rate savings of $275 million, we should expect about $100 million, $120 million give or take that will be realized during 2016, if that helps. And I will let Ray talk a little bit about the accretion of some of our M&A.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. But just on the M&A question here, just a couple things. This year, as you know, we actually had a lot in terms of net divestment proceeds from the cocoa and chocolate business. As you know, those businesses were not really generating much profitability to being extremely volatile. We actually believed that and we did some analysis that it actually is going to be positive towards our forward ROICs by divesting those businesses and taking the proceeds and we bought back shares, reduced our invested capital base. So that's going to be actually positive towards our ROIC going forward.","In terms of 2016, you asked what does the M&A divestment kind of look like. I mean, generally as you expect, I mean, we are budgeting or planning CapEx around $1 billion for 2016. On the M&A front, we always have a little bit in terms of just bolt-on acquisitions probably $200 million. Net divestment proceeds; divestitures, we've achieved a lot already in terms of divestitures, and so at this point in time we're not planning for a large divestiture number there. But in general, when I think about the impact of our recent M&As that we did in 2015 as an example, we did quite a few bolt-ons, including Eaststarch. Those have been accretive and will continue to be accretive to our earnings going forward. It's part of our bridge towards $1.00 to $1.50 of improvements. And if you recall, these types of strategic projects over a three-year period will add probably around $0.30 a share towards our earnings power over a three-year period when you kind of accumulate what we've already announced plus some of the projects that we're working on right now.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And just to be clear there, I was kind of really targeting on the net earnings impact of the M&A actions, both sale and purchase in 2015 and what year-over-year benefit or headwind that represents to 2016 profit number.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. When you take a look at it for 2016, approximately on a net basis you probably pick up around $0.05 a share.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you and good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Juan, I wanted to go to one of the \u2013 I think it was the last statement you made in your prepared script. I think you said that over the medium term you expected to see $1.00 to $1.50 in EPS improvements. Should I take that off of this year's base of $2.60, thus you're giving kind of a long-term EPS algorithm of $3.60 to $4.10?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. You heard the second part of my commentary was that really the base had reduced. And the base probably had reduced a little bit more than the $2.60 you described. The $2.60 has already probably between $0.20 and $0.30 of that $1.00 to $1.50 of the new strategy that's bringing. So maybe the base is more like $2.30, $2.40, something in that range. We feel good, as I described before in my comments and I think Ray just mentioned, about the progression towards this $1.00, $1.50. We have a little bit less visibility on when the bases will recover because it's more impacted by macro factors that we really don't control. We control many more of the factors in the strategy.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Understood on that. I have two specific questions: one on ethanol, one on crush margins. So just ethanol, Farha asked it a little bit here, but I am taking it back a little that you'd put these assets up for review right now with oil at $30. What's your view here on this one? What's your view on what kind of oil price do we need for these ethanol assets to make sense?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Remember, when we were talking, I think you asked me this question before when we were at about $50 and we said, at $50 this was going all right. And at $40 we were still doing relatively good. I don't think that \u2013 part is the oil prices, but part is, to be honest, the behavior of the industry. The demand continues to be solid, David. Domestic demand has increased because of low oil prices and high gasoline consumption. And export demand has been very good, and we expect it to be even better to 2016. It's just a matter that the production in the industry has kept this industry margins very, very low, and we are really surprised by that.","We've been running our plants for yield. As I said before, we've seen improvements in our operations based on that. But these margins continues to be stubbornly low, so we want to analyze what happen at lower oil prices, what happen if these things recover. So we have an internal review to see the different scenarios and what do we do under those different scenarios. So it's just a matter that you look at how much can you improve your cost position. We have a good view now into how much we can improve our cost position. And we want to test that against lower oil prices or higher industry rates if they don't go down, so.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Last question for me is just back to soy crush.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","When you look at what's really changed, because margins, I think as a previous caller mentioned, they've really plummeted. But what seems to have changed is the South American currencies. But then maybe if we really zone-in on here, it's Argentina, would you agree that that's been kind of the major change in terms of what's disrupted these markets so much so that we've seen crush margins go from $1.10, $1.20 down to $0.40? Is it Argentina? And then the process here is that as this capacity gets absorbed into the markets, that would be the recovery process in global crush margins?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, David. If you compare last year with this year, last year North America came into the export season with a big book of export on non-traditional destinations, which we didn't have this year. So I think that when I look at Argentina, the farmers selling in soybeans have been disappointing for what everybody was expecting. So crush has improved but not that much, but I think has created the expectation in a lot of the buyers that maybe Argentina will increase crush and will become a bigger player in mill worldwide. And maybe it was wise to wait a little bit and wait for all that to come to market.","Again, it hasn't come yet. If you look at what crushing rate in Argentina is about 3 million tons per month, capacity is maybe 4.5 tons per month or something like that, we're still thinking about 40 million tons of crushing for next year. So we haven't seen the explosion, but I think it has been the psychological impact in all the buyers of non-traditional destination for the U.S.","So we continue to supply the traditional destinations to the U.S. We have lost that ability to sell aggressively to non-traditional destination, partly the U.S. dollar, partly the expectations that Argentina will come into that. So longwinded answer to your question. It's probably yes, although not yet because of increased production, more for psychological impact of their ability to produce more.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I guess two questions. The first one is about the strength of the U.S. dollar and how damaging it's been to your business this year. I've covered the company for a long time and there's been periods where the dollar has been strong before. And it appears that it's having more of an adverse effect this time around than in the past hurting your merchandising programs out of the U.S. Can you explain to me why it's so much worse this time around? And then I had a follow-up about the Argentina situation.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Hey, Rob. A couple observations. There's different currencies that impact us. If you look at just pure translation impact, Rob, over the calendar year, this is a classical accounting translation. Translation impact on our operating profit was about roughly $130 million negative impact for us, okay? So just pure currency translation. So, therefore, it was a impact but I'd say that's not a dramatic impact. The bigger issue is really the competitive issue and the competitiveness issue is really driven by not just the strength of the U.S. dollar but also the fact that two other factors: we've got large crops around the world, all right. So the fact that you've got well-supplied inventories of crops around the world had an impact; and then secondly, for the major crop-growing areas, their currencies actually devalued far more than what the basket of currencies that the U.S. dollar is weighed against.","So when you saw what happened this year, you saw the reais because of the political situation really depreciate, you saw the Argentine policy changes, you've seen what happened with Russia and Ukraine. So what happened was for the major crop-growing areas, their currencies actually devalued significantly relative to the basket of currencies. And then you also anticipate lot of supply around the world because under normal situations, Rob, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, let's say, under a normal cycle of U.S. dollar strength and when there's a more balanced supply of crops around the world, the world will still come to the U.S. for the crops.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, in my mind, that's what really changed this year. And I don't believe this is structural. This is temporary. We're going to go through this cycle here. I do believe at some juncture the U.S. dollar will correct itself. Timing to be determined, but I don't think this is a structural issue. It's a cyclical issue that we're going to have to manage through here.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. And then that leads to the next question is the inventory situation. Like, do you have a sense of how long it's going to take for all that excess inventory in Argentina to move through? It sounded like the farmers aren't that eager to sell. They're kind of being more opportunistic. So what do you think?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I think it's not going to be an immediate flush of all those soybeans. Obviously, Argentina will try to consume those soybeans as much as possible through crushing. So I think it could take a big part of 2016, almost all 2016 to do that. If you think that they have, take your pick, between 12 million tons, something in that range, and again if the delta between what they crush, 3 million tons per month and there is capacity of 4.5 million tons per month and the farmer are not that interested in selling, the situation is not going to change that much in Argentina in the short term. So I think it's going to be a gradual period in which we might have to suffer with increase in North America, suffer with increased crush margins from Argentina for a while until they evacuate all this inventory.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. So this is the bigger issue, above and beyond the U.S. dollar getting strong, is just the oversupply situation?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ken.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So a couple questions. One is, is there any interest for you guys to buy or bid on the ports in Brazil that are being privatized? Is that something that interests you in terms of trying to diversify and be able to capitalize on the South American markets?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Ken, ports are important in Brazil, as you will know. One of the reasons we are expanding our terminal in Santos and we created this port in the northern part of Brazil. We have to be careful, though, that there is a lot of port capacity being created. And as we see it in North America, in order for you to get good elevation in margins, there needs to be some tightening of that capacity; it continues to be a supply-demand game.","So, yes, we're evaluating \u2013 our teams are evaluating. But we need to make sure that we look at the potential for overbuilding in certain areas. So we continue to be with our focus on returns and looking at that. We're building a port in Argentina in San Lorenzo because we think it makes sense. We built a port in the northern part of Brazil. We thought it made a lot of sense. The other ports we continue to analyze. There is a lot of activity. In some places, maybe even too much activity.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. The second question is what do you think is the path for ethanol margins to recover? Like, what are we looking for? Do we need just oil prices to be better","or would it be better if the industry just entered into such extreme losses that there'd have to be production cuts? And just following up on that, what is the outlook for ethanol exports, call it, Mexico, India and China?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So, the first part is, I think there are two ways at this point in time to improve ethanol margins. One is expand export markets. I think we know what the domestic market will be, so is expanding export market, thankfully.","And the second is probably cut in rates domestically. And I think that as people, we are seeing it ourselves. When we ran these things for yield, our cost position becomes better. So when you have thin margins, you want to be able to have your lowest-cost position, your best cost position. And it's not necessarily through volume that you get that. And we have proven that that in our own facilities. But anyway \u2013 so, those are the two main factors.","In terms of growing exports, we do see places like India and China that are dealing with environmental issues due to smog that \u2013 how they are increasing the use of ethanol to fight their environmental \u2013 their air issue \u2013 air pollution issue.","So, we see that demand growing. We see how demands have grown in China, and we expect for next year to be even bigger. So we expect 2016 net exports from the U.S. to be probably between 50 million gallons to 100 million gallons higher than what they were in 2015 driven by all these two main markets.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, if that's the case, then why wouldn't ethanol margins in a year from now or two years from now be at a 10% return on invested capital business?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, Ken, if you have asked me last year with the volumes of this year, I would have guessed that margins will be better. And yet, we continue to still only run at high rates, and maybe people bringing \u2013 creeping their plants and producing as much as they can. So, this is a commodity industry and you really need very, very tight capacity utilization. So maybe, low-90%s doesn't make it. You need to be like 96%, 97% on that. And if every time that we get to that level somebody brings a little bit more capacity, we continue to hover in this level that doesn't benefit anybody.","So to me \u2013 I mean, we continue to be optimistic as we were before. We continue to improve our operations. It's just that at one point reality needs to match our optimism. And so far, it hasn't done it.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Just a follow-up on your comment that ethanol exports will likely increase this year. I was wondering what type of crude oil price is embedded into your assumption, because despite ethanol's discount to other octane enhancers, it seems that exports could be challenged to rise if crude prices remain at current levels.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. At this point, we are forecasting this type of level if you will. $30, if you will, in the absence of any more information than that in a very volatile environment. We still believe that, as I said, there from an alkaloids perspective, and as you said from some oxygenates, we're still cheaper and we still see continued demand from our destinations.","We see, as I was answering to Ken, gladly that there are new markets like, again, India and China that are increasingly taking based on air pollution issues and the benefit of ethanol to do that. So, at this point, we are estimating on a flat crude oil environment if you will.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then on WFSI, could you discuss the pipeline? And has the current economic environment done anything to push back your longer term targets for the segment?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say 2015 was kind of a noisy year or a dirty year for WFSI. We integrated the acquisition. We put several businesses together. We have a couple of bolt-ons and then we have emerging market issues that move our demand. And even our seasonal high periods, they move a little bit. So, it was a very unusual year. With also a lot of customers focusing much more sometimes in cost reductions than in revenue enhancement opportunities. We are very pleased though with the way the customers have reacted to our value proposition and we see that in the engagement that we have in our customers.","So, our expectations for the pipeline and the deliverance of synergy have not changed. Maybe it has changed a little bit the composition of that in the short term. I think, if we're going to be talking in the year three of this, we'd probably be reporting a little bit higher cost synergies than we originally expected, and we will still be targeting the same amount or more of revenue synergies, maybe a little bit longer in the timeline, just because we continue to incorporate products to our product line and our value proposition, and that continues to open doors with customers.","But the customer projects are normally a little bit slower or less in our control from a timing perspective than the cost synergies. But the response to customers to our value proposition has been very, very good. We've \u2013 when we originally target this, Sandy, we had $94 million originally target on revenue synergies; we have built a pipeline of already $67 million to $70 million, and we have more than 700 projects in the pipeline. So, we feel very, very good about having created this pipeline that we're turning into execution and into wins, and you will see that accelerating in 2016.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","It's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ann.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Most of my questions have been answered, but I'd like to just take a step back to the currency discussion. If currencies remain about where they are today, could we see additional downside pressure around the world just from places like South America, Eastern Europe, all the various countries that are concerned about deflation of their own currencies just planting more crops just because they need to get their hands on dollars versus the world needing more crops? So, I guess my question is, could things get worse before they get better if currencies remain as is?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, as you know, Ann, I mean, it's difficult to forecast currencies, right. I mean, it's \u2013 there's a lot of factors that enter it. There's the political factors also impacting presumably the Brazilian currency at this point in time. I mean, you also have to remember that in some respects, a lot of these countries are getting a windfall right now in terms of the competitiveness of the crop because they've got the devaluation that occurred this year, yet your input cost was prior to the currencies devaluing. So, they were able to still get competitive input costs in terms of whether it'd be seed or chemicals, I mean, that's going to change as you go into 2016 because what will happen is they'll have to buy that at a higher cost, because lot of this is actually denominated more in U.S. dollar terms.","And so, a lot of these countries are going to have to grapple with higher input costs in terms of their grains going forward, whether it be seeds, chemicals, et cetera, et cetera, so what to see? I mean, is the worst behind us? It's difficult to predict. What we do know is currencies go through cycles. And so, from our perspective, we're going through a cyclical downturn with some of these currencies. Political influences have some impact, our job is just to manage this, and we'll continue to focus on expanding our footprint in South America as for example. I mean, we've made investments down there and we're going to continue to manage our costs.","The other factor Ann is, is really balancing the global supply-demand of grains and oftentimes, that low prices solve a lot of issues. And so, with the current low prices, expectation is that you should see a lot more consumption around the world and that could probably help us in terms of the global supply-demand balance, which will also be important in terms of getting the situation back to normal.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. And then just one follow-up on ethanol. Could you comment on the Chinese government's latest round of antidumping charges against U.S. DDGs? Is that impacting your business already on the dry-mill side or is that yet to come?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is \u2013 obviously, this is the second time that we're going through this with the Chinese government. And, yeah, there's been more \u2013 there's been less activity, obviously, going of DDGs into China. So, they are staying domestically. And they are adjusting prices to find their way into Russia. So, a little bit hurting soybean mill in that sense. And \u2013 but I will say, yeah, obviously, not a positive for ethanol, but we're seeing the impact already.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to get an update on HFCS pricing to the extent you can talk about that as the negotiations are nearing a conclusion?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Michael. Yeah. As we said, the negotiations have concluded. We are very satisfied, you know the industry is very tight. So, I think, we concluded with pricing across the portfolio of products in the high-single digits, I would say, for 2016. So, we believe that 2016 represent an opportunity for us to expand margins and see an even-increasing volumes for us. So, we are very bullish about that segment for 2016.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. And then you've talked in the past about trying to optimize your grind on the wet milling operations. Would it be fair to assume that, maybe, you're shifting some of that grind away from ethanol towards other products at this point in time? Or how should we sort of think about the amount of swing capacity you have to move away from ethanol given the current market conditions?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. If we \u2013 if you look at, for example, how much ethanol we produced in 2015, we produced less than in 2014. And if you look at high-fructose corn syrup or all our sweeteners and starches, actually we grew our volumes. So, there is a shift that we normally place. The guys optimize the assets and fight for the grind is not only between those two things, but we also continue to introduce new products, sometimes too small to mention, but we continue to see that fight for the grind, yeah.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. And then my last question is, if you could kind of classify within that $275 million bucket of cost savings, roughly how much is going into Corn versus some of the other segments, that'd be helpful. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't know the $275 million top of my head. But traditionally, Corn takes about 50% of all our operational improvements. And that might change, you know, over time as we run out of some opportunities here or there. But I would say a rule of thumb, you take 50%, apply it to ethanol \u2013 to Corn, I'm sorry.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Again, most of my questions have been answered, but I want to actually talk a little bit more about the kind of global supply situation. We're seeing in the U.S. estimates coming out that corn and soybeans will be 174 million acres which is not demonstrably different from what it was last year. So, I think the U.S. banks will probably have more to determine what \u2013 how much farmers get to plant, and that may have an impact on planting numbers. But it doesn't seem like these low prices have at least started to discourage production in the U.S.","And then you've still got about 200 million metric tons sitting in China. They don't know what to do with it, I guess time with China would be that \u2013 with China, they have such poor storage that maybe it all just goes bad, which would be a good scenario. But can you kind of wrap up your thought \u2013 can you wrap up your thoughts on global supply as we put all these factors together, South America, what the U.S. planting season might look like on acreage, what China might do with their corn, we're putting a lot of variables in there, but this is really kind of a key to what I think is going to be a turnaround for your industry fundamentals.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Eric. So, let me take that by pieces. In the U.S., we expect probably acreage of corn and soybeans to go up a little bit and maybe at the expense of wheat acres. You said it well, the globe have increased their stocks this year in the tune of maybe 20 million tons, 25 million tons. So, the world is well supplied. And yet China is sitting on inventories, although we never know the quality of those inventories.","So, at this point in time, given that South America is probably not having any major threatening weather events and the U.S. seems to be forecasting a wet spring and we have good soil moisture. So, we probably expect that there'll continue to be ample supply going into next year. There has been some dislocations. We shouldn't forget, El Ni\u00f1o created some problems and that's why we're exporting so much soybean oil to India, for example, or we are exporting now more corn to South Africa because of the drought there. But probably, these dislocations were regional in nature and didn't get to global levels. So, at this point in time, the scenario is for still plentiful supplies as we see forward.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then just your comment that you're looking kind of at 2016, we should sort of begin our thought process that it might be similar to second half 2015. Obviously those were two pretty difficult quarters and I see exactly where you're coming from on that. What would change it so that you'd look more like the first half of 2015?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Eric, let me take that. I mean, when you take a look at what we've done in the back half of 2015, we've been running $0.60 a quarter, right, in terms of a run rate.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And so, I mean you can't necessarily multiply by four, but what we're saying is that the conditions are not going to be \u2013 at least what we see in terms of just visibility at this point in time, not materially different.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As we kind of move through the year, I mean, clearly, you're going to have certain benefits there. As you would expect, we are going to start off low in the first quarter. I mean, this is based upon the conditions that we end up at the end of December where ethanol margins have ended up. And I mentioned to you, the high water impacts that we had in the Mississippi River that will impact us in January \u2013 in the first quarter. We'll start off slower in the front half of the year. We'll start off slower in first quarter and then we expect some gradual recovery as it kind of move through the year.","We will get accretion from the investments that we've made. We will get accretion from the cost reductions that we're doing. Well, again, as Juan indicated, we expect the margin environment for ethanol should improve as we kind of move through the year but again, that's going to be a variable that we're going to analyze very, very carefully.","And so, as you kind of look at how we think the year will play out, again, as Juan indicated, we do expect Ag Services to be a little better. We expect Corn to be a little bit better. Again, a lot of it a function of where the ethanol margins for the industry end up in the back half of the year. We see Oilseeds is based upon the global crush margins right now to be worse off and then WFSI should have a good year. So, with all those puts and takes, I think we've to make a judgment in terms of how we end up overall. But at least, based upon what we see in terms of visibility, the front \u2013 first quarter front half will be tougher than what we think the second half would look like.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. I think that's a very thorough perspective. Thank you very much for that.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Eric.","Operator","There are no further questions.

Good morning, everyone, thank you all for joining us today.","This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.00 and adjusted segment operating profit of $1.1 billion. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $701 million or $1.08 per share. Segment operating profit was $1.3 billion.","For the calendar year, we achieved adjusted earnings of $3.20 per share, up 37% from last year's $2.33. And importantly, adjusted ROIC of 9% was 260 basis points above our cost of capital.","In the fourth quarter, the Agricultural Services team executed well to capitalize on strong conditions, while international merchandising continued to show year-over-year recovery.","In North America and Europe Oilseeds showed strong year-over-year growth offset by weaker results in South America.","Looking ahead in North America and Europe, solid crush margins and export opportunities have carried into the first quarter. Market conditions in South America Oilseeds should improve with the large harvest, and we are working towards higher returns throughout 2015 in this key geography.","While U.S. ethanol demand was seasonally strong, boosted by the domestic response to lower gasoline prices, high industry production has built excess inventories. Margins in this industry should remain challenged until supplies are better aligned with demand. We will continue our work to optimize cost and product mix in the Corn business to maximize profitability. Also during the fourth quarter, we were busy preparing for the January 1st, launch of the WILD Flavors and the Specialty Ingredients business unit, working on synergies, preparing to move businesses and aligning teams.","In view of our continued strong performance and our positive outlook, our Board of Directors has voted to increase our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28.","Now I will turn the call over to Ray.","Ray Young","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone.","Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.00 a share, up 5% from the $0.95 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $1.1 billion, up $88 million or more than 8% from last year.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the calendar year, our effective tax rate was 28%, lower than last year's 33% tax rate, which was negatively impacted by valuation allowances taken on certain significant deferred tax assets.","Looking into calendar year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC of 9% improved from the 8.5% at the end of the third quarter and also significantly improved by 200 basis points -- 40 basis points from the 6.6% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 9% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.4% annual WACC for 2014 as well as our long-term WACC of 8.0% as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. In the fourth quarter, our trailing four quarter adjusted EVA was $670 million based upon adjusted earnings and annual WACC, up $315 million from 2013.","On Chart 17 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share to the adjusted earnings of $1.00 a share. For this quarter LIFO represented a $16 million pretax credit or $0.01 per share after-tax. We also recorded net gains on sales of assets of about $135 million pretax or $0.14 per share after-tax primarily related to the sales of our South American fertilizer business. We incurred about $33 million of WILD related charges, or about $0.03 per share, related to transaction closing costs as well as restructuring costs during the quarter. We incurred a $98 million non-cash pretax U.S. pension settlement charge related to selling some of our retiree liabilities with lump sums.","In our GAAP statements this charge is included in our SG&A expense line. There were approximately $41 million of pretax impairment charges or $0.04 per share from various assets. And finally, we adjusted our fourth quarter results down by $52 million, or $0.09 per share, for U.S. biodiesel tax benefits attributable to the earlier three quarters. This breaks down as roughly $0.01 a share in Q1, $0.03 a share in Q2 and $0.05 a share in Q3.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan goes into the operating results, I would like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. In Oilseeds, I just talked about the South American fertilizer gain and the other [peer] [ph] benefits of the biodiesel tax credits. We will also continue to have our cocoa and chocolate business as part of our segment reporting results in Oilseeds until which time we have closed on the sales sometime in the first half of 2015. They are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements. There are also various asset impairment charges in all three segments in corporate to sum up to about $41 million pretax.","In the other processing line, we have included the initial results of both WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. There were about $33 million of transaction closing and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. In addition, included in the negative $13 million number in other processing is about $23 million of purchase price amortization charges related to inventories and $3 million of additional depreciation expenses. Excluding these amounts WILD and SDI earned about $13 million in the fourth quarter.","Effective January 1st, the results of WILD and SDI will be included in our new fourth business segment called WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, which also includes certain Specialty Ingredients businesses from our other three segments.","To assist you with your analysis for 2015, we have included in the appendix a pro forma of our 2014 quarterly results adjusted for the ADM business lines that would be part of the fourth business unit. In the corporate lines net interest expense was down due to significantly lower debt levels; unallocated corporate costs were higher due to various special project costs including our ERP project that was initiated earlier in 2014. Other charges for the fourth quarter are primarily related to our $98 million non-cash U.S. pension settlement charge.","In addition, I want to point out the currency translation effects on our earnings, while negative, were not material for the fourth quarter nor for the calendar year as much of our global merchandising and process in trade flows are either U.S. dollar functional or U.S. dollar linked providing some insulation to our financial results against fluctuations of the U.S. dollar or the euro.","I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $20.9 billion, down from last year's $24 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues. But this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key for us managing the spread between revenues and cost of goods sold, which is a core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing ADM.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6, we present here the cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. We generated just over $2.7 billion from operations before working capital changes in the year ended 2014, slightly higher than last year. Working capital changes were a source of $2.3 billion this year compared to a source of $2.9 billion last year.","Total capital spending for that year was about $0.9 billion compared to the prior year \u2013 comparable to the prior year and in line with our reduced CapEx target. We completed acquisitions of $3 billion in equity, which included WILD and SDI, but net of cash assumed amounted to $2.7 billion.","We also received proceeds of divestitures from the South American fertilizer business of $350 million. For 2015, we are estimating capital spending in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is higher than our $0.9 billion spending in 2014, which you may recall we reduced after the WILD acquisition to assess capital spend avoidance opportunities. As a result some 2014 spending shifted into 2015.","We also have some additional spending for our ERP program and cost reduction projects, as well as the ramp-up of our specialty protein project spending in Brazil, our Fibersol project in China and the U.S., our lecithin projects in Germany and India.","In February 2014, our $1.15 billion convertible debt matured, we paid down this debt, contributing to our overall debt reduction. For the year, we spent about $1.2 billion to repurchase about 25 million shares and we paid out $0.6 billion in common dividends. So for the year, we returned about $1.8 billion to shareholders. We ended the year with about 643 million shares on a fully diluted basis.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of the end of both 2014 and 2013. Cash on hand was approximately $1.6 billion, down $1.9 billion from last year. Our operating working capital of $7.8 billion was down $3.1 billion from the year ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1.3 billion related to lower inventory prices and about $0.7 billion related to lower inventory quantities and a decrease of about $1.1 billion in other working capital, primarily related to reclassification of working capital of our global cocoa and chocolate businesses which are treated under held for sell accounting as well as additional trade receivables sold during the calendar year.","Total debt was about $5.7 billion resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $4.1 billion, up slightly from the 2013 net debt level in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash outflows related to the acquisitions of WILD and SDI. Our shareholders equity of $19.6 billion is $0.6 billion lower than the level last year with a cumulative translation account down about $0.9 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6.6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add the available cash, we had access to almost $8 billion of short-term liquidity.","In view of our strong liquidity position and forward outlook, the Board of Directors approved increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.28 per share, a 17% increase. This would translate to an annualized cash outflow of about $0.7 billion. In addition, with a strong balance sheet and forecast generation of cash we expect to repurchase anywhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of ADM's shares, subject to any strategic requirements that may occur over the course of this calendar year. So we expect to return anywhere from $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders this year, again, subject to any strategic requirements.","With a forecast CapEx spend of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2015, we believe we are again providing a balanced approach towards capital allocation consistent with the intentions we outlined on Investor Day in December.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?","Juan Luciano","Thanks, Ray.","Please turn to slide 8. I'll start with segment operating profit and then move on to discuss the three major segments. Our underlying segment operating profit improved sequentially every quarter this year. In the fourth quarter it increased 20% from the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis a significant improvement in our services drove an overall increase of 8%. In all four quarters this year the team delivered year-over-year improvements in segment operating profit.","For the calendar year, we earned $3.7 billion of operating profit excluding specified items, up 25% from the year before. 2014 was another solid year from our Oilseeds business, demonstrating the strength and diversity of the portfolio in delivering consistent results. The Corn business showed the value of managing the business with overall results. In 2014 they delivered their best operating profit ever. And Ag Services demonstrated a strong recovery from the prior year, aided by a turnaround of international merchandising results and good execution by the team to fully capitalize on a more favorable environment. I am very proud of all the team was able to accomplish this year.","Now I will walk you through our fourth quarter results.","Starting on Slide 9, the Oilseeds team delivered a strong quarter. It is worth noting that last year's fourth quarter was exceptionally strong driven by strong performances across all regions. In the fourth quarter good capacity utilization and margins drove strong soybean crushing results in Europe and North America with the North American team delivering an all-time record quarter amid strong global demand and low input costs. Both North American and European crushing results were better than the same period last year.","South American results were down significantly compared to a very strong fourth quarter last year. Origination and transportation were impacted by lower Brazilian corn production, reduced exports and slow farmer selling relative to last year and losses on basis and board crush positions. In Paraguay, a lower quality crop hurt export opportunities. In addition, South American results were negatively impacted by fertilizer as we transition this business for the close of the sale in mid-December.","In Europe overcapacity pressured biodiesel margins. And in North America the retroactive U.S. biodiesel tax credit improved margins on gallons blended in the quarter, though demand was down seasonally. Also our results in Asia were consistent with last year, were much improved compared to the earlier quarters in 2014 driven by Wilmar results.","Please turn to Slide 10. Corn processing results declined in the quarter. In the year ago period sweeteners and starches benefited from a steep decline in net corn costs. This fourth quarter conditions were more challenging as net corn costs rose during the quarter. In addition, our results in this fourth quarter were negatively impacted by hedge losses on co-product sales and increasing bad debt reserves and startup costs related to our new sweetener facility in Tianjin, China.","For the fourth quarter, absent these unique factors, sweeteners and starches results would have been about $100 million. Good execution, the combined management of production and merchandising drove a significant improvement in bioproducts results and animal nutrition results improved on better margins and solid demand.","Slide 11, please. In the fourth quarter, Ag Services results improved significantly from last year when market conditions were challenged following the drought of 2011 and 2012. In the U.S., the team put on a strong soybean export program during harvest moving beans at a record pace. This allowed great throughput to our origination and transportation networks, as you can see reflected in those results. The international merchandising team continued their turnaround.","The fourth quarter was the first quarter in which we coordinated our worldwide trade flows through our new global merchandising desk. I am particularly proud of our international merchandising team's work in 2014 as they integrated the Toepfer trading operation and led an operational and financial turnaround.","In transportation, the strong U.S. bean export program, replenishment of fertilizer and salt inventories, and great river conditions allowing large tows deep thrust combined with great execution to deliver an outstanding performance. And our Midland results were strong as the business saw solid merchandising and blending opportunities in the quarter.","Now on Slide 12, we wanted to briefly update you on our actions that are driving improved returns. We focus, as you know, those efforts in a few areas: strengthening the business; managing our portfolio; and growing the business. In the area of strengthening the business, we exceeded our target of $400 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2014.","During our December Investor Day, we outlined our target for $350 million in further cost savings related to operational excellence and process improvements. We also highlighted $200 million in incremental purchasing savings. So we are targeting a total of $550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next five years.","In the area of managing our portfolio, following the WILD acquisition we are well on our way to achieving our targeted \u20ac100 million in synergies over the next three years. The commercial and technical teams are focused on realizing the benefits of the combined businesses and have had over 100 customer engagements so far. We have already recognized synergy wins within our first three months and are actively building a pipeline of opportunities for new business.","Cost synergy activities are also underway. We are addressing redundancies and eliminating overlapping corporate SG&A. In December, we announced our additional IT center will be located in existing space at WILD's facility in Erlanger, Kentucky.","We reached an agreement in December to sell our global cocoa business to Olam for $1.3 billion. We expect to close that sale in mid-2015. We remain on track to close the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill for $440 million in the first half of 2015. We closed the $350 million sale of our South American fertilizer business in December.","And in an example of the asset-like approach that we have mentioned before, I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement to sell a 50% stake in our export terminal in northern Brazil to Glencore. Combined with a plan to quadruple that facility's capacity, we are strengthening strategically located asset in a cost and capital efficient way. Our efforts to improve returns also involve investing to grow the business.","In November, we began production at our sweetener plant in Tianjin, China. Construction continues on our fiber plant in Tianjin, China, our feed premix plant in Nanjing, China and our specialty protein complex and Campo Grande, Brazil. The expansion of our Fibersol production capacity at Clinton, Iowa is on schedule to be operational midyear. And our non-GMO lecithin projects in Hamburg, Germany and Latur, India should be operational in March and July respectively.","We continue to take actions to further improve the business and, as you can see, that is reflected in our returns.","Before we take your questions I wanted to offer some additional perspectives as we look forward. Our Ag Services result showed how our larger and more efficient U.S. network can perform with a big clock. As the South American harvest continues we will see the seasonal decline in North American soybean exports. We also expect to see corn exports pick up starting with the Pacific Northwest and then moving to the Gulf. Continued North American mill exports should support crush margins well into Q1. And the large South American harvest should drive exports and improve crush margins.","In sweeteners and starches we expect 2015 volumes and margins to be similar to 2014. Ethanol demand should improve in the coming quarter as low gasoline prices and the change in weather should support increased driving miles. And in this margin environment we would expect many producers to run for yield rather than volume which should improve alignment of supply and demand.","Across the Corn business we continue our work to optimize our product and customer mix. In our new WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit, we expect to benefit from new wins and increase customer engagements. We are working to deliver a compelling portfolio of ingredients and services that will allow us to better serve our customers. We are adding geographic scale to our business with capital projects ongoing in China, Brazil, India, Germany and the U.S. And we are expanding the scope of our portfolio by adding the basic healthy ingredients of Specialty Commodities as well as pursuing new products such as texturized protein, non-GMO lecithin and omega-3's.","We expect that many of our businesses that did not perform that well in 2014 will have more favorable results in 2015. South American results should improve. We expect our international merchandising business to continue its improvement. We have disposed of or are disposing of our poorer performing businesses such as South American fertilizer, chocolate and cocoa. And we have a list of other businesses for which we are targeting improve profitability of returns in 2015.","So a strong finish to 2014, good conditions for the year ahead and continued improvements in our portfolio of businesses. Overall, we feel very good about our position for 2015. To recap a few news items we announced on today's call, we are targeting an additional $550 million in run rate cost savings within the next five years. We have agreed to sell 50% of our port facility in northern Brazil to Glencore, and together we will be quadrupling capacity of the port. We are targeting up to $2 billion of stock buybacks for the calendar year and the Board has increased our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28.","With that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Morris with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Evan Morris","Good morning, everyone.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, Evan.","Ray Young","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Morris","I just want to talk a little bit more about ethanol. And obviously fourth quarter came in better than what I was looking for. But your commentary regarding the margins being challenged suggests I guess it is more of a production issue than just a broader environment with lower prices. Can you kind of talk a little bit about that? And if that is the case, how long does the oversupply usually take to correct to come back in line with demand?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Evan, so really we are not seeing a change in demand. Actually if anything it has been an improvement because of reduced gasoline prices that have increased consumption in the United States. We have seen an excess in production that is driven mostly by the very good margins we enjoyed in the November timeframe. So how long will it take for that to correct? Difficult to say. We are going to see a combination as we go into the first quarter of progressively higher driving miles and then some of the refineries getting to maintenance as they go into March as they prepare for the [hydrating] [ph] season.","So we manage, as I said in my prepared remarks, the business for the overall. So we try to manage the overall product mix and we look for what margins are very good we run for volume, when margins are declining we run a little bit more prudently for yield. So that is \u2013 so we see this is a relatively immature industry, but these low margins will correct itself, the supply issue, and we expect increasing margins as we go into the later part of Q1.","Evan Morris","Okay. And just with that and I know ethanol is not a huge part of the business, but it seems to be \u2013 your stock is trading on the exchange in oil prices. But when you talk about margins remaining challenged, I mean that is sort of a pretty ambiguous term. Can you give a little bit more color around that? Are you expecting early on to not make any money in the early part of the quarter? I mean you had really strong operating profit per gallon as you exited the year. So if you could just put a little bit of context around what you mean by challenged, where do you expect margins to kind of settle out more broadly and where do we kind of head as the year progresses?","Juan Luciano","Of course. If you look at the story in Q4, you see the high volatility that are on ethanol prices, so this is very hard to predict with any precision. We continue, Evan, that is why we continue with our efforts on our cost improvements and we highlight that all the time. And you heard me that we have exceeded our stretch goal of $400 million because a big part of that is in the Corn business. The other leg of the stool that we look at is the flexibility and the introduction of new products that allow us to shift production to the products that are growing the most or having less margin pressure. I would say, Evan, overall, we expect probably margins in ethanol to be a little bit lower than 2014, but better than current levels.","Evan Morris","Okay. And just last question for you. Given the operating environment and all the puts and takes, do you think in 2015 that you will be able to hit your medium-term ROIC target of 10%?","Juan Luciano","Well, you know we have the impact of WILD in 2015 that is 0.7%.","Ray Young","About 70 basis points impact.","Juan Luciano","About 70 basis points. So listen, you heard us at the Investor Day. Two years ago we put this strategy based on returns. And as you see in the graph that I showed in my slide, that strategy continues to deliver and we feel very good about that. Obviously every now and then as we have a big acquisition like WILD, we pause a little bit in that trajectory. But all our programs are working and we are very optimistic about our trajectory towards 10%.","Evan Morris","Okay, thank you.","Juan Luciano","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam","Hi, good morning.","Juan Luciano","Hi, Farha.","Ray Young","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam","Looking at crushing and origination, could you just break down that segment a little bit for us? On any given year how much should we expect from North American crush versus South America versus international merchandising, roughly?","Juan Luciano","Well, let's see, international merchandising is reported into Ag Services so let's separate that, Farha, yes.","Farha Aslam","I'm sorry.","Juan Luciano","So certainly North America is much bigger than South America proportionately. I would say \u2013 but you are probably wondering because of the offsetting effect this quarter of the South American result. We have a combination of issues there.","First of all, as you recall, in South America we report also origination efforts. So farmer selling has been very poor in South America and we are comparing again a very strong quarter of \u2013 in 2013. So it is a very tough comp. But origination results were down because of farmer selling. Crushing margins were normally \u2013 we were expecting it to be relatively low in Q4 because of a lack of beans and that's the end of the season. But we have, to be honest, I mean in a tough environment like that with poor farmer selling a low crushing margin, we also didn't help ourselves much.","And on top of that we have the transition of the fertilizer business. That business was discontinued and we transferred some of our operations to [mosaic] [ph], we had bad results coming out of that, as you can understand. It's a very volatile business, low margins and is difficult to manage in normal operations much more in a transition.","So I would say those are the impact that we have in South America in Q4. That makes us optimistic for Q1 because we think that farmer selling will come back, crush margins have already expanded both in Brazil and in Paraguay and certainly we will not have the issue of fertilizer. And we have the new port of Barcarena fully operational. So all in all, we think that that South American results was an issue that will stay in that Q4 and we don't expect it to be repeated.","Farha Aslam","So looking out into the first quarter, North American crush remains strong, South America recovers. So we should see a nice pick up in the crushing origination going into the first quarter?","Juan Luciano","Farha, directionally we expect Q1 to be stronger than Q4 for Oilseeds that is correct.","Farha Aslam","Okay. And then just moving to your Ag Services business. Clearly you had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter largely driven by exports. Do you anticipate the first quarter export volume out of North America to remain the same or to grow? And importantly, how do you think basis will work out in North America first quarter versus fourth quarter? Did you capture the harvest basis in the fourth quarter or will you still have more to capture in the first quarter?","Juan Luciano","Yes. Fourth quarter was very close to perfection, Farha. We had perfect harvest weather with the exception of maybe 10 days; weather conditions were very favorable to us because of our very strong transportation businesses. So when freight in rail and all that get complicated obviously we profit from that in our transportation \u2013 in barge transportation business that really excelled in Q4.","Obviously \u2013 and we were able to capture good basis, to be honest, during Q4. So we were very happy with that. As we roll into Q1, obviously the soybean export program kind of declined as South America becomes to pick up the pace there. We expect corn program to pick up during the quarter as the U.S. corn becomes more competitive against European destinations or Argentina.","So all in all, we have seen steady demand, not maybe spectacular demand, but not weak demand \u2013 steady demand. So we're looking at the execution of a good book, execution of \u2013 good execution margins in the interior, good storage margins, still good transportation P&L as we still \u2013 we see a lot of northbound freight being used. And we see descent carries in both corn and hard wheat. So all in all not as spectacular as Q4, but strong performance in Q1 for Ag Services.","Farha Aslam","Great. Thank you very much.","Juan Luciano","You are welcome, Farha.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thanks. I think that the \u2013 I'm trying to figure out Corn Processing for 2015. You have a good set up I would think in sweeteners and starches. I understand there have been some pretty significant price increases in high fructose corn syrup. Obviously, the bioproducts line is very difficult to forecast. Is it possible to isolate sweeteners and starches in your outlook here, Juan? Can this be a pretty significant improvement versus 2014 given the pricing? And then in addition, would you expect more of the grind to switch to sweeteners away from ethanol as you try to help the industry manage inventories?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Rob. So let me give you some perspective. So our expectations for sweeteners and starches for 2015 are pretty much in line to 2014. We expect moderate or relatively stable corn prices and so as such margins will be approximally comparable to 2014. On relatively for liquid sweeteners \u2013 relatively a stable volumes in that sense. We have other products where we are shifted demand that are growing a little bit faster. We have other geographies especially Southeast Asia where it is also growing a little bit faster.","We are still going to have the very incipient contribution of our high fructose corn syrup new investment in Tianjin, which is more like for a longer-term, not just that much 2015. So the way we are thinking, although we did better than our plan in 2014 for sweeteners and starches, we are thinking something comparable to 2014 in general.","Robert Moskow","Why wouldn't it be better? I mean, I thought there was some pretty good price increases taken at least in HFCS, why couldn't it be better?","Juan Luciano","It could, Rob, I am just thinking about when we look at the pricing system, we probably have about half of the \u2013 we had 2014 with some pressure on pricing on margins. And probably the first half of our negotiating period was under those conditions. And then probably the later half conditions become a little bit better industry, a little bit plan to be more balanced. So I would have \u2013 we have a little bit of that, but also a little bit of the past in our 2015 margin negotiations. So all in all, I think is mostly comparable if I said to 2014.","Robert Moskow","Last question. Do you think that your ethanol margins are \u2013 are your ethanol margins still positive right now?","Juan Luciano","Obviously, we have a set of units that are different, so we have some dry mills and we have some wet mills. I would say overall they are slightly positive.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","Juan Luciano","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, Ann.","Ray Young","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan","I am curious as to how you think about your business, particularly merchandising going forward in an environment of a stronger dollar and weaker other currencies. Do you change the way you do business anywhere or the way you think about merchandising globally?","Juan Luciano","Not really, Ann. I think that obviously the U.S. currency is getting stronger again most of the other currencies. But that tends to end up adjusting the prices of the commodity to find their own equilibrium. At the end of the day you may shift a little bit the timing of some of those exports, but at the end of the day the balances are the balances, the import nations have to import from the exporting nations those who are the ones that have the excesses.","So our teams adjust obviously to that, but I would say that is something that they do on a normal course of business as we have international teams that they adjust for all the other currencies as they move all the time as well. So, no exception for the U.S. team. I wouldn't read that much into that.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you. Because there is a lot of talk about corn exports from the U.S. and how they might be competitively disadvantaged versus maybe Brazil where perhaps we get more corn planted than we anticipated and they compete for the export market. But you are not anticipating any of that?","Juan Luciano","We see some of that, but the U.S. have come back and is competitive and we expect that to increase during Q1 as it develops, yes.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And are you willing to share with us at this point what your expectations are for planted acres in the U.S. this spring?","Juan Luciano","I would just refer to the USDA numbers at this point. I am sure my guys have an opinion but we will keep it to ourselves.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I appreciate that. And just real quick follow-up on ethanol. Ethanol benefited from very significant exports last year. I guess the same question with the strong dollar \u2013 would you expect exports of ethanol to decline given where oil prices are and the strength of the dollar?","Juan Luciano","No, at this point in time we expect ethanol exports to be in the range of $800 million for 2015. We are seeing that demand pretty stable. We have checked with most the countries and our customers and we don't see that. Ethanol continues to be the cheapest oxygenate out there and we monitor very closely all the other types. And at this point in time we feel very strongly about these 800 million gallons per year being there in 2015.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. I will get back in line.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Ann.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Juan Luciano","Michael, are you there?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Juan, I'm having trouble kind of reconciling what you actually think 2015 is going to be like versus 2014. I see a bunch of puts and takes, but I am just trying to circle back to in the past you guys would talk about you were about to have \u2013 the business was going to break out and we were going to get well through the sort of $3.00 threshold, which \u2013 I'm just trying to figure out, is that \u2013 your commentary today is very focused on getting the returns up and I understand that. But I'm also trying to understand whether you think 2015 over 2014 is really going to finally be that big year where the earnings actually break out.","Juan Luciano","Yes, Vince. We feel very strongly about 2015. I think that if you look at what we have done and with all the puts and takes as you described, we face every year to be honest. Every year we face conditions that are negative on one side and positive on the other side. But the overall is we have improved our portfolio. So there's going to be a lot of businesses that gave us trouble in 2014 that will not in 2015. There are a lot of units that without major divestiture that we are in the process of improving. That gives us hope and good expectations for 2015 that some of those results will be better. We have proven about with the Toepfer integration and which is halfway or maybe two-thirds through it, but it needs to continue and there are other things that we continue to improve. So we feel good about that as well.","We feel very good we have shown to everybody and to ourselves how our services can perform in an environment of good growth that we haven't seen over the last two years. So we feel good about how the business executes, but also how the business can run all those assets. And we continue to add to our cost improvements and operational efficiencies and that continues to go through the bottom line. When you put on top of that that we expect the WILD to continue to be as we expected contributing maybe accretive $0.10 to $0.15 during 2015 we feel very good about the combination of all of those factors. Will they be surprised during 2015? Of course, every year and we adjust to those. But overall we continue to see our plan unraveling very positively.","Vincent Andrews","Okay and just as a clarifying question. You talked about co-product hedges in the Corn Processing business. Could you just clarify what those were? I thought co-products were very difficult to hedge.","Ray Young","We did some proxy hedges on that using corn. And it didn't turn out the way we would have liked it. So that impacted some of our sweeteners and starches results in the fourth quarter.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much. I will pass it along.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Vince.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Hi. Can you hear me now?","Juan Luciano","Hi, Michael. Yes.","Michael Piken","Okay, perfect. Thanks. Yes, just wanted to circle back to Ag Services here for a minute. And specifically in the past you've talked about $200 million to $250 million in EBIT is relatively run line to use. In light of what you did in 4Q do you think there was some push forward in terms of some of the 2015 earnings, or is that the right run rate to use or with this record harvest should we be using a higher number?","Juan Luciano","It is difficult between \u2013 obviously in last quarter you had some things shifting from one quarter to the other, sometimes in one direction or the other. I would say the range that we're thinking about it for 2015 is something in the range of $850 million to $950 million. You have to think that when this realignment that we have of divisions of businesses within the division Ag Services has lost basically $50 million of annual profit that has been transferred to other businesses.","So considering that transfer we are thinking that the range you should consider is something between $850 million to $950 million per year.","Michael Piken","Okay, that is really helpful. And then with respect to kind of the WILD Flavors Specialty Ingredients, I know you had sort of targeted $0.10 to $0.15 of accretion for this year. I mean can you give us some sort of flavor for how quickly that can ramp up? You at your Analyst Day gave a revenue target, but what should we be thinking sort of in the outer years?","Ray Young","Yes. We provided the guidance when we announced the acquisition back in July. First full year $0.10 to $0.15 per share accretion. We are still on track towards that particular range, Mike. As we kind of work through our plans we see that in the numbers. Actually there may be a little bit of risk towards the downside just because of currency translation impacts, particularly on WILD's European business. But overall we still feel good about that range for calendar year 2015.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And then finally the last question is on the $550 million in cost savings that you are targeting over the next five years, can you give us some sort of breakdown by segment where you would expect to see the majority of that benefit? Thanks.","Juan Luciano","I would say \u2013 to be honest, I don't have it top of my head by segment. We have \u2013 internally we have a buy plan of like 10 categories. Some of those categories include things like margin for new products as we fight for the grind, we have categories about maintenance reduction or improvements, we have categories such as energy efficiency. I would say corn tends to add the bulk sometimes of that probably in the range of maybe 40% to 50% just because of the size of the asset. Ag Services has a little bit less because we have less fixed assets and more maybe transportation assets. So I would say, if I have to give a guess, but I don't have it, it is something like 50% Corn, maybe 35% Oilseeds, and maybe 15% Ag Services give or take.","Michael Piken","Okay. Thank you very much.","Juan Luciano","You are welcome, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak. Your line is open.","Tim Tiberio","Good morning and thanks for taking my question.","Juan Luciano","Hi, Tim.","Tim Tiberio","Juan, I guess looking at Oilseed demand, there's been a lot of focus in the questioning around farmers selling and utilization between North America and South America. But we have seen a little bit more commentary in the trade press around just a more uncertain environment around incremental Oilseed demand in Asia. Just wanted to kind of get your sense of how you are seeing that frame up on a full-year basis and then from the first half to the second half?","Juan Luciano","Yes. So at this point in time we're seeing still good export demand in the U.S., we have it for January and February. We expect there's going to be a little bit of a shift to that in March to South America. When we're looking to China, we see China feed demand a little bit down at this point in time. Profitability for farmers to raise pigs or chicken is not great at this point in time. Part is the slowdown in the economy; part is the government's anti-graft campaign because we do some consumption there. But we expect that as, I talk to my colleagues in China, to increase \u2013 to improve during the year. So right now it is a little bit soft.","Tim Tiberio","Okay. And is there any other regions that could potentially offset China? I know there has been some talk about India potentially liberalizing their imports, tax regime on Oilseeds. Is that kind of factored into your outlook or that is just still difficult to handicap at this point?","Juan Luciano","I would say you continue to see poultry consumption growing per capita basis in India, so that is also obviously bullish since there are like 1.4 billion people. I would say overall we continue to see mill demand growing 3% to 4% year-over-year and we feel good about that. So I think China has these ups and downs, but we don't foresee a slowdown in demand at this point in time for 2015. We still believe 3% to 4% up in mill demand.","Tim Tiberio","Great. And then just shifting gears back to WILD Flavors. There was a lot of talk at your Investor Day that really the next stage is taking this platform and really proliferating it out to a lot of your CPG relationships.","Juan Luciano","Yes.","Tim Tiberio","Can you just kind of talk, I know it is still early days, but how is the win rates looking with a lot of your large CPG clients? Any notable wins in the quarter? How is that progress tracking to your expectations?","Juan Luciano","Yes, that is a great question, Tim. Listen, the first thing that I would like to say about WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients is that I am pleased to report that we are getting the people equation right. In this case the capabilities obviously are there. Both were successful companies individually in their own right in ingredients so the capabilities are intact. But the issue is can you combine the people and can you get that? And I am pleased to report that is going extremely well. So we are very confident we are going to beat our 2015 synergy targets.","In terms of customer, we have had more than 100 customer engagements so far and we have recorded, I was checking with the team late last week, I have every Friday a meeting with them to check this. We had more than 355 ideas with actual efforts behind for each customer. So I wouldn't disclose any specific customer obviously for confidentiality reasons. These are all innovations that we will keep to ourselves and then hopefully you will see it reflected in revenue growth. But we are very enthusiastic about how customers are responding to the combined capabilities of both companies.","Tim Tiberio","Great. Thanks for your time and I will pass it along.","Juan Luciano","You are welcome, Tim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","Juan Luciano","David, are you there?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO. Your line is open.","Ken Zaslow","Good morning, everyone.","Juan Luciano","Hi, Ken.","Ray Young","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow","I just want to go back to the ethanol just because I am puzzled by it a little bit. So how do ethanol margins actually go higher in this current oil and corn environment? You think corn is going to stay relatively stable and oil stays stable. If supply gets cut, ethanol prices need to trade at a premium to GAAP. Is that a sustainable situation? I guess that is where I'm kind of having a hard time with the ethanol margin recovery.","Juan Luciano","So I think, listen, I see \u2013 we see driving miles of gasoline consumption going up and we see stable exports out there. So but the issue is did we produce at 15 billion gallons is \u2013 we're now going to have excellent margins. So at the end of the day, it will require some rationalization of capacity. We expect some of these low margins that we're having right now giving people some \u2013 giving people in the high part of the cost curve some problems. And that is why we continue to emphasize our cost position and that is all we can drive. All we can drive is our cost position, our fight for the grind and the way we commercially \u2013 we commercially play between produced gallons and purchased gallons. So other than that it is all speculation, to be honest.","Ken Zaslow","Okay. So you think that gas can trade at a premium to ethanol and the demand will remain, that's fair?","Juan Luciano","Yes, yes, we think so. Yes.","Ken Zaslow","Okay. On the --","Juan Luciano","Remember that you have $0.70 [wins] [ph] at this point in time. And I think that we can go 10% higher and we can still be a very competitive oxygenate out there.","Ken Zaslow","Okay. That is fair. That is kind of lessen my confusion was trying to figuring that out. I appreciate it. On Ag Services, the $850 million to $950 million \u2013 sorry\u2026","Juan Luciano","Go ahead.","Ken Zaslow","The Ag Services, $850 million to $950 million is roughly in that $200 million per quarter basis. Over the next two to three years, as you make these improvements that you have been talking about at the Analyst Day, and it seems like maybe there even some cost-cutting there. Will that go up to say $250 million to $300 million per quarter like \u2013 or how does that shift? It seems like you have very tangible gains to be had here. And I am just trying to put a number around that. Is that a fair point saying about $50 million to $100 million after all these adjustments are made?","Juan Luciano","Ken, the way I think about Ag Services is we believe Ag Services will continue to go up hopefully in that range. It is difficult for me to quantify it and I tell you why. In the other businesses we can add some of the cost improvements. In Ag Services it becomes a little bit more based on whether we add an investment that increases our origination or our transportation or we do something like we did with Toepfer in which we combined in the global trade desk or we move more into destination marketing and we capture a bigger part of the margin there. So our plans and our expectation are that that range is going to evolve over time. It is a little bit more difficult to say exactly the number at this point. And I wouldn't venture that. But we are continuing to build to increase margins and our share in Ag Services.","Ken Zaslow","Okay. My final question is, at the Analyst Day you guys said that there was a level of preparedness. I like that word that you used for Ag Services. And obviously that generated a very, very significant return during the quarter. Do you feel like you can get the same preparedness that you had in the third quarter \u2013 for the fourth quarter that you all have for the first quarter?","Juan Luciano","Absolutely, absolutely. We are very well prepared to handle this first quarter. It would be, as I said, a different quarter. When I was saying the preparedness is because obviously this team was so looking forward to show what their asset base and their capabilities could do in a full crop because of the two very bad years in the previous crop. But absolutely they are the same level of preparedness for Q1.","Ken Zaslow","Great. I really appreciate it. Thank you.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is Open.","David Driscoll","Hi. Can you hear me?","Juan Luciano","David, yes, we can.","David Driscoll","All right. You really can. Boy that was a struggle. So good morning and congratulations on the results, Juan and team.","Juan Luciano","Thank you.","David Driscoll","Wanted to just maybe clear up a couple of points on ethanol. I think you said in a previous comment that you thought you would see I think you said you felt very strongly about 800 million gallons of ethanol exports. Is that correct?","Juan Luciano","Yes.","David Driscoll","Yes. So then if you add to that somewhere 13.7 million to 14 million gallons of E10, well, why would you not feel confident that we are not going to see a very tight balance in 2015 on ethanol supply and demand?","Juan Luciano","I do feel confident that we will see a tight balance. As I said, I don't think that all the plants will run at the rate that they were running in November \u2013 on a full-year basis. So the problem with ethanol, David, and this is the problem to model \u2013 and uncertainty sometimes around ethanol is that it moves during the year because of the gasoline consumption has a system. And obviously, our ability also to produce a max rate has a season as well.","So sometimes those things \u2013 plants can produce at higher rates when people can drive less. And that produced a little bit of a spike of margin in the summer and a little bit of a drop of a margin as we get to the end of the year. But we continue to be positive about the overall balances in ethanol, David, yes.","David Driscoll","Okay. And then just my final question, and you answered this a little bit before, but I want to just be clear on something. This interaction between North American crush margin results and South American crush margin results, are you trying to draw a parallel here by saying that North American fourth quarter crush margins were particularly strong in part due to the weakness in South American farmer selling exports, et cetera? Are these two factors interrelated as kind of one gives to the other, or was there specific issues in your South American unit that are isolated, such that in a future period we could see both good results simultaneously in both geographies?","Juan Luciano","Yes. So let me split that question in two. On the impact of South America maybe not a lot of slow farmers selling or being a little bit delayed. We felt \u2013 we feel it two ways. One in better soy crush margins in Europe, not in North America. And we tried to shift during Q4 more crush from rapeseed into soy just because we didn't see that much meal coming to compete in Europe from South America. So you saw it that way.","And also you could see it by having a longer export program in Q1 in North America, that is the way you see it. And to the second point of your question is absolutely we can see times in which both are doing very well. As I said, we have a lot of issues on our own in South America in this quarter, not only the farmer selling, but we have fertilizers and some other issues that we had there as well. So absolutely you could see both doing very well in another quarter.","Ray Young","In fact, David, you saw that last year. Last year's fourth quarter you actually saw South America do extremely well and North America do extremely well. This year we saw North America do extremely well; South America did not do as well. And frankly a lot of the things that occurred in South America was our own doing. So when I kind of look at the results I look at South America just a comparison of fourth quarter this year versus last year just directionally. There was about a $100 million swing in South America just because of factors that frankly we didn't help ourselves with. And so that just gives you an order of magnitude in terms of what the delta was in Q4 here related to South America.","David Driscoll","And then, guys, to tie it together, what you said in the press release in the \u2013 I don't know \u2013 second or third paragraph was that you expect South American Oilseeds will have higher returns in totality in 2015 versus 2014, correct?","Juan Luciano","Yes. That is correct.","David Driscoll","So then it sets up to be a very good year in Oilseeds and maybe this fourth quarter issue in South America is not what we should focus on, but rather the bigger picture of good strong tight balances within Oilseed Processing?","Juan Luciano","You got it, yes.","David Driscoll","Thank you. I will pass it along.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Luciano","Hi, Adam.","Adam Samuelson","A lot of ground has been covered today, but I want a question on the cost savings and thinking about that 2015 bridge. The exceeding $400 million target in 2014, not a lot of that came through in the second half of the year because, if I recall correctly, it was the second quarter of 2014 where you increased that cost savings target. How should I think about the year-on-year increment of savings realized in 2015 versus what you actually flowed through the P&L in 2014?","Juan Luciano","Yes. I think you should expect from these programs about $100 million going into 2015.","Adam Samuelson","And is that \u2013 to your earlier comment, is that mostly coming through in Corn \u2013 or at least Corn and Oilseeds are the majority but Corn the biggest one?","Juan Luciano","That is a general comment. I mean when we tried to assign that $100 million of course it applies. But don't hold me to it. I may update you later on that. And also, you have to offset some inflation obviously that we have every year. But yes, about $100 million should roll into 2015 out of our cost-saving programs.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That is very helpful. And then can you just help us think with WILD and the new business unit, the Specialty Ingredient business unit in total, how the reporting there is going to look in thinking about metrics? I mean this is \u2013 I mean revenues for your Company historically have not been a particularly meaningful metric. I think for that business unit it actually will. Can you help us think about the organic growth of volume and price mix that you would kind of think about on a run rate basis for that unit going forward?","Juan Luciano","Yes. We have been working on that, Adam, because, as you said so correctly, sometimes for Ingredients it should be revenue growth. But on the other hand, remember that this division is composed by $1 billion of WILD which reacts like you describe. But also $1.5 billion from products that we contributed, that some of them are soy proteins that when soy comes down sometimes we expand margins, but actually revenue goes down. So we are trying to come up with a good set of measurements that actually reflect the performance of the business without getting \u2013 without misleading people on that.","So I think for a while it will be a combination of strong revenue growth, strong gains in some customers or maybe volumes and also returns, obviously. Margins are relatively healthy in that industry. So just percentage margins are not that important at that point, it is more about winning businesses.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, all right. Thanks very much.","Juan Luciano","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Massoud with Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Massoud","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a better sense of what is being embedded in your ethanol assumptions. So specifically the ethanol export figure at 800 million gallon included in that is there an assumption out there that there is going to be lower exports out of say Brazil because of the higher blend rates that are going to occur down there this year? And so in effect you will be taking market share?","Juan Luciano","Yes. I think that obviously Brazilians are trying to help the sugar mills in general and so more is going to be used internally at the same time that they are increasing gasoline prices. So we don't expect Brazil to be a competitor for exports out there. And it may be a recipient of some of the U.S. exports. So certainly we don't see Brazil at this point in time as a big threat.","Paul Massoud","Okay. And then just if we shifted slightly to the margin side of things, I mean we have seen this in the trade rags that China is looking for more DDGs. And so we've seen a recovery in those DDG prices. And so I guess I am wondering, Juan, when do you start to see those price increases in DDGs hit your drive mill margin specifically? And is that part of the assumption that you will see a margin recovery for that business?","Juan Luciano","Yes. They are \u2013 DDG prices, we are already there. I mean we have seen that increase. China has been taking DDGs for probably a month already. So we have seen that increase. We feel good about it.","Paul Massoud","Is there more upside --?","Juan Luciano","Sorry, it helps also the dynamics of soybean meal. As Soybean meal \u2013 as DDG been taken out of their domestic ration sometimes, so sorry, go ahead.","Paul Massoud","No. I was just curious if you thought the trajectory is still to the upside or are you effectively assuming that you are just going to hold steady where we are at now?","Juan Luciano","Well, I think there is still some upside to DDGs as well, yes.","Paul Massoud","Okay. And then one question on sorghum. I mean we've seen Chinese sorghum demand tick up pretty significantly here. Is that an area where you guys are participating in any material way?","Juan Luciano","Yes. Ag Services is a player as well in sorghum exports, yes.","Paul Massoud","Could you give us a sense of the percentage of volumes that sorghum accounts for and how that's kind of grown over the last couple of years?","Juan Luciano","I don't have it top of my head to be honest.","Paul Massoud","All right. No problem. I guess the last question I have got here is just sort of going to \u2013 going back to the Analyst Day. I mean you talked about Ag Services shifting focus from port of export to the end-user. So I was just curious what your current philosophy is on energy hedging, whether or not you have got hedges on the books now. I know you've got ships out there. And so I assume that there is some commodity price that you are hedged at. But how do you see that evolving over time as you make that transition over the next few years?","Ray Young","I think on energy hedging, I mean we really don't really hedge \u2013 talking about crude oil hedge or bunker oil hedges, we really don't do much of that.","Paul Massoud","So there are no fuel cost hedges for ships then I guess?","Juan Luciano","No. We hedge mostly natural gas which is the big input for ethanol. That is where we hedge and where there is a very good market for that.","Paul Massoud","Okay. Thanks for the questions.","Juan Luciano","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Eric Larson","Hi, good morning, everyone. I will be relatively quick. Can you hear me?","Juan Luciano","Sure, Eric.","Eric Larson","Okay. Can I get a quick flavor? You mentioned earlier in your comments, Juan, in prepared comments, about you really had really pretty good basis capture in soybeans in the fourth quarter, probably pretty near to ideal type conditions. And clearly you probably had near ideal conditions for transportation revenues. But Corn was certainly suboptimal. I mean I don't think any of us would have predicted what happened with Corn and that fourth quarter. But looking to the fourth quarter of this year, taking those two complexes together, is there the ability to improve basis capture and just assume a normal crop, a normal harvest? Was there anything so extraordinary in the soybean structure this year that it would be hard to repeat that next year? Or this year, excuse me, in 2015?","Juan Luciano","So you \u2013 sorry, let me clarify your question. You said that if we can repeat our performance of this Q4 in next Q4 given the --?","Eric Larson","Yes. Well, given particularly the strength probably in the soybean side. I realize that Corn was probably suboptimal, but is it a repeatable performance next year \u2013 this year versus what you had last year?","Juan Luciano","I think so. Listen, I \u2013 you can see the strength of the way our team played with these conditions. Last year we made it more into the summer and this year we have a great performance now into the winter. So every year there is a picking which you make the profit given the market conditions. And I think that the team adjusts to that. But we see no reason for which not being able to repeat this next Q4.","Eric Larson","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on all of that. Looking forward, talking about overall demand and looking at demand into next year, is there sufficient demand to let's say if you had a normal crop year to reduce our carryovers in crops next year? Or should we gradually see a little bit of a build here in our Corn and Soybean carryovers given the strength of the U.S. dollar particularly? And I guess the only offsetting factor, particularly like in Corn, there is always talk that China could be a 20 million to 25 million metric ton buyer that crops up all the time.","Any comments on the demand side on that function? And it seems to me that the general direction of Corn and maybe Soybeans over the next 12 months, a year from now I would expect those complexes to be lower, but I am interested in your thoughts.","Ray Young","I mean I think demand \u2013 I mean, if you looked at trend lines in demand, they continue to be very positive whether it be corn, soybean or meal around the world. So nothing fundamentally has changed in terms of our long-term assessment of continued demand growth for these agricultural products. As you know, we have actually had pretty favorable supply conditions over the past couple of years. And as you know, weather it is a factor.","So when you ask the question about what carry out in the future will be, we feel pretty good about the demand side. In the supply-side there are definitely weather aberrations somewhere around the world, which will impact the supply-side and that will have an impact on carry out. But generally speaking, we feel that we are in a pretty good environment right now in terms of just general global supply\/demand balances and frankly, subdued commodity prices into soft goods.","Juan Luciano","But if you look, Eric, also \u2013 if you look at the overall production and planted area around the world, it continues to grow and it's been growing for a while and it will have to continue to grow as we need to feed the growing population. So we continue to see this 3%, 4% increase that Ray has just described. And I think that we will have to count with the favorable weather to continue with this. But we foresee stable crop prices let's say going forward.","Eric Larson","Okay. Stable crop prices? Okay. And is there any window for China to be a 25 million metric ton buyer anytime soon of U.S. corn?","Juan Luciano","Oh, hard to say, Eric. I don't know if I can answer with any \u2013 I mean it is just speculation to be honest at this point.","Eric Larson","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Eric.","Operator","As there are no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to Juan Luciano.","Juan Luciano","Okay. We thank you very much for participating and see you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"2995":["Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mark Schweitzer, Vice President, Investor Relations for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. Schweitzer, you may begin.","Mark Schweitzer - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's first quarter earnings webcast. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com.","For those following the presentation, please turn to slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.","On today's webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Office, Juan Luciano, will provide an overview of the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results as well as the drivers of our performance in the quarter. Then Juan will provide an update of the progress of our strategy and discuss our forward look. And finally, they will take your questions.","Please turn to slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.68. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $717 million. ADM executed exceptionally well in the first quarter, and we harvested the benefits of the strategic actions we took over the last few years delivering the strong results.","As you remember, last month, we realigned our business units to further accelerate our growth efforts, and each of those business teams performed well this quarter. In Origination, the Global Trade business delivered their fourth consecutive profitable quarter, and they have best first quarter in four years. Our Oilseeds team made the right investments and put the right pieces in place, so they could run at record volumes and capture the benefits from margin opportunities.","In both of those businesses, certain mark-to-market timing effects, which should reverse in the coming quarters, mask the underlying strength of the team's performances during the quarter. In Carbohydrate Solutions, our strategic expansions and investments are continuing to deliver results and our Nutrition business had another quarter of top line growth including double-digit year-over-year growth from animal nutrition.","Looking forward, we are focusing our growth efforts on five key platforms \u2013 animal nutrition, bioactives, carbohydrates, human nutrition and taste, as well as geographic regions that are seeing increasing consumer demand. And through Readiness, we continued to reduce costs, we're enhancing our agility, streamlining and standardizing our processes, and implementing innovative technologies for our businesses and our customers.","When taken together, the continued execution of our strategic plan combined with our first quarter results, improving market conditions, and the benefits of U.S. tax reform lead us to be even more confident about 2018.","Later on this call, I'll discuss further the outlook for our business.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Okay. Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.68, up from the $0.60 in the prior-year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $717 million, up $39 million from the year-ago quarter.","We had some unique factors impacting both our reported and adjusted results for the quarter. We recorded a positive net operational impact related to the retroactive application of the 2017 biodiesel tax credit, which was worth about $120 million. We also had significant negative mark-to-market timing effects related to hedges for future cash contracts in Origination and Oilseeds, which were worth about $150 million in aggregate. So these two impacts, more or less, offset each other in the quarter, particularly on an after-tax basis. I will be further elaborating on these impacts later.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 15% and was favorably impacted by U.S. tax reform, the 2017 biodiesel tax credit, geographic mix, and several favorable discrete tax items, including a $14 million adjustment to the transition tax recorded in the fourth quarter. If the biodiesel tax credit and the favorable adjustment to the transition tax were excluded, the effective tax rate would be about 19%.","After considering our first quarter results, we expect our 2018 calendar year effective tax rate to be between 16% and 18%. Looking ahead, as an ongoing run rate after 2018, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 17% and 20%. This is below the 20% to 23% guidance we provided to you at the end of the fourth quarter, as we have further refined our estimates, taking the consideration a better forecast of the new provisions in the tax code.","Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.4% is 15 basis points above our 2018 annual WACC of 6.25%, thus again, generating positive EVA. On chart 19 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.70 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share. For the quarter, we had $0.01 per share credit related to LIFO, a $0.02 per share charge related to impairments and restructurings, and a $0.03 per share benefit related to the favorable adjustment to the transition tax booked in the fourth quarter, which I referred to earlier.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. In the Other segment, we had unfavorable results compared to the prior year due to lower underwriting results at our captive insurance operations and customer loss provisions at our futures commission merchant business. We expect the one-time variance of approximately $20 million will impact our 2018 calendar year results by a similar magnitude.","In the Corporate line, net interest expense for the quarter was up slightly due to funding higher working capital levels. Looking ahead, we're projecting net interest expense for 2018 to be slightly higher by about $10 million than the $310 million we recorded in 2017 with expectations of higher inventory ownership positions.","Unallocated corporate costs of $146 million were up about $20 million versus the prior year, due to a corporate initiative that will have an offsetting benefit in tax expense. For the rest of 2018, we're expecting unallocated corporate costs in the range of $140 million per quarter, in line with the guidance that we provided to you for the 2018 calendar year with the company accelerating its investments in R&D, innovation, and business transformation.","Turning to our cash flow statement for the quarter on slide 6, we generated $553 million from operations before working capital changes, slightly higher than the prior year. We made investments in inventory, as favorable carries in the market and the willingness of growers to sell their crops presented opportunities for us to take on a greater ownership position. In addition, typically from a seasonal perspective, the first quarter sees a net outflow of cash due to the cycle of accounts payable to U.S. farmers, which is further impacted by U.S. tax reform.","Total capital spending was $196 million, in line with our expectation for the year. We returned approximately $190 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Therefore, we had a balanced approach towards CapEx spending and return of capital to shareholders during the quarter. Our average share count for the quarter was 565 million diluted shares outstanding.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31 for 2018 and 2017. Our balance sheet remains solid. Our operating working capital of $9.2 billion was up $1.8 billion versus the year-ago period, primarily due to higher inventory ownership positions. We also had certain higher receivables, which will unwind over the next quarter.","Total debt was about $9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash, of $8.2 billion. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 30%, up from the year-end 2017 level of 27% due to higher working capital and the normal seasonality of working capital in the first quarter.","Our shareholders' equity of $18.7 billion was up from the $17.1 billion last year, primarily due to changes in the currency translation count as the U.S. dollar weakened. We had $5.1 billion in available global credit capacity end of March. If you add the available cash, we have access to almost $6 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next, I'll discuss our business performance for the quarter. Please turn to slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $717 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, up from the $678 million in last year's first quarter. Our results included negative mark-to-market timing effects, which were largely offset by income from the 2017 biodiesel tax credit. Most of these timing effects are expected to reverse in the coming quarters.","Now, I'll review the performance of each segment. Starting on slide 9, Origination results were in line with the prior year. Merchandising and handling was up significantly year-over-year. The Global Trade team continued their turnaround, delivering their fourth profitable quarter in a row and their best first quarter in four years. Substantially higher margins and increased volumes including from our investments in destination marketing contributed to their performance.","North American Grain was down compared to the first quarter of 2017. The lack of U.S. export competitiveness at the beginning of the quarter led to volumes and margins that were lower than the prior year. In addition, increasing forward export margins and barge freight rates in the first quarter resulted in approximately $40 million of negative mark-to-market impacts on existing contracts. Those impacts are expected to reverse in the future quarters, as contracts are executed. Strong bases and execution gains in wheat partially offset those effects. Transportation was down, as high river levels limited operations resulting in increased costs and lower volumes for ARTCO.","Please turn to slide 10. Oilseeds was up over the first quarter of 2017, as the operating environment continued to improve. Global market dynamics continue to push soybean crush margins higher and the business set record soy crush volumes. Improving crush margins resulted in negative timing effects of more than $100 million. In fact, more like $110 million on forward hedges, which led to crushing and origination results that were lower than the year-ago period. The vast majority of those impacts are expected to reverse over the course of 2018. South America saw strong origination volumes and improving margins, as farmers selling accelerated. Softseeds were down on lower margins and some negative timing impacts.","Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were substantially higher on the retroactive passage of the 2017 biodiesel tax credit, which accounted for approximately $120 million and increased volumes in North and South America. Europe was pressured by imports of Argentine biodiesel. Asia was lower on Wilmar results, as Wilmar recognized deferred tax benefits to their earnings in the year-ago quarter.","On the crushing and origination side, our Oilseeds Group managed the business extremely well through a complex quarter. Our investments and enhancements in cost, flexibility, and productivity had some of our facilities contribute to our ability to crush at a record level and capitalize on the strong market environment. In RPBO, it's important to remember that we made a choice in how we manage risk in 2017 related to the biodiesel tax credit in 2017, and that execution has now paid off.","Slide 11, please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were in line with the year-ago quarter, as we saw continued strength in starches and sweeteners, offset by weak ethanol industry margin environment. Starches and sweeteners was up over the prior year. The North American business delivered another strong quarter with joint ventures ALMEX and Red Star contributing positively to results. Chamtor increasingly contributed in Europe, while sales in Asia were slightly lower. Wheat milling was up, benefiting from strong margins. Bioproducts results were down versus the year-ago quarter due to pressured industry ethanol margins and lower volumes in industrial and beverage alcohol.","On slide 12, Nutrition was up versus the prior year-ago period. WFSI results were in line with the first quarter of 2017. In WILD Flavors, a good sales mix with a higher share of flavors, colors, and systems supported solid margin, another quarter of double-digit profit increases versus the prior-year period. Specialty ingredients results were lower on inventory adjustments and an unplanned production outage. Sales volumes were up for specialty ingredients for the quarter, as both Campo Grande specialty proteins team and the Tianjin Fibersol team drive towards full utilization.","Animal nutrition results were up significantly over the first quarter of 2017 with strong trade sales and a good sales mix. The team's strong inventory position helped us capitalize on higher sales prices. On the specialty animal feed side, improvements in the lysine business continue to contribute to results.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Juan. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to slide 13. Before we talk about our strategic accomplishments in the first quarter, I would like to take a moment to explain a little bit about some of our recent changes and focus. First, we announced in the first quarter the realignment of our business segments to reflect the company's new operating structure and our continuing evolution. Given our strategies and priorities, our realigned business units will allow for better synergies and utilization of resources and better reflect how we're running now our businesses.","For example, moving wheat milling into our new Carbohydrate Solutions business means our two starch processing operations now can work more closely together to develop and sell products. And it offered cost and efficiency synergies as well, but the corn business impressive operational excellence expertise can benefit our milling operations. Moving animal nutrition into the Nutrition business unit means that our pet treat team, which grew significantly with last year's addition of Crosswind Industries, will have the opportunity to work more closely with our flavor and color experts at WILD to create products for this fast-growing market.","Bioactives and nutrition will also benefit from being in the same business, as the continued move toward personalized nutrition is closely related to increasing health consciousness among food and beverage consumers. Therefore, the time was right to make the changes in the first quarter and our first quarter reporting reflects the realignment. To assist you with comparisons, we have included a recasting of last year's quarterly segment operating profit under the new segmentation in the Appendix.","Looking forward, we're going to continue to drive growth by focusing our efforts on five key platforms that we believe can lead to stronger earnings and returns. They are animal nutrition, bioactives, carbohydrates, human nutrition, and taste. While ADM will always play a critical role in feeding a protein-hungry world whose population will surpass 9.5 billion by the middle of this century, our mission has also evolved to include providing better nutrition for consumers worldwide which has a positive impact on people's quality of life. Our focus on the five key platforms will help us fulfill that mission.","And finally, all of our efforts will be informed and improved by Readiness, which will drive efficiencies and improve the customer experience in our existing businesses through a combination of lean manufacturing, processes standardization and digital design and will also support the execution of our growth strategies in our key growth platforms. I will further elaborate on Readiness on the next slide.","Slide 14, please, and a review of some of our accomplishments in the first quarter. In our first strategic pillar, we are seeing the results of the actions we have taken to enhance the core. Last quarter, we talked about fixing leakages, specific limited areas where our execution wasn't as strong as it should have been. We saw significant improvements throughout 2017. And in the first quarter of 2018, we have had a great start in terms of the team's performance.","For example, our Global Trade team delivered a very strong turnaround in first quarter results and continued its run of strong quarters. Our Oilseeds business delivered important cost savings and margin recovery in South America. And our yield and productivity self-help has led to a turnaround of our lysine business. We're also enhancing our core in Origination with our continued expansion of destination marketing. Actually, earlier this month, we signed a deal with Peel Ports Group to utilize its Glasgow port facilities, allowing us to expand our destination marketing capabilities in Northern England and Scotland.","Our second pillar, enhancing readiness, is an area of intense focus. Readiness is an evolution of our ongoing work to leverage technology to improve and standardize processes, reduce costs, drive growth, enhance the customer experience, and build our competitive advantage, all while preserving the positive aspects of our culture.","Today, we require more speed and agility than ever. That's why we have decided to expand our readiness efforts to include performance excellence spanning our entire business model. We'll be integrating, prioritizing and resourcing key existing projects under one umbrella while significantly broadening and accelerating the entire effort not just on costs, but also on revenues.","As the signs of the importance of these expanded efforts, we have asked Joe Taets, one of our most senior and respected executives, to lead the new Readiness efforts going forward. Joe will be focused on helping the organization drive additional efficiencies more quickly and on improving the customer experience.","Our 1ADM business transformation remains a key part of Readiness. During the first quarter, we expanded 1ADM to our ocean freight and European corporate finance operations, and the Readiness will be further expanding 1ADM to cover the entire enterprise. During the first quarter, we have generated operational cost savings of $70 million on a run rate basis and are on pace to exceed our 2018 target of $200 million.","In our third pillar, strategic growth, we are supporting our new growth platforms with the opening of our new enzyme lab, which will expand our ability to develop and commercialize a wide range of enzymes and, in particular, will advance our animal health enzyme partnership with Vland Biotech. We're also continuing our geographic growth with the formation of a joint venture with Cargill that will further produce and supply soybean meal and oil for customers in the fast-growing Egyptian market, as well as an expansion into the Russian starches and sweeteners market via a joint venture with Aston Foods. This highlights several of the actions we took in the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress regularly.","You could please turn to slide 15 for a look forward. In Origination, for the second quarter, we are expecting a small portion of the timing impacts that negatively affected Q1 results to reverse. High river conditions have continued to impact our core operations (00:24:23). ADM is one of the largest exporters of U.S. sorghum to China and we do expect a negative impact of about $30 million in the second quarter related to the Chinese deposits being imposed on that trade. Other than the negative impact on the sorghum issue, we expect Origination's second quarter performance to be more or less in line with the year-ago period.","Looking further forward, we expect Origination to have significantly improved results in the second half of the year as U.S. export dynamics improve due to the reduced Argentina soy and corn crops and Brazil corn crop and as negative timing impacts for the first quarter continue to reverse. For the calendar year, we expect solid fundamental improvements in Origination results compared to 2017.","Oilseeds will continue to capitalize on improving market conditions in the second quarter and will additionally benefit from the reversal of some significant timing effects from the first quarter. We expect Oilseeds to deliver significantly improved results in Q2 versus the prior-year quarter. For the calendar year, with improved soybean crush volumes and margins, a better origination margin environment in Brazil, and the expected launch of our Egypt joint venture and completion of our Bolivia divestiture, we expect Oilseeds to substantially improve results over 2017, even absent the Q1 income drive from the retroactive 2017 biodiesel tax credit.","We expect Carbohydrate Solutions to continue to be impacted by weak ethanol margins leading to results in the second quarter that will be lower than the equivalent period last year. As the rest of the year unfolds, we're expecting starches and sweeteners to continue to see good demand in an environment of tight industry utilization. We should also see some additional contributions when our new Russian joint venture is launched. All told, we think Carbohydrate Solutions' result for the full year will be roughly similar to 2017, but with a big variable will be how ethanol margins evolve throughout the rest of the year.","In Nutrition, we expect continuous sales growth to help deliver improved performance in the second quarter. From a seasonal perspective, the second quarter should be the strongest quarter of the year. For the full year, growing sales, continuous strong performance from WILD, plus increasing contributions from both improvements in animal nutrition and new facilities are expected to result in a solid 20%-plus growth in operating profit versus full-year 2017.","Altogether, we are well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions for the balance of 2018. We continue to closely monitor trade developments both in terms of NAFTA as well as U.S.-China developments that seem to evolve almost on a daily basis. So overall, we are pleased with where we are. We've built up our earnings power through the actions we have taken over the past few years, and we're seeing the results in our bottom line as headwinds turn to tailwinds.","Looking forward, with our new business structure, a sharper focus on key growth areas, new accelerating Readiness efforts, and a lower effective tax rate, we're even more confident about delivering significantly improved results in 2018 and excited about our future in the years to come.","With that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Your line is open.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Heather.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Heather.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","I had a quick clarification question. Did you say in Oilseeds that you expect Q2 to be substantially better than last year, but only a portion of the Q1 mark-to-market to reverse?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, that's correct.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","And well, actually \u2013 we actually expect roughly half of the mark-to-market to reverse in Q2 related to Oilseeds. In the case of ag \u2013 Origination, that's going to be more of a Q3 impact, but with respect to the timing of impacts of Oilseeds, roughly half will reverse in Q2.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","And when I'm thinking about the year-on-year swing for Q1 in Oilseeds, the mark-to-market, so it's about $110 million this year, but wasn't it a help in Q1 of 2017, so the year-on-year swing was even bigger than $110 million?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. It was a favorable impact last year. We didn't outline it because it is less than normally a $50 million impact we would online, but it was a small favorable impact last year.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay. I wanted to talk to you about the sustainability of the soy crush margin. There seems to be some belief out there that this is just a function of Argentine weather, and that next year we could see a return to more depressed environment like 2017. I was wondering if you could speak to what you think the drivers are of this improved environment and your view of the staying power.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, Heather. The drought in Argentina certainly contributed to the increase in soy crush margins, but we foresaw these crush margins expanding even before the extent of the Argentine drought was known, and it was in the several factors. First of all, there has been not only a drought issue in Argentina, but a little bit of a structural change with the monthly reduction in the soybean export tax that had effectively created a curve in the market and that began in 2018.","And also, the U.S. tariff that has been placed on Argentine biodiesel effectively stopping the flow of Argentine biodiesel into the U.S. has changed a little bit the dynamics internally. So, the Argentine crusher has become more disciplined. And I think we see less of mill being subsidized by biodiesel from Argentina, if you will. So, that's one factor there, Argentine dynamic outside the drought. And that's a more permanent dynamic that will stay with us.","I think also the Brazilian origination industry has become more rational, following an exceptional challenge in 2017. I think we all learned about that year and we all reduced our take-or-pay commitments, and we are not facing the same mismatch between farmer selling and customer buying that we faced. Demand continues to be strong around the world. We think in this year about 4% increase. And we don't see in the first quarter the same impact we saw last year of having to absorb (00:32:28) that we had last year. So, in that sense, the power of substitute to hurt this year has been reduced and will be into the future.","We also \u2013 we have seen that with all these changes, the global buyer has become less hand-to-mouth. Over the last few years, there has been a big destocking. And that situation forced us to be more on the spot, if you will, when we cannot buy a book. Now, with the refill with more of a scarcity value returning to the market, the global buyer wants to lock in their cost, and that resulting in better operating environment for us because we can position better. We can work our optionality better. When you add all these, plus everything that we have been doing in terms of cost control and swing capacity in our facilities, we feel very strongly about not only the sustainability of this margin, but the sustainability and improvement of our performance in the years to come.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Awesome. Thank you so much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Heather.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Adam.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hey. Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So maybe continuing on Oilseeds, and I don't want you to just lose some of the confidence and some of the drivers there. I think your exact phrasing was significantly ahead of 2017. And I guess I'm trying to frame it given board crush margins today and even forward crush margins today that sit near multi-year highs. And thinking about kind of banding kind of how much improvement you could actually realize in your base results, especially given some of the weakness in cash markets and South American Origination that you experienced last year that seems to be reversing.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. As I described before, I think we're not only going to see an improvement in Origination in South America. (00:34:34) market part is we have improved and our team, but also in Oilseeds. And listen, we have confidence that we could see Oilseeds achieve about $1 billion or north of $1 billion of operating profit in 2018 even after excluding the credit of the retroactive application of the 2017 biodiesel tax credit. So, that's a significant increase over the about $850 million of adjusted OP that we achieved last year. So we feel very good about it.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And just to be clear on that, I mean ADM crushes 30-or-so million tons a year of soybeans, $150 million increase in profit even exclusive of the biodiesel tax credit. I mean the board crush margins have expanded significantly more than that, so I'm just trying to make sure I'm not thinking about that wrong or where the deltas are on the negative side that would be tempering some of that year-on-year improvement.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Don't forget the South America and Brazil Origination is a significant turnaround versus last year. So when you look at the Oilseeds segment, you're not looking solely at the crush margin. You also need to look at the South America, particularly the Brazil Origination. And in the first quarter, it is a significant turnaround, and we expect that to continue over the rest of the year as well.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a quick question on ethanol, and I think, Juan, you had some pretty tempered comments on the second quarter and maybe for the balance of the year. I mean the margin environment has \u2013 I mean it's not great, but it seems like it's actually modestly better than it was a year ago. The inventory picture and production numbers have been reasonably constructive for the industry in the last few weeks. Could you talk about how you think about ethanol over the balance of the year and some of the puts and takes against that outlook?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Sure. Yes. Of course on the positive side, Adam, we see favorable blending economics both domestically and globally. And that will lead to strong exports. At the beginning of the year, we were probably thinking about 1.8 billion gallons of exports. Now with China, we're probably thinking more in the range of 1.6 billion gallons. So you are right. We are entering the driving season with inventories that are lower than last year, so that is on the positive, but we will see. We'll have to see the strengths of domestic gasoline consumption in the driving season given prices. Prices are kind of creeping up for gasoline, so we'll see how that impact demand.","And we continue to see exports going to Brazil, and as I said, with the exception of China, we export \u2013 I think the industry exported like about 100 million gallons in the first quarter to China, but we're probably estimating 200 million gallons less for the rest of the year. So a lot of volatility and I will say there has been some increase in margins over the recent weeks, but everything will be determined on how do we go through the driving season and the rest of the year. And as I said, there is some optimism in the fact that we're entering the season with a little bit lower inventories on last year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful color. I'll pass it on.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you for the question.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. You certainly talked about some of the structural improvements going on in Argentina to make the crushing market more favorable going forward and also the reduced take-or-pay kind of activity. Can you speak also about farmer selling in Latin America or in Brazil in particular and is there something structurally improving there as well? It would seem to me that they would \u2013 the farmers there would continue to have a pretty good negotiating pattern and perhaps the Argentinian farmers would as well regardless of what's going on with the weather in Argentina. Are these things related to the crushing discipline or is it something separate?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I would say in Argentina, farmer selling remained historically slow. And I think at this point in time, it will continue to do so. We see the farmer has sold \u2013 I mean, has priced about 20% of the crop, which is about 8 million tons. Obviously, it's a smaller crop and prices have come up because the crusher needs to entice the farmer to sell in Argentina at this point in time. But I will say, in Argentina, it's going to be a little bit about interest rates, inflation, devaluation of the peso, and the farmer will be playing with that. So we expect that these carry that to a certain degree \u2013 the government has put into the market will continue to make the Argentine seller a slow seller.","In Brazil, we have seen farmer selling. At this point in time, they price probably about 56% to 60% of their crop versus about 44% a year ago. So we've seen good farmer selling actually in Q1 and during the first weeks of Q2. Rallies in the market and obviously devaluation of the real has brought the farmer to market, so we will have to evaluate how it goes. But so far, the start of the year have played that way.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","But do you see any structural changes in the Brazilian farmers' ability to delay selling or if it's \u2013 or not?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Not any significant change versus last year. No, I would say. No.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Can I ask the last question? Do you have a rough estimate for what animal nutrition's profits are on an annual basis?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I think that when you look at the pro forma, we kind of showed you kind of what last year's number was, which I think was about \u2013 roughly about $20 million. I think you should expect that's going to improve because of the improvements that have been made in the \u2013 particularly the lysine business. We kind of continue to grow that particular business.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, because you have $23 million in first quarter alone, so...","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. So, that's one thing. We should actually expect a pretty strong growth in the animal nutrition business on a calendar year basis compared to 2017.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Rob, the improvement that we've been talking on lysine all these \u2013 for the last year has been significant \u2013 have been significant. And you will see a big acceleration in animal nutrition results over time.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is now open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Wanted to follow up on the oilseed crush questions and just maybe because we've had such a substantial spike in margins, can you guys just talk a little bit about the hedging philosophy on how this works? Like, we're already here into the second quarter. What kind of business is done at these really terrific spot margins versus maybe the team hedged it many months ago for the second quarter at lower margins? I think we're all maybe very interested in that particular point because I think it starts to give us information as to how we think about the profit potential of these businesses as time progresses. I'd also be curious about how you think about hedging Q3 and Q4. Can you even do it? Is there enough liquidity in the market to hedge at this time?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, David. Normally in our oilseeds crush operation, we do run hedges. We do actually try to lock in margins in the future. The degree that we lock in is a function of our outlook \u2013 our perceptions in terms of supply\/demand and how margins move. I mentioned to you that a lot of the timing effects will reverse in the second quarter, so that actually gives you an indication that back in the fourth quarter we did lock into quite a bit of margins related to the second quarter and that will unwind.","The rest of the other 50% that will unwind, that will unwind over the course of third quarter, fourth quarter and a little bit in 2019, so that gives you a sense that we're always going to be hedging more than nearby and then less on the (00:44:07). But as we pointed out, I mean (00:44:11) the mark-to-market, this is actually very good news. And it tells you that the forward margins look very, very healthy. So the fact that we have a lot of that unhedged, we will be able to benefit from that type of margin in the future when we actually execute. And actually, with the higher margins, we are continuing to hedge, so we are putting on more hedges as we kind of go through every quarter.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Do you have good visibility into the back half of the year then because of the margins \u2013 sorry, because of the hedging program? Is it fair to say? I mean would it be north of 50% of the other volumes? Is there any kind of ballpark? I mean I understand proprietary, but we're all struggling here with how we think about the model in Q3, Q4 and a lot of this related just to your strategies on the hedge.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I mean we're not necessarily going to go through the specifics in terms of how much we're going to hedge, but we do \u2013 I mean just the fact I pointed out that we do have some mark-to-market timing effects in Q3, Q4 indicates that we do have hedges out there.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. I'll leave it there on the Oilseeds one. Just a follow-up on ethanol. We do calculate margins here that are actually reasonable. And just can you explain again why \u2013 I didn't understand why you're so \u2013 I don't want to say, I don't know the right word \u2013 concerned is, but it's a year-on-year negative comparison versus the year ago. And the environment here feels good. Did ADM \u2013 again maybe it's a heading question again. Did you guys lock in ethanol business some time ago before we saw the margin structure here lift up?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No. No, David. Maybe the commentary is relative to the other segments. When we were talking about 2018 and how confident we feel about the results being much better than 2017, we see very strong origination comp versus the previous year, and we're going to go up in every segment in origination year-over-year. We see the strengths on Oilseeds, and not only crushing, but also Origination in South America versus the previous year. We think we're going to double-digit growth in Nutrition, and we continue to see very strong sweeteners and starches business.","So my point is the only question mark, if you will, in the environment is the ethanol. And especially, given that the duties that China put will reduce the volume on that. So, coming into the year, we thought very strong export will tip off, if you will, and make the margins expand into ethanol. Now, we're going to have to deal with 200 million gallon less of that. And that's why I've been a little bit more cautious. But probably this is relative to how optimistic we are for the rest of our business, if you will.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. I'll pass it along. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hi, Ann.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Back to \u2013 good morning. Back to Oilseeds, are you running at capacity or do you have room to increase volumes going forward?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","We were running at capacity, I would say, March \u2013 all the way to March. And then April, we started a little bit with maintenance \u2013 with seasonal maintenance in this time of the year. So, that's the dynamic. But before that, we were probably running north of 95%.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And that's global or U.S.?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No. That was U.S.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","U.S. Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about Wilmar? Wilmar is one of the largest crushers in China and it imports most of its beans, I presume that that's through your joint venture. Can you talk about the dynamics and how that relationship might change should the Chinese put a tariff on imported soybeans?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. So, first of all, Wilmar is a very diversified company. It certainly has a big palm oil and tropical operations, and has developed over the last few years a big consumer products business in China. So it is less exposed of \u2013 to soybean crushing than maybe people give them credit for. I would say, if all this U.S.-China trade dispute end up not being resolved, and in June we see 25% duties on beans, I think you will see probably an impact on the volumes of Wilmar crushing because basically China will be buying more expensive beans and soybean meal will become a little bit more expensive and there will be some impact on demand. So I expect capacity utilization to be reduced a little bit. I don't know to what extent. Of course, we know that Brazil exports about give or take 70 million tons of beans and China imports about 100 million tons, so there is a gap there. But at the end of the day, that's the impact we are seeing that potentially will have reduced capacity utilization a little bit in Wilmar.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","It's also important to note that Wilmar is probably one of the most efficient crushers in China. And so, whenever there's going to be more input price pressure, they will on a relative basis do better just due to the fact that they have a very, very efficient cost structure.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up philosophical one, you noted one that part of ADM's vision is to provide better nutrition for consumers. Where do sweeteners and starches fit into that vision or that mission?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. We have a business that has some components of healthy nutrition and we have some parts that are more related to indulgence and fun. So there are some products like high fructose corn syrup that goes into products like carbonated soft drinks that they have a place in nutrition and with moderation they can be consumed as part of our diet. The business as you heard us saying for many, many years has been working on what we call the Fight for the Grind, which has continued to bring other things to do to be produced out of corn and that's why the starches piece of the business continue to grow. So it's part of our portfolio. It may not grow as fast as other parts of the portfolio, but it's part of our portfolio, and it's a healthy part of it.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. I just wanted to circle back to your operational synergies target, and you guys said you might be able to do in excess of $200 million. Could you provide a breakdown a little bit by segment and how much you might be able to exceed that number?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hi, Michael. Listen, I don't have a breakdown of the whole synergies per the four segments, but in general they are very much allocated, if you will, or they can from the size of the assets. So, normally, in every year, corn tends to take about half of everything we save because they have the biggest facilities. I think Oilseeds has done very well this year, and you're going to see maybe 25% from Oilseeds. And then, if you will, the rest of the 25% is split between Nutrition and Ag Services, give or take.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And how much in excess of $200 million do you think \u2013 you said you guys are running ahead of $200 million. I mean how much upside is there?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","It probably may be 10%, 20% upside to that. We were very pleased because, as you know, some of these projects are CapEx-related. And we reduced the amount of CapEx for this year. So we were thinking maybe $200 million will become a difficult target without the ability to do CapEx. But kudos to our operation teams because they look at the pipeline and they found $70 million of run rate with some capital restriction. So we are very pleased about the start of the year and that gives us hope and confidence that we will exceed the $200 million.","We have developed \u2013 this has become part of the culture. We've been doing this for the last five years. And over the last four or five years, we have saved about $1 billion run rate in this operational excellence. And when we think about going forward, Michael, on Readiness in which we are not only looking at performance excellence for our plants, but also for the whole company, we think that the Readiness programs, and that's why we're putting so much emphasis on it, has probably another $1 billion of savings ahead of us and so \u2013 over several years. But we see that that $1 billion that we achieved over the last four years, we have another $1 billion ahead of us. And this start of the year with $70 million run rate in the first quarter give us even more evidence that that is highly achievable.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Great. That was really helpful color. Just shifting gears, maybe you could talk a little bit in terms of WILD Flavors, and I know 2Q is seasonally the strongest period of the year. But as you sort of look out maybe even a little bit more longer term, I mean what type of revenue and EBIT growth rate should we be thinking about over the next couple of years for WILD Flavors?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. So, one of our main tenets (00:54:56) in WILD Flavors is that we are providing natural flavors and second that we are focusing on providing total ingredient solutions. So, that value proposition is resonating very well with customers, and you see that WILD Flavors continued to grow earnings of double digits. Actually, at the moment, I will say in places like Asia Pacific, we are capacity-limited. If not, we will be growing revenue faster. And we are expanding. We're doubling that facility as fast as we can. So, I will say we have \u2013 still, we have untapped potential because we haven't even started playing the level much (00:55:37) in flavor in South America. We are at capacity in Asia Pacific. We are growing about 30% per year from a small base in Africa. So we think again that this transition from just individual flavors or individual products to more solutions is right in our alley and resonating with customers. And we see the potential of double-digit growth for several years ahead of us as we bring more capacity.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Is that double-digit revenue growth or double-digit percentage?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No. I will say double-digit operating profit growth. Revenue growth should be something between 4% and 7% or 8% depending on the area and depending on when do we bring the next capacity. As I said, right now, we're a little bit constrained on capacity. So you see us shifting the mix to more profitable things. That's why you see OP growing faster than revenue. But as soon as we bring some extra capacity, you will see us growing more like in the 7% to 8% revenue.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you very much. That was very helpful.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Welcome, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, as you're going through this better upswing in the commodity cycle and it's helping your Oilseeds and other parts of your businesses, can you talk about your efforts of how much your earnings power should be higher relative to where it would have been just in an upswing because as a point of reference, again as I think was pointed out earlier if you just take the crush margin in terms of your capacity, they didn't seem there's much upside to your operational efficiencies in all the actions that you've taken. So we're trying to figure out what the implications are on your earnings power of all the stuff that you've done and if you can put in some sort of context given the higher commodity cycle?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I mean, Ken, I mean we've talked in the past about how we've been driving earnings improvements over the years. And we've been talking about how we've been, one, driving operational excellence. And so we've seen a lot of benefits from operational excellence. As you know, not all of it flows to the bottom line because we've actually reinvested some of these savings in different initiatives. And secondly, we've talked about growth initiatives. The accretion from recent investments and we're getting a whole lot of that accretion now with these things starting up like Campo Grande and Tianjin. Thirdly, the WILD Flavors was important part of our accretion story, and you're starting to see the traction from WILD Flavors in terms of double-digit growth. And then lastly, we did do quite a few share buybacks over the past couple of years and that's also contributed towards our earnings power.","And so I think we've indicated that over the past couple of years some of the headwinds that kind of mask these improvements, and when you can try to figure out how much of these headwinds cost us, you could easily \u2013 we talked about the fact that these headwinds could be more than $0.50 a share, right, in terms of the impact on us. And so as these headwinds kind of subside and become tailwinds, more like tailwinds, you're going to see strong recoveries particularly in Oilseeds segment. We're actually very optimistic about Oilseeds in terms of what it can deliver as protein demand continues to be strong, as our U.S. operations continue to drive efficiencies. And so we're probably most optimistic in terms of recovery of the base in the Oilseeds business.","In Origination, we're seeing good recoveries right now. As I indicated, we're talking about fundamental improvements in terms of recovery of Origination. But I mean there has been some structural changes. We talked about some of the structural changes that have impacted Origination. And so we're probably never going to get back to the historical ranges in Origination.","Then in Carbohydrates or the former Corn Processing segment, we talked about the fact that we're growing the geographic footprint of that. And so, that's how we're going to be driving earnings power in the Carbohydrates segment as we continue to expand that footprint. And then under the new Nutrition segment, we're very optimistic about that one. We talked about 20%-plus operating profit growth in 2018. This really is one of our key growth segments going forward.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, net-net if you take all the investments that you've made in and then ex out some of the structural, is it a net positive to your earnings power when we see the cycle completely turn or is it a net neutral? How do you think about that? I guess it's just philosophically, and then I mean if you put numbers through, that would be all better, but it does (01:00:32)","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No. I mean philosophically, Ken, it's a net positive. There's no doubt about it. And I think that as we kind of go through this year, I think you're going to start seeing how these earnings power translates into stronger earnings for our company and that's the reason why we're so confident about this particular year.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Ken, I think if you think about how we navigated the down cycle, I think we navigated the down cycle very well and mostly through good execution and great cost position. I do believe that we have the leading cost position in the industry and we will continue to enhance that advantage. What you haven't seen much of it has been the rewards from all the results of all the growth investments. Just because in order to build a plant, it takes you 18 to 24 months, and then it takes you another 12 to 18 months to start making money after you fill it up. So we have a lot of latent earnings power there coming on a stream. And I think you're going to see that in 2019 and 2020.","And we don't stay still. Look at our operational excellence, now then into Readiness, and Readiness is going to drive not only maybe an extra $1 billion of cost, but also revenue growth. And we feel very good how we continue to get better of how do we execute our strategy. I think we will learn it ourselves and our team are getting better on that. And then I think it's paying off to sticking to the strategy because we're becoming better. And every one of these improvements or tweaks that you make, whether this is small realignment of Readiness, it's just another page of the strategy that we are unveiling. But it's because we're getting more comfortable and we've become better. And I think you're going to see that coming into the P&L now that maybe the down cycle subsided a little bit.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens. Your line is now open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Farha.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","A question on Ag Services. You guys highlighted that you have a good export program out of the U.S. going into the second half. Some color on the elevation margins on that export program? And kind of what degree you think we could see growth in that segment this year?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Elevation margins have moved up. I mean that's part of the reason why we took the negative timing effect related to Origination. Beginning of the year, we had about maybe $0.10 forward of elevation margins. They've moved up to about $0.20 to $0.30 right now. So, that's a positive. We are seeing demand out of United States. As we indicated, we had river condition issues at the beginning of the quarter, so it was tough to actually get product down to the Gulf. And secondly, with some challenges down South America, we're seeing customers actually come to us right now in order to source their product. And so overall, we expect the elevation margins to remain robust as we kind of move through the year.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","So in terms of earnings for that segment versus last year or versus historical levels, I mean you earned $900 million in that segment in 2014. Is that a number that's just too big to repeat given the strong export program? And last year, you earned a low of around $585 million. How should we think kind of the earnings power of that segment is today?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I think, Farha, if we maybe recast it into pro forma in terms of our new segment called Origination, right, maybe that's a better way to think through it because that excludes milling. I think how you want to be able to think about it is last year we finished up Origination roughly $400 million, but we also had some favorable benefits in the fourth quarter related to settlements. And so you take out some of the favorable settlement impact, you're probably in the low 300s, like $320 million or so. We don't expect we're going to have these favorable settlements this year. And so the way we kind of look at it is for 2018 Origination, we're going to have strong improvements off that $320 million base.","Now, as Juan indicated, we will take about a $30 million provision in the second quarter related to sorghum, okay? And I kind of view that as kind of a one-off contained in the second quarter. I got to get that behind us. So after you take that into account, then we do expect that Origination will register strong profit improvement versus where we delivered last year.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the added color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. I know we're running really late. I have just a couple of really quick questions. This morning, the focus has really been on your forward book of business for 2018, but \u2013 and there's questions about sustainability, but I've started to see some positive bookings. Your buyers seem to be willing to go out as far as second quarter next year. Is that what you're seeing as well in the market? It seems like we're starting to get even further out building of a book of business.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, Eric. Good morning. Yes, you're right and you heard me saying it before in my comments. So we see that that's a big difference versus last year and the previous year, but prices were coming down. Everybody was destocking and that was an impact on demand that we couldn't see. And then it limits our ability and our optionality to position ourselves better. Now that the market \u2013 the buyers are building the book, that allows us to excel into using all the ADM optionality that we have based on our assets and our different locations. So, yeah, we see that and that's a big positive for us.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes. I certainly see that, too. So then the final question is we've had a meaningful change in the grain market. And I'm just going to use corn as an example where your forward curve on corn is quite positive. You're at $416 million on the harvest (01:07:18) contract. Farmers for the first time in quite some time can sell forward 2018 production above their cost of production. And I suspect that this is meaningfully changing how farmers will go to market \u2013 the speed at which they'll go to market, I would assume that this is going to encourage faster and more selling. What are you hearing from your farmer customers regarding kind of the new pricing environment for grain?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","We haven't heard the significant change at this point in time. Hopefully, this is going to come back to more normal commercialization of the crop during the crop year, but at this point in time, we haven't seen a significant shift.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Eric.

And finally, they will take your questions. Please turn to slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.02, up 79% from the year ago period. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $924 million, up 40% from the second quarter of 2017, and we generated positive EVA with a return on invested capital well above our WACC.","Our team performed exceptionally well, meeting our customers' needs and showing the strength of an increasingly efficient, balanced and global portfolio. We continue to accelerate the execution of our strategic plan, optimizing our core, driving efficiencies and expanding strategically and delivered a series of important accomplishments in the quarter and first half of the year.","In the first six months of 2018, among the businesses we have targeted for improvements, profitability has gone up $150 million, representing about half of our operating profit improvement over the first half of 2017 with Global Trade, lysine and South American origination all contributing to our improved profitability. And we now have completed the divestiture of our Bolivian oilseeds business.","Over the first six months of the year, our operational excellence initiatives have delivered cost savings of more than $150 million on a run rate basis and are on pace to exceed our 2018 target of $200 million. We also continue to execute on the five key growth platforms that can help us grow earnings and returns: Animal Nutrition, Health & Wellness, carbohydrates, human nutrition and taste.","In Animal Nutrition, we announced the proposed acquisition of Neovia last month, which, when completed, will give us a leading global animal nutrition business and a strong platform for future growth. We also opened two new state-of-the-art animal nutrition facilities in the U.S. in the quarter.","In Health & Wellness, we are adding a strong customer channel to our existing R&D capabilities with the announced addition of a leading probiotics company, Protexin. In taste, we announced the acquisition of Rodelle, having a sustainable supply of vanilla products to our industry-leading portfolio of natural-flavored solutions. We also continue to expand our geographic reach in markets that are seeing increasing consumer demand, launching our starches and sweeteners joint venture with Aston Foods in Russia and our oilseeds joint venture with Cargill in Egypt.","Another key to our future success will be advancing our Readiness efforts which we spoke about last quarter. Prior to Readiness, we largely focused improvement efforts within individual businesses and units and functions to make sure they set the competitive standard in their fields. But there are more opportunities to make ourselves even better by looking across the entire company. That's what Readiness is about, driving standardization and the sharing and leveraging of best practices across ADM to build the very best company. Readiness will help the company in two fundamental ways. First, it will boost our ongoing operational excellence and efficiency efforts. And second, it will liberate resources to focus on growth. We are moving very quickly on these efforts.","We've completed our assessment phase and we're now into implementation. More and more colleagues around the globe are engaging in the effort. Our teams are already identifying individual initiative that will help drive improvement and we have created a governance structure to ensure that the changes we make lead to sustainable, lasting impacts. We are excited about Readiness and we see great potential to drive future earnings power and build a great and enduring company.","Later on this call, I will discuss the outlook for our business but now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.02, up significantly from the $0.57 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $924 million, up $266 million from the year ago quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 13%, down from approximately 28% in the prior year, due mainly to U.S. tax reform, which reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter that impacts our overall calendar year rate and certain favorable second quarter discrete tax items. We expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 16% and 18%.","Looking beyond 2018, we would expect an ongoing effective tax rate to be between 17% and 20%. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 7.3% is more than 100 basis points above our 2018 annual WACC of 6.25% that's generating positive EVA of approximately $275 million.","On chart 16 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1 per share to adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share. For this quarter, we had $0.02 per share credit related to LIFO, a $0.03 per share charge related to impairments and restructurings and a $0.01 per share charge related to discrete tax items.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate lines. In the Other segment, results increased on stronger ADM Investor Services earnings due to higher short-term interest rates. In the Corporate lines, net interest expense for the quarter was down largely due to a lower tax-related interest expense and interest income related to a tax credit. Unallocated corporate costs of $180 million were up versus the prior year due to higher accruals for performance-related compensation in light of a more favorable financial outlook for the calendar year.","Turning to our cash flow statement on slide 6. We generated $1.1 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first six months of the year, slightly higher than the prior year. As we mentioned last quarter, we made investments in inventory as favorable carries in the market and the willingness of growers to sell their crops presented opportunities for us to take on a greater ownership position earlier in the year.","Total capital spending in the first six months was $379 million, in line with our expectation for the year. We returned approximately $379 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Therefore, we again had a balanced approach towards capital spending, return of capital to shareholders.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. Our balance sheet remains solid. Our operating working capital of $7.7 billion was up approximately $700 million versus the year-ago period, with about one-half related to prepayments to South American farmers for spot grain purchases, stemming from the recent Brazilian trucker strike, which delayed our ability to take physical delivery immediately.","Total debt was about $7.6 billion, resulting in a net debt balance of $6.8 billion. We finished the quarter with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%, in line with the year-ago quarter. Our shareholders' equity of $18.7 billion was up from the $17.4 billion last year primarily due to net earnings in excess of dividends and share repurchases. We had $6.1 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to $7 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next I'll discuss our business segment performance for the quarter on slide 8. In the second quarter, we earned $924 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, up from the $658 million in last year's second quarter. Looking at the first half of the year, adjusted operating profit was $1.6 billion, up 23% from the prior year.","Now, I'll review the performance of each segment. On slide 9, Origination results were up significantly over the second quarter of 2017. Merchandise and handling was up substantially year-over-year. The short crops in South America, as well as increased purchases from that region by China in anticipation of tariffs offered motivation for other buyers to come to the U.S. The result was significantly higher volumes and margins for corn, wheat and soybean exports. The team also managed risks extremely well, resulting in solid basis gains during the quarter and the business benefited from the reversal of some timing effects from the prior quarter, which was accelerated compared to our assessment at the time of our first quarter earnings call.","Global Trade continued its progress as its execution and diversified earnings base favorably contributed results. The team executed particularly well during the China sorghum situation, making swift and smart decisions to mitigate some of the negative impacts which, as a result, turned out to be a bit smaller than we expected on our last call.","Ocean freight was up for the quarter and destination marketing volumes continue to grow. Volumes should be more than 19 million metric tons this year, nearly double the 10 million metric tons in 2014. Transportation was significantly higher, driven by increased volumes as U.S. waterways returned to more normal conditions.","Transportation also benefited from ARTCO's growing business in backhaul freight and stevedoring, the latter of which has become a significant contributor to ARTCO's overall business. In fact, our stevedoring, trucking and warehousing businesses all turned in record profits for a second quarter.","I'd like to note the growth in destination marketing and stevedoring particularly. These are examples of the great job the Origination team is doing to invest in changes that are structural in nature and help to diversify and provide more stable earnings for the Origination business.","Now, to slide number 10. Oilseeds' results were also significantly higher versus the second quarter of 2017. The Crushing and Origination business did a great job, delivering on continued strong global demand for soybean meal. Around the globe, the team ran our assets hard, setting a second-quarter record in crush volumes amid a very favorable soy crush margin environment.","In South America, high Brazilian origination volumes and improved margins, largely driven by a more aggressive farmer selling and robust demand from China, contributed to strong results. And the team managed well through the Brazilian trucker strike, limiting its impact on results. The expected reversal of timing impacts from the first quarter and new negative timing effects at the end of the second quarter resulted in a net positive. Execution was also strong in RPBO, which was higher year-over-year as our value-added businesses continued their growth.","We saw solid margins and strong volumes in our refined and specialty oils businesses, with North American refined oils delivering a great performance on higher volumes. Those results were partially offset by weaker earnings in Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts. Asia was lower on Wilmar results.","On slide 11, Carbohydrate Solutions results were down modestly versus the second quarter of 2017. There's another important execution story to tell here. In the second quarter, we identified some important upgrades we needed to make at our Decatur corn complex to ensure it continues to set the competitive standard for wet mills.","We had some downtime which resulted in higher manufacturing costs which will again in the second half of this year as we advance this work. Our teams have managed exceptionally well around the impacts of those upgrades. In fact, outside of Decatur, manufacturing cost improvements in Carbohydrate Solutions business has been coming in ahead of our projections, helping to partially offset the cost of the downtime.","Starches and sweeteners was down versus the prior year period. Fundamentally, the underlying starches and sweeteners business is solid. North American liquid sweeteners were in line with the year-ago period, with volumes comparable to last year. Absent the downtime, our North American starches and sweeteners results would have been up versus the prior year. Globally, starch volumes and dried sweetener margins were strong in the quarter, leading to good performance.","The end of the EU sugar regime and the delay in the implementation of the lifting of the quotas in Turkey negatively impacted results in European liquid sweeteners, partially offset by contributions from our Chamtor acquisition.","Flour milling was impacted by some negative timing effects that will reverse in the coming quarters and lower volumes in our Caribbean operations. Bioproducts results were down primarily on lower ethanol production volumes and higher costs due to the already mentioned plant downtime. Execution margins for ethanol were lower versus the prior year.","On slide 12, Nutrition delivered 7% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and more than 20% operating profit growth over the year-ago period. WFSI earnings were up substantially versus the second quarter of 2017 with all three businesses: Specialty Ingredients, WILD Flavors and Health & Wellness delivering improved sales and results year-over-year. Specialty Ingredients benefited from improved volumes and margins in proteins, higher margins in emulsifiers and increased contributions from fibers. New customer business and improved portfolio mix boosted sales and margins in WILD Flavors. And Health & Wellness group delivered good results, led by margin improvements in bioactives. Animal Nutrition results were higher year-over-year, driven by stronger performances in lysine, as well as in pet premix and treats. These results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating well with our customers as they address consumer needs.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to slide 13. Looking ahead for each of our businesses, in Origination, we expect higher results for the third quarter versus the same period in 2017 despite the faster reversal of the timing impacts. For the year, the continued impact of the short crops in South America and growing contributions from some of our more value-added businesses like destination marketing and stevedoring should continue to support strong performance. We expect Origination to have a very strong calendar year 2018, well above our expectations at the beginning of the year.","In Oilseeds, we expect third quarter results to be substantially higher than the third quarter of 2017, as the team continues to deliver strong crush volumes in a robust soybean crush margin environment. For the full year, we should continue to see the benefits of good execution amid underlying global demand growth and strong soybean crush margins, along with continued higher volumes and steady results from RPBO. In summary, we expect our Oilseeds operations to deliver excellent results this year, significantly higher than our expectations at the beginning of the year.","In Carbohydrate Solutions, the team has done a good job managing through the upgrades indicator. Fundamentally, the North American starches and sweeteners business is solid. Although sugar prices remain depressed in some of our European markets, our new Russian joint venture will begin contributing to results.","Ethanol industry inventories could build if China does not reenter the market, putting some risks on margins. For both the third quarter and the calendar year due to weaker results from the ethanol business, we expect Carbohydrate Solutions to be lower than last year.","In Nutrition, we expect continued sales growth and favorable product mixes in WFSI to contribute to good results. We'll see the benefits of our Protexin and Rodelle acquisitions as we complete the transactions. We're excited about Neovia. We are moving forward on our integration planning. And while our fourth quarter timeline for closing means we don't expect Neovia to significantly contribute to results this year, we're looking forward to the significant opportunities it presents.","So, for both the third quarter and the full year, we continue to expect Nutrition revenue and results to be significantly higher than last year with a 20% plus growth in OP for the full year. So, when you look at the totality of our actions on our results, our team is executing well. We continue to make our businesses stronger. We're excited about the promise of readiness as those efforts accelerate. We're investing in our growth platforms, our risk management is strong and global demand remains robust.","Naturally, we are monitoring the U.S. China trade situation closely, and are prepared for various potential outcomes. We believe the situation is manageable in the near term and we are confident of delivering solid execution and strong results.","Sitting where we are today, our outlook for profitability and returns for the 2018 calendar year is more favorable than it was when we spoke on our first quarter call. And I remain confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and create shareholder value in 2018 and beyond.","With that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow everyone an opportunity. Your first question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you and good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, David.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Congratulations on the very strong results. I wanted just to ask a couple of things in Oilseeds. First, the mark-to-market that you mentioned, the net effect, Ray, could you give us a little bit of detail there? And what I'm really trying to understand is how we're supposed to model this kind of in the back half of the year. So, I think, there would have been a sizable mark-to-market \u2013 negative mark-to-market on June 30. But, I think, as you mentioned in the script, you netted against the piece that reverses that was marked on the first quarter and you got a net positive. But can you give us some guidance here on how to think about this in Q3, Q4?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Sure thing, David. So, we did indicate at the first quarter call, we had about $110 million of negative mark-to-market that will reverse, and then approximately half would reverse in the second quarter, and the other half would be in the back half of the year and a little bit in 2019. So, what we did realize was the benefit of the reversal in the second quarter. We did have, as a result of the board crush moving up at the end of the quarter, we did have some additional negative mark-to-market, so roughly about $40 million net because we had some higher negative mark-to-markets on soy, but we had some positive mark-to-markets on quinoa. So, when you net it all together, it's roughly $40 million there.","So, how you may want to think about that is when you think about the amount that's still to be reversed from the first quarter and additional $40 million, there is a little over $90 million to reverse over the rest of the year. And that's going to be primarily over third and fourth quarters, a little bit in early 2019 as well. So, that's how you should be thinking about that, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then staying on Oilseeds, industry margins, crush margins, are great. And certainly the profitability here in the quarter was very good, but it's still quite substantially away from previous records that we've seen in Oilseeds on a quarterly basis from prior years. With that kind of setup, can you guys give us your expectations of how sustainable the results that we're seeing in Oilseeds are at these types of levels on a go-forward basis? What visibility do you have?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Well, David, I think we are, as I said in my comments, very optimistic and very confident about the sustainability of the results and the strength of the business. Not only crush margins are very strong, but demand is very strong. We're seeing demand needing to be \u2013 we're seeing supply needed to be maybe 10 million tons higher year-over-year just to cover demand. And we're seeing buyers coming back to the market and building a forward book, which is increasing our confidence that we can have visibility in the forward book going forward. So, resiliency in demand growth and buyers coming back to build a book gives us a lot of confidence moving forward.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And, Ray, can you kind of chime in and talk to us about earnings power? So, just kind of tie everything together with Juan's comments about visibility and sustainability and how it results then in earnings power for ADM and that's it for me, guys.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I mean, David, as Juan indicated in his comments, we believe that the improvements that we're demonstrating in 2018 represent really a culmination of a lot of the efforts that we've been driving over the past couple of years. So, the improvements that we're making across all of our businesses is going to continue to drive significant earnings in the future.","You layer on top of that the fact that the environment that we're experiencing right now, and particularly, short crops around the world, stock-to-use ratios coming down and global demand for protein continues to be strong. It creates an environment whereby effectively, the margin environment in our businesses are returning back to a more normal level, which is important as we think about future earnings.","And then lastly, add on top of that, the investments that we've made both on an organic basis, whether they be like Campo Grande, Tianjin or the pea protein plants that we're actually constructing right now and finishing off. And the investments in acquisitions that we've recently announced in the second quarter, that's also going to add towards the earnings power of this company. So, when you actually take a look at all three aspects of the significant work that we've done to improve the company, the work that the environment, the business environment returning back to a more normal level, and then the investments that we've made, we feel very confident that the earnings going forward over the medium term, are going to continue to grow. And more importantly, we're going to be driving returns.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Your line is open.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning. Nice quarter.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Heather.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Heather. Thank you.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","So, I just have one question related to the Brazilian freight issue, but it has three parts. I just wonder if you could give us a sense of how this is currently impacting your entire business there. If you have any sense of when this is going to be resolved and how you're positioning ADM to minimize any potential impact or actually maybe benefit from that disruption?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I'd say a couple of comments. We indicated that the impact to-date has been minimal. In fact, the way you would want to think about it is like a single-digit negative impact. So, in the whole scheme of our Oilseeds operations, it was not material and that's the reason why we're not calling it out.","Currently, how we're managing it is because of the uncertainty on the tariffs, we're actually negotiating in the short-term. It really is we're negotiating freight rates with the truckers based upon our current needs and that's how we're operating right now.","Now, when this is going to get resolved, as you probably appreciate, I mean, there's going to be a judge who's going to be looking at the potential rulings in terms of what the tariffs are. Expectation is sometime in August.","I think, leading up to that, I think everyone in the industry is going to remain fairly negotiating freight rates in the short term. I don't think anyone's going to go long term in terms of the freight rates just due to the exposures. But we're actually pretty confident that the final resolution would be something that will result in effectively a tariff structure very similar to, like what the market was before. And so, at this point in time we're monitoring, we're managing the situation carefully. And, again, up to now, we've been managing this situation quite well.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","And I think, Heather, if I may add, at the beginning when this hit us, certainly freights in \u2013 freight to Barcarena were higher than the table so we continue to do business there. And, of course, Barcarena, being our newest port, takes a lot of our volume. And also, Paranagu\u00e1 as well, the freights in the south were also higher than the table.","So, we managed to do those, but it's true that in the rest of \u2013 for the rest of the operations, it put some caution in the activities, of course, because you can only go with third parties that you've been working for many, many years and we negotiate these one-on-one deals so.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. My follow-up is on China-U.S., I appreciate you all, the comments that you provided. Just today, based upon our incomings, the conventional wisdom seems that this is negative for U.S. elevation. But to your point about tightening balance sheets around the world for wheat and corn, et cetera, is there any way that that conventional wisdom could be incorrect and global flow shift and move to the U.S. and margins actually come in stronger because of the dislocations against the backdrop of tighter stock.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Of course, we're looking at that. Weather around the world has turned drier and production at the moment is being adjusted down. So, that will bring demand for corn and wheat certainly into the U.S. And all the way to July, we have still seen good soybean demand coming to the U.S. given the prices we have. So, you could construct a scenario in which maybe there is a overlap of wheat, corn and maybe some soybean, and tightening up elevation margins in the U.S.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","Awesome. Thank you so much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome, Heather.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. I guess just this is kind of a follow-up to Heather's question. You know, when you look at the disruption that this tariff environment has caused, I think just net-net it's a surprise to see U.S. exports so strong in a quarter like this. And I know it's also related to drought in Argentina. Is there any way to kind of separate these two factors out and give us a little more help on the benefits that you receive just from the drought in South America? But also there must have been some benefits from satisfying China's demand that might have, I guess, spilled over into other countries. Were you satisfying the demand from other countries that were then satisfying China? And is that the nature of some of these dislocations? Thanks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Good morning, Rob. Of course, we've reported higher volumes in Origination in this quarter. Ad listen, I think it's difficult to chop all those results into pieces, to be honest. I think, it's a combination of higher volumes, lower costs. The business has been driving efficiencies for the last few years and more efficient global trade operations with trading activities that leverage the supply chain, and something that has been very important when we have these discontinuities has been boots on the ground, the ability that we have to read markets and adjust quickly now with our destination marketing efforts, with more people around the world, with better coordination, that has all resulted into this.","Ray, in his remarks, also mentioned about the impact that destination marketing, stevedoring and other new businesses than Origination have had on our results. This has moved these results from about 3% and 5% of our profits a few years ago to now representing about 30% of our profits. So, I would say it's a combination of taking advantage of good cyclical conditions, but also a structural improvement that we have made in the business that make us confident about calling 2018 a very strong year compared to 2017 for Origination business.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Can you give us a little more help on the back half for the Origination division? I mean, you've had years where, I guess, the back half could be $400 million in profit. It could be even more. Is this setting up to be an outstanding back half for Origination like over $400 million? Is there any way to contextualize that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. It is a little bit a continuation of what I explained to Heather. So, I stated in my remarks we expect Q3 to be much higher than last year Q3. Regarding Q4, we will have to see how basically soybean demand comes into the U.S. We know the U.S. will be competitive in wheat and corn given the short crop in the rest of the world. The issue will be how much of the soybean volume continues to come into the U.S.","As I said to what we have today, July was still strong in demand. We will have to see for the rest of the year. But that will \u2013 basically, that will depend on the soybean demand into the U.S., will depend how much elevation margins pop in Q4. So, we could have either a good Q4 or a spectacular Q4 depending on that happening. Too early to call, to be honest, Rob, at this point.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Could we talk about 2019 a bit? Juan, you sounded very confident about your ability to grow earnings in 2019. Could you highlight kind of key businesses that you expect to deliver growth into next year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. Thank you, Farha. I think about our strategy and how we've been continuing to deliver on that. And we think about optimizing the core, and despite the progress we have made in what we call the improvement businesses, we still have opportunities there, and there are some businesses that are still not realizing their potential. So, we still see improvements in our businesses and our ability to execute. We're very happy the way the business execute, but there's always more that we can do. So, we feel good about that.","The efficiencies when we think about the program we have put over all these years to improve the cost of the company, now we are evolving into Readiness, and we feel very, very good. We are in the first stages of Readiness. We're 10 weeks into \u2013 10 days into phase 2, if you will. But everything we look, it makes us even more comfortable that there are more savings that we have said before. And then we have all the expansions that we have done, Farha. If you think about, we are building or we have built five plants between what we have in China, pea protein, specialty proteins in South America, color in Berlin.","So, we have five plants that we have built, we have profit nothing so far, that will all hit the P&L in 2019. And then, we have all these acquisitions that we have made all the way from Biopolis and Crosswind and Neovia and Protexin and Rodelle that they all will be accretive, part of them in 2018, but fully in 2019.","So, when we see the businesses having a solid prospect, all of them, into 2019, plus the Readiness efforts, plus our improvement efforts, plus these five new plants, plus five acquisitions coming to the P&L, I cannot feel anything but optimistic about 2019, to be honest.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's very helpful. And any kind of additional color you can give us on the Readiness program? I don't think we've had really a good understanding of the earnings that that Readiness program can deliver for ADM near term and long term.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. I would say, we haven't told you yet about the details of Readiness and mostly because we've been in the assessment phase, if you will, of it. So, we estimated, I said it in the previous quarter, it could be in the $1 billion range over a number of years. We will come with more precision in the next earnings call because we are, as I said, in these 10 days into the second phase, which is more the quantification of all these.","So, we have put \u2013 fundamentally, if you think about what it is, is I always focus the business on to setting the competitive standard by business. So, looking at each business individually vertically and making them the best they can be.","Now, we're taking a more horizontal look at the company, if you will. And we're looking at what are those activities that are best in class in ADM that we can leverage across. If we can share that knowledge and share that and leverage that best-in-ADM performance across the company. So, we have more than 500 people engaged in this and being trained.","Those people are starting to generate initiatives. We have more than a thousand initiatives identified, and now we're putting numbers to those initiatives. So, we will be able to have for you in the next earnings call a description of what we expect from a cash impact on cost, from a cash impact also on revenue, and even on CapEx efficiencies as we move forward. So, we should be able to share with you in the next quarter all that. And as I said, all that is being prepared as we speak in the company.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks for the added color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ann. Can you hear us?","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","(40:33) fundamentals in the oilseeds industry. If we look at the fall in hog prices in the last couple of weeks, it suggests that there may be trouble brewing ahead domestically. And then if you could address the crush margins in China currently and the impact that that might have on your own business and Wilmar? Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Ann, the first part, we didn't hear you. You were talking about China specifically in the first part in the hog industry?","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. Hog prices in the U.S. have collapsed in the last couple of weeks, so just wondering if that industry, if meal demand isn't peaking in the U.S.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Sure, yes. So, let me start with the China thing and then we'd go back to the U.S. So, we've seen recently demand for, in the hog industry, or profitability in the hog industry recovered a little bit in China. There's still below cost, but better than before mostly due to the lack of imports. So, that's helping a little bit.","In terms of crush margins in China, of course, they've been subdued although they remain healthy, but in the range to $10 to $15 per ton, something like that. So, mill base is still in a carry in China and demand as such is a little bit sluggish at this point in time.","In terms of Wilmar, being a board member, I shouldn't predict anything about their results, of course. But let me remind you that Wilmar is a very diversified company into not only palm oil and sugar, but also in consumer products. So, not only they are very astute of how to play the China crushing margins in terms of risk management, but also a very diversified company. So, that's probably to the extent that I should speak about Wilmar margins.","And in terms of protein in the U.S.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I think, Ann, a couple observations, I mean demand for protein in United States remains strong and, actually, globally remains strong for animal protein. And so, we're seeing solid growth in 2018. Part of it's actually due to prices. The fact that prices have come down has actually stimulated demand. We're seeing like in 2019 our forecast for animal protein is going to go up roughly 2% for poultry, pork and beef. From ADM's perspective, this is good since demand for feed is going to continue to be strong. And our estimate for global soybean meal growth right now in 2019 ex-China is about 4% to 5% growth, and that's solid growth.","We recognize that in United States that there is some adjustments in terms of some prices. I mean we've also read about maybe some increases in terms of frozen meat stocks. But when we actually look at the numbers, the increases are not that dramatic relative to what we've seen in history, especially when you look at it as a percentage of consumption or a percentage of export.","So, from our perspective, given strong global economies, strong demand, we're seeing that our outlook in the medium term for soybean meal demand remains very solid, especially given the fact that it is one of the most competitive rations for feed because of its protein content there.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And are you seeing any changes or hearing any changes from farmers and farmers' willingness to sell right now, or going into fall when they harvest given all of the uncertainty around China trade tariffs and NAFTA, et cetera. Is there any change to the way that farmers are behaving yet or is it too early to tell?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Not at this point, Ann. I mean, probably they are all looking at Labor Day to try to get more clarity about the support program that the Ag Secretary has established . So, I think that that would probably define a little bit their pattern going forward.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll get back in line. Thanks for the clarification.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe ground we haven't covered in Carbohydrate Solutions, a little bit of color around some of the moving pieces in the quarter and then the outlook. First, can you maybe provide a little comment on the upgrades you're making at the cater both for \u2013 as is it relates to sweetener and starch products, as well as on the ethanol side, kind of how big the impact was in the quarter and what that looks like for the balance of the year. And then I have a follow-up on the sweetener outlook.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, Adam. I think, for the quarter, the approximate impact on our results is about $15 million of which about two-thirds of the impact was on bioproducts products and a third of the impact on the starches or sweetener side. As we indicated, these are upgrades to both electrical and mechanical infrastructures in the complex. It's going to require us probably through the second half of this year to complete it. Our estimation in terms of potential impact on the second half could be in the neighborhood of about $20 million to $25 million in terms of impact relative to last year.","And again, similarly, about two-thirds of it will be impacting the bioproducts segment. And a third will be the starches and sweeteners segment. So that's our best guess at this point. And naturally as we kind of go through the upgrades, if we discover something else, then we'll have to address it at that point in time.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just on the sweeteners outlook broadly, I mean, are you seeing \u2013 have you seen any change in trend on the volume side from any of your major customers? I know that you commented that the U.S. business was still on track. Is there any concern rising about 2019 at this point or do you think that some of capacity rationalization that has been announced in the industry could save off any pricing or margin pressure there?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No, we're not seeing any change. In fact, what's interesting is when we actually look at total demand for non-sucrose sweeteners, so we're looking at dextrose, fructose and glucose, when you look at the trend lines here in United States since 2010, it's actually stabilized at about 25 billion pounds of consumption. And we've actually seen growth in the glucose syrups in both beverage applications and nonfood applications, and that's kind of offset some of the decline in some of the other areas. So, what's really encouraging is that the demand profile in the U.S. industry for non-sucrose sweeteners is actually very stable. And with the \u2013 with supply-demand balances remain tight, we remain pretty optimistic over the medium term for this business here.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just the issue that you highlighted in Europe, I mean, is that something that you see pressure continuing into the balance of the year, or is it fairly contained in the quarter?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think, we may still see some pressure as we kind of move through the year, and we'll just have to work with the associations and the government in order to kind of get the quotas lifted.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Ray, just to follow-up on sort of the conversation on 2019, you obviously sound very confident, and a lot of it is attributed to a number of items, five or six different items that are within your control, the acquisitions and the cost work you're doing. But I just want to make sure I understand, are you \u2013 you're talking about full-year 2019 in your segments. So you expect to have growth in all segments. And I guess sort of doing the math on what sounds like you're saying the back half of the year is going to look like, are we talking about 2019 from an EPS perspective that's going to be north of $3.50 and potentially approaching $4, and I know you don't want to give guidance but can you just kind of talk us out of some things, if possible?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're right. I'm not going to give any guidance here in terms of 2019. What we're saying is that when we look at the overall drivers of our business in terms of things that we can control, the actions that we're taking. The general business environment that we're seeing across many of our industries, both the Origination side, the Crush side, the Nutrition side, and then the investments that we put in, we feel good about 2019 because when you think about the algorithm for earnings growth in 2019 it will include improvements, actions that we've taken. It will include the fact that the general business environment remains solid, and it will include the accretion in earnings related to investments. And then this new layer on top of that which Juan has indicated, the Readiness initiatives which we'll quantify as we get towards the next earnings call. When you add all together in terms of this algorithm, it points toward solid earnings growth in the future.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, is that another way of saying then as you look at your results and how the business has performed year-to-date and what you expect over the balance of the year that what you're attributing to the disruption from the South American drought and whatever has happened from a tariff perspective which \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong, but I sort of think this tariff is good for you, that those impacts are not actually as large as maybe they appear. And so therefore, there isn't as much of a lapping issue next year as one might think?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think, the underlying business fundamentals and the actions that we're taking are actually pretty significant in terms of the contributions to our overall results here.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hey, Ken.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I just want to circle back on two issues. One is can you discuss the pricing opportunities and market share gains that you might be able to generate from the plant closure in high-fructose corn syrup from a competitor?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Well, I guess, Ken. I mean, from our perspective, it's all about supply and demand balances. And so, as I indicate, the general environment for demand for non-sucrose sweeteners is solid here in North America and we've seen that over the \u2013 since 2010. And with supply-demand balances remaining tight, I guess what we've indicated this year is we should be able to maintain the type of margins that we've had in the past.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, you'd \u2013 to be fair, you'd expect pricing to be higher next year and be able to maintain your margins on the corn side as well. Is that fair?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","All I'm saying, Ken, just like we provided guidance for 2018, we're saying that we should be able to maintain our margins in this business.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Do you expect to see some market share gains?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Well, I mean, it's \u2013 we'll have to determine how the volume gets spread out, right? And with the closure of one of the plants in our industry, we'll have to determine how that volume gets spread out.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then my other question is, look, everybody is talking about the tops of different markets here, but ethanol is just kind of at the bottom and kind of at that horrible level of profitability. Can you talk about how the industry kind of evolves over the next call it 12 to 24 months? What are the key factors that you see and have we reached the leveling off on the bottom? And is there a potential for 2019 to actually show some reasonable return on capital?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","What's interesting is on the demand side for domestic ethanol, we're going to have some marginal improvements just due to the fact that gasoline consumption will go up a little bit. U.S. economy is strong. So you're going to see some marginal growth in domestic demand. On the export side, we all know China stopped buying ethanol after the first quarter. Nevertheless, we think exports would still be around 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion gallons in 2018 calendar year.","As we move forward, I mean, on the assumption that the U.S.\/China trade situation will get resolved \u2013 and I think most of us believe, at some juncture, that will get resolved \u2013 there is a strong probability that China will come in to buy U.S. ethanol as part of their E10 mandate for \u2013 or their E10 policy for 2020. So, when you look over the medium term, we are constructive that incremental demand from China will tighten up supply-demand balances in the U.S. ethanol industry and that should allow us to expand margins as an industry towards more normal levels.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So the crux of the outlook for ethanol you think hinges on China, not on any other key components? And then I'll leave it there.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I mean China is going to be an important factor in the overall evolution of the ethanol margins in the industry here.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Michael?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hi, Michael.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Can you hear me?","Operator","You're line is open. We can hear you know.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. We can hear you. Thank you.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Sorry. Hi. Just wanted to dive a little deeper into Nutrition. I wanted to see \u2013 this year, I think you said that you're looking for about 20% operating income growth this year and that's even before the impact of some of these recent acquisitions. As we look into 2019, is that kind of a sustainable growth rate or what are some of the factors we should be considering there?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, thank you, Michael. The performance of the Nutrition platform continues to be strong across all the businesses to be honest. Flavors was very strong this quarter and we continue to make inroads in that area. Specialty proteins is coming back which it was a little bit down the last couple of years and we're bringing Campo Grande, one of the largest plants in the world into operations. Emulsifiers has been showing growth. Fiber has been showing growth as you know we all need to consume a little bit more of that. Health & Wellness has been growing spectacularly, although from a relatively small base right now. And Animal Nutrition has been showing also a lot of strength out of some strength in lysine but also some new products into the portfolio.","So, when you add all these on a platform that is basically in its formation at this point in time, when you add the power of Neovia bringing global distribution channel to these, when you add the power of Rodelle giving us back integration into vanilla and more access to growing our vanilla business and when you look at Protexin giving us a commercial channel and an ability to produce more probiotics that are so much in demand. We feel very strong that these kinds of rates will continue into the future. So, I think we are just seeing the beginning of all these platforms.","And to be honest, Michael, I'm also excited about the future promise that advances in biology and genomics will bring to the nutrition and health industry. So, Health & Wellness is still the smallest of our segments here in Nutrition, but I think the promise of all the disruption technologies that we're seeing there, bodes very well for this platform for the years to come, so.","And as I think, as Ray said in his remarks, we're seeing the power of our value proposition resonating in our customers, so we're seeing also in the EBITDA margin, on sales that we have in this product, but also in the revenue growth in the products, so we feel very good about it.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Terrific. And then if we could just turn back to Origination here. In terms of the destination marketing, I think you said you're on pace to potentially double your volumes up to 19 million metric tons. Can you give us some sort of long-term growth rate there in terms of what \u2013 either for 2019 or longer term, how big you think that market can get from a volume perspective? And how did those margins compare to kind of your historical margins here in the U.S.?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. When we started with these, if you recall, we said that we were taking products to the final customers in about 15% of our portfolio when we started like in 2014 and we said that our goal was going to double that percentage, if you will. So, the beginning efforts were basically buying companies like Medsofts or industry centers or building our own capabilities on the ground. We did that, and with that, the volume grew. The volume grew from 10 million tons to, like, 19 million tons, where we are right now. The margins have been growing. The margin has basically doubled versus when we started. So versus the maybe $2 per ton we may be in $5 per ton or something in that range. We're still short of the $8 per ton that we wanted because basically in some of these places we were buying share or we were building the positions.","So, I will say you're probably going to see a slight maybe deceleration of the volume growth and more concentration in picking up the margins now, the margin part of that. But profitability has improved significantly in that business and the contribution of that business plus stevedoring, plus fertilizer, plus other businesses to the overall Origination business, as I said before, has moved from about 5% of the total to 30% of the total, which make us feel very good about the prospects of the business here.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Terrific. That was really helpful. I'll pass it on.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, everybody. Good morning. Very nice quarter, guys.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Eric. Good morning.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, my first question comes down to this. Now that we've got some grain price volatility back in the market, Juan and Ray, we've kind of talked about trading profits being one of the things in Origination that is probably structurally going to be lower over time given the fluidity of information that everybody has access to these days. Is that proving to be the case here? And then, will your destination margins be able to replace, maybe more than fully replace that sort of structural dislocation in trading profitability?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you for the question, Eric. We've been adjusting to these new realities, if you will, over the last three or four years. And it's been a job that started with Joe's administration and has transpired now into Stefano's administration. The Global Trade desk, for example, the Global Trade operations has focused basically our activities now more on trading activities that leverage the supply chain. Think about this, for example. In 2014 or 2015, about 5% of the volume was ADM volume for the Global Trade. Today, that represents about 65%. So, it took some restructuring. It took some changes of people, changes of facility, changes of incentives, but now we are much more integrated in moving and leveraging our ADM footprint.","So, I think that that's why you're seeing more consistency of results. That's where you're going to see a better results from this business. Think about again, we face the quarter with the prospect of already $30 million losses in the sorghum side, which turned out to be a little bit lower because the team executed very well. But still the business managed to be relatively comparable to last year's even despite taking that headwind. So it gives you an idea how well they're performing. And it's not just on the positions they take, but it's also the rationalization of some of the assets they made, the increased efficiency. Think about that they capped SG&A by metric ton \u2013 per metric ton by half basically since 2013.","So I think the business have done a lot of improvements that make us more comfortable that not only we're going to be able to jump with the same agility we had before into discontinuities, but also the results will be more robust and hopefully more consistent than we've been in the past. So we feel very good about that business.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Good. And then, my final question, a lot of my questions have been answered. Translating all of your comments here this morning, you've taken hundreds of millions of dollars of costs out of your business the last several years. And arguably, a bunch of that money never really showed up to the bottom line because the business was facing a lot of headwinds. We all know about those headwinds which are reversing pretty nicely right now. So, when I look at your return on invested capital, I think now your rolling 12 months is 7.3%. If you look at the current quarter and maybe Ray you can help me with this number, I think you're well above that 200 basis points, now this is just the current quarter. That 200 basis points spread that you want to achieve over WACC which I believe is still 6%. And when I look at the structural changes in your company and look at your potential for return on invested capital, I can only think that there's upside to that. And is there a reason why we shouldn't be even more encouraged with maybe 8% or greater ROIC in the next one to two to three years? How should we look at your returns?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Eric, we will continue to be focused on returns and we will continue to be driving. That's the sole focus of our strategy is to grow returns to grow EVA. So, as we bid targets we will continue to drive forward.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of David Katter with Baird. Your line is open.","David Katter - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, David.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, David.","David Katter - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I'll keep it quick. Just on optimizing the core, I know you guys completed the Bolivian divestiture this quarter. How should we think about other areas where you might see divestitures or opportunity to rationalize your portfolio?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, David. I think that we're getting to the end of the sizable pieces. There are always going to be optimization because we're always looking at an elevator here and another small plant there, but I would say from a divestiture perspective, we're probably at the end of the big announcement, if you will.","David Katter - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Understood. And maybe along the same lines, in the Nutrition business, I know you guys have a lot of M&A to digest. How should we think about your capacity and\/or willingness to make more bolt-ons moving forward, and what does the acquisition environment look like there?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I think we've been disciplined in the medium size ones that we always take some time to digest. If you remember, we made the WILD Flavors acquisition in October 2014 and we have Neovia now in mid-2018. So, we give ourselves some time.","In terms of bolt-ons, we have capacity to incorporate them. So, in that sense, we will continue to be active. You heard of us saying that we felt the environment was relatively expensive to some properties and that way we've been prudent and we've been relatively subdued in this space. To the extent that we find opportunities that are strategically much what we need to do and the gaps that we need to fill and they match our return criteria, we will continue to execute. And we feel good about our ability to plug them in into the business model, so.","David Katter - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Excellent.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review the financial highlights and corporate results. Then, Juan will review the drivers of our performance in the quarter, provide an update on our scorecard, and discuss our forward look. Finally, they will take your questions.","Please turn to slide three. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we'll report the second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million. After a challenging start of the year, general market conditions began to turn at the end of the second quarter, providing us with improved opportunities for the second half of the year.","Weak grain handling margins and merchandising results continued for Ag Services. Results for Corn including the strong performance in sweeteners and starches offset by lower ethanol results. Our Oilseeds operations leveraged their flex capacity to crush record volumes of soybeans in the second quarter as global protein demand continues to grow. WFSI saw a strong growth in flavors and systems with operating profit in line with the year-ago quarter.","During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan, acquiring full ownership of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. We added soybean crushing capability to our facility in Straubing, Germany, allowing us to utilize flex capacity, while also meeting growing customer demand for non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. We continued to invest in Asia's growing and evolving food demand by further increasing our strategic ownership stake in Wilmar from 20% to 22%.","In addition, we continued to make progress in the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills. We have implemented almost $150 million of new run-rate savings actions in the first half of the year and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. Also, we repurchased about $500 million of shares in the first half as we continued to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework. The first half of the year was very challenging. However, with improved fundamentals, we anticipate a more favorable second half of the year.","I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. Now, I will turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide four provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.41, down from the $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $151 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29% compared to 27% in the second quarter of the prior year, largely due to a $20 million of unique discrete tax items in the quarter that negatively impacted our effective tax rate as well as our second quarter EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. Note we did not impact our adjusted EPS for these $0.03 of discrete tax items.","Although our full-year tax rate will largely depend on a number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our calendar year tax rate to be about 28%. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 5.7% is 90 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 remains to earn an ROIC equal to or in excess of our cost of capital. On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.41 per share. For this quarter, we had gains on sales or asset revaluations of $0.17 per share, asset impairments of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.09 per share.","Slide five provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. In the Ag Services segment, there was a net gain of $43 million reflecting the collection of the final deferred proceeds from the sale of Gruma shares in 2012, offset by some small impairment charges. In the Corn Processing segment, there was a net gain of $63 million related to sale of our Brazilian sugar assets, partially offset by $6 million of small impairment charges. In Oilseeds Processing, we did not have any material items that impacted adjusted EPS. Over the course of the second quarter, we did have unprecedented volatility in the soybean crush margins.","Earlier in the second quarter, we had expected the run up in the board crush margins to have a significant negative mark-to-market impact on our second quarter results. In June, however, margins fell dramatically and the net impact from a mark-to-market perspective ended up being minimal for the second quarter. We did have some negative timing effects related to soft seed crush and biodiesel hedges and these negative impacts should reverse themselves in the second half of the calendar year.","As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings at Wilmar are reported by ADM on a one-quarter lag basis. To note, Wilmar issued a profit warning in the middle of July announcing that it expects to report net losses of approximately $230 million for its second quarter. As a result, we expect to pick up about $50 million of equity losses in our third quarter results compared to the prior consensus estimates of about $50 million of equity earnings for the third quarter or about a $100 million swing in ADM's expected third quarter results. The tax rate we applied to Wilmar equity earnings is 0%; hence, the EPS impact of this $100 million swing will be about a negative $0.17 per share for our third quarter.","In WFSI, there was a $12 million revaluation gain related to our acquisition of the remaining interests in the WILD Amazon as joint venture. In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year and the revaluation of our liability to purchase the remaining stake in Harvest Innovations. Unallocated corporate costs of $116 million were down from the year-ago quarter primarily due to strong cost management.","Turning to the cash flow statement on slide six, here's the cash flow statement for the six months ending June 30, 2016 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated over $1 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first half, slightly lower than the first half of last year. Total capital spending for the first half was $396 million, down from the prior year's $540 million. Capital spending has been lowered during this more challenging first half of the year. Acquisitions of $120 million during the first half of 2016 included Harvest Innovations in WFSI, Medsofts and Ag Services in Morocco in Corn Processing. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 22% level.","During the first half of 2016, we spent about $487 million to repurchase approximately 13.5 million shares of ADM. Our objective remains to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the first half of the year was 594 million diluted shares. Our total return of capital to shareholders including dividends was about $800 million for the first half of the year. We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital return to shareholders.","Slide seven shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of June 30. Our operating working capital of $8.2 billion was down $0.1 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.4 billion, resulting in a net debt balance of $6.7 billion, up from the 2015 net debt level of $5.7 billion. Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.7 billion was down from the $18.6 billion level last year due primarily to capital returns in excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $4.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add available cash, we had access to $5.6 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very, very solid.","Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ray. Please turn to slide eight.","In the second quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $724 million from last year's second quarter. In Ag Services, weak grain handling margins and merchandising results continued. Results for Corn were down slightly compared to the second quarter last year with continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches offset by weaker bioproducts results. With continued strong global protein demand, our Oilseeds operations were able to utilize flex capacity to crush record volumes of soybeans in the quarter.","Excluding the startup items, WFSI operating profit results were in line with the year-ago quarter. As a result, adjusted segment operating profit was flat versus last quarter and down 21% versus the year-ago quarter. Late in the quarter, market conditions began to turn lining up a more favorable outlook for the second half. Now, I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional details.","Starting on slide nine, we indicated last quarter that Ag Services in the second quarter would be challenged, and as it turned out, adjusted results were down significantly compared to one year ago due to compressed U.S. grain handling margins. In the U.S., we saw limited merchandising, warehousing and storage opportunities due to reduced grain carries.","International merchandising results remained weak overall, but were up versus one year ago due to the strong origination results in Argentina and the addition of destination marketing in Egypt through our Medsofts joint venture. Net timing effect did not have a material impact on results. In transportation, results declined due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates. In milling and other, ADM Milling had a strong second quarter driven by product margins and merchandising results.","Please turn to slide 10. Corn Processing results were up sequentially but down slightly versus the second quarter last year. Sweeteners and starches results were higher as the business continued to perform well with higher volumes and pricing, and improved margins from optimizing product grind in our corn wet mills. In addition, the integration of the recent Eaststarch and Morocco acquisitions, have gone better than planned, contributing to our global sweeteners and starches portfolio and results.","Bioproducts results were down in the quarter; with high industry ethanol inventory levels coming into the quarter, we decreased production. While ethanol margins have improved modestly and demand for both domestic consumption and exports continue to be strong, margins remain very volatile and extremely sensitive to industry production grades and inventory levels. Lysine results continued to be pressured by large global production, particularly early in the quarter. However, results improved in June as global inventories declined and a strong demand continued.","Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were solid for the second quarter, but were down versus a strong quarter one year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels primarily due to weak canola margins as well as lower soy crush margins, which were historically high last year. Strong global demand for protein meal and the continued weak economics for soft seed allowed us to flex the capacity of our end market crush plants in Europe. These added positive contributions to our network and allowed our North American and European crush operations to set new second quarter soy crush volume records.","During the quarter, the team effectively managed unprecedented board crush movements that were caused by South American crop uncertainty. By the end of the quarter, supply-demand fundamentals stabilized crush margins. Earlier in the quarter, we had expected significant soybean crush negative mark-to-market impacts for the second quarter due to significant increase in board margins, but the actual net impact turned out to be quite minimal as board crush margins fell in June. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were down from one year ago mainly due to negative biodiesel timing effects despite strong results in Specialty Fats and Oils and Golden Peanut. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter improved partially due to Wilmar's first quarter earnings. As Ray indicated earlier, Wilmar had issued a second quarter profit warning in July that we expect will have a negative impact for the ADM's third quarter results.","On slide 12, excluding the start-up costs, WFSI results were in line with the second quarter last year with the strong growth in flavors and systems offset by a slower separate individual ingredient sales. In the quarter, we added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with the full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. This gives us the full capability of flavors and systems in Brazil with boots on the ground to develop systems and provide customers with rapid prototype delivery to meet local business.","Results included about $4 million in operational start-up costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande. We expect WILD Flavors to have an extremely strong second half of the year, which should result in year-over-year operating profit growth of more than 20%. However, continuing challenges with some of our legacy ingredients businesses, demand factors in the case of hydrocolloids, near-term pricing pressures in the case of fibers and some inventory management issues at SCI will limit overall WFSI segment operating profit growth this calendar year to lower double-digit percentages.","Now in slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few. In Ag Services, in the second quarter, we started operations in our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt as we continued to expand our distribution value chain through our destination marketing capabilities on an asset-light approach. The Medsofts joint venture helps us diversify and expand our merchandising footprint, grow our logistics services and gets us closer to our customers as we deliver products directly to them.","In Corn, we completed the sale of our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. We began operation of our Casablanca, Morocco-based corn wet mill as we continued to expand the geographic footprint of our sweeteners and starches business. We expanded our sweetener portfolio by entering into a partnership to offer low calorie non-GMO stevia and monk fruit ingredients. Within our animal nutrition business, we introduced new products and announced plans to expand and modernize facilities.","In our lysine business, we made process improvements that should improve yields in the second half of the year and we are advancing on the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills assets. We have made management presentations to seven parties that have indicated interest in our dry mill assets. We will await all the proposals to determine what is the best value-maximizing strategy for ADM. We anticipate receiving bids back by the end of August and we'll then evaluate and determine our next steps in the process.","In Oilseeds, we completed the canola crush expansion project at our plant in Lloydminster, Canada and we added soybean crushing capacity at our facility in Straubing, Germany, allowing us to meet growing customer demand from non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. And in WFSI, we build out additional synergy projects, and now have more than 1,300 projects in the pipeline. Our latest forecast for the end of 2017 is shifting to about two-third cost synergies and one-third revenue synergies, due to revenue synergies taking a little longer to realize.","We added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and we had another productive IFT just a few weeks ago, highlighting recent additions in SCI, Eatem Foods and Harvest Innovations. Together, we showcased the industry's broadest and deepest ingredient portfolio, giving customers access to innovative products, extensive technical expertise, and best-in-class service. These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of this.","Before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated earlier, both the second quarter and the first half of the year were challenging. Throughout this period, we continued our ongoing focus on costs. And importantly, we continued to execute on our strategy, which includes additional geographic diversification by moving further downstream in the value chain. Now looking ahead, with recent improved market dynamics, we anticipate better opportunities.","The outlook for the large U.S. crop and some of our businesses experiencing improved margin conditions creates a platform for a more favorable environment in the second half of the year and some optimism as we start to move into early 2017. For Ag Services, current U.S. crop conditions indicate the growing season is progressing very well. This is expected to translate into improved export volumes and margins, higher utilization of our transportation network and better merchandising and handling opportunities for the second half of the year.","For Corn, the strategy and flexibility of our wet mills, along with continued operational excellence, achievements and high-capacity utilization rates, should support improved margins for our sweeteners and starches business for the second half of the year. Into the future, our global sweeteners and starch demand continues to grow. Our product and footprint expansions will provide diversification of both geography and starch sources to help maximize cost positions and drive value creation.","Ethanol margins have improved since the beginning of the year, and the forward demand environment from domestic consumption and exports would appear favorable. However, the future margin environment will remain dependent upon industry production levels relative to demand and the resultant inventory levels. We have seen this inventory to margins relationship over the years, and we have seen the margins being somewhat volatile as well.","In Oilseeds, the outlook for the second half of the year has improved due to continued strong global protein demand, leverage in our flex capacity and improved crush margins. Looking ahead, on trend, complex consumer demands are creating value for our oils portfolio and oilseeds network.","For WFSI, increased innovation in natural health and nutritional products and leverage in our industry leadership in plant-based proteins, powders and specialty grains, all are positive supports for the future progress of WFSI. With organic growth, synergy execution, and small bolt-on M&A, we continue to build this business for the future.","With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess, first, I would like to talk about the second half opportunity; and, Juan, you laid out some thoughts on drivers of better performance particularly in Ag Services. And I'm just trying to think about some of the range of outcomes or some of the key \u2013 the bigger variables in that Ag Services outlook as we think about, I guess, the fourth quarter specifically. Is it the export cadence of corn and soy trying to find \u2013 go through the ports at the same time? Is it farmers selling? Is it the magnitude of carries in the corn and the wheat market? Other factors that help band some of the kind of the bigger opportunities or the risks there.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Yeah. Thank you, Adam. So, as I said before, the outlook for U.S. exports is much better, and current elevation margins are much higher than the last two quarters. Export elevation margins are likely to continue higher in the back of the year. So, as you said, demand continues to be strong, and the U.S. is competitive now for the future months.","We also are seeing with carries and basis gains that have returned to the market, we expect in the same area that destination marketing continue to increase for us, the impact of that. And we expect an even more impact in 2017.","Milling volumes normally gets into our high season in Q3, so we expect another pickup from there. And general transportation results are expected to improve on increased loads and higher freight rates. We expect southbound volume probably increase in the range of 30% in Q3. So, all-in-all, we're optimistic by the picture we're seeing in Ag Services after many months of subdued performance, if you will.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Tom Simonitsch on for Ann. Could you discuss your expectations for U.S. ethanol exports for the remainder of 2016? In particular, given that China has been a major importer year-to-date, if China were to stop importing ethanol, are there other markets you would expect to absorb U.S. production?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Tom. Our expectation for net exports is in the range of 850 million to 900 million gallons. And obviously, China is the second largest market of ethanol in the world. And we have seen there \u2013 both in China and in India, the export \u2013 the imports picking up and that have been a boost obviously for U.S. exports.","Your concerns are probably given by the change in corn policy in China and to what extent that will reduce the imports. We believe in that range, in the 850 million to 900 million gallons. We continue to see other markets coming on again strongly like India; we believe China may or may not reduce there. We believe Canada will be there. We believe Mexico will join. So, in general, we feel strongly about it and we could argue China may dedicate some of that corn to make ethanol, but also there are questions about the quality of those reserves and how much of that can actually be turned into ethanol.","So, again, when we look at the forecast and without having a significant amount of China exports in the second half, we believe into the \u2013 in the 850 million to 900 million gallon range for net exports for the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Morris with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just \u2013 I guess just following on Adam's question, and I just had a follow-up, just on the optimism at the second half, I mean, there's been a lot of moving pieces, lot of volatility in the first half and your views kind of changed as you moved through the year. So, just getting a sense, as your level of optimism now about the back half of the year today relative to, let's say, a month ago, what's changed? And within that, should \u2013 you talked about a favorable third quarter, should profits be up year-over-year? If you can kind of just sort of frame your outlook where it is today versus a month ago. And some of your \u2013 just your broader expectations.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's Ray here. I mean, the way we kind of look at this year, second half compared to let's say, the second half of last year, I mean, there are several variables that have moved in our favor. And first of all, the U.S. dollar actually has stabilized compared to where we were last year. In fact, you've seen that relative to other crop growing regions, the dollar has actually become a lot more competitive. And that's a favorable factor for Ag Services as we look towards exports in the back half of the year. And frankly, that's been reflected in terms of elevation margins, forward elevations margins that we're seeing right now compared to what we saw last year.","And secondly, if you recall last year, there was this overhang regarding Argentina, you remember? And we went into second half of the year, there was a lot of concern that with the change in the government, that there was going to be a flood of Argentinean products entering world markets and that actually depressed margins significantly. What we've seen this year is in fact due to some weather issues down in Argentina and Brazil, this overhang doesn't exist. In fact, a lot of the surplus corn and wheat that was in Argentina actually moved to the world markets already, and hence, you don't have the Argentine overhang. And that's going to be favorable in terms of how U.S. exports are going to look like.","I mean, thirdly, global demand remains very, very strong, in terms of what we're seeing, in terms of the demand factors. And then as I indicated, there has been \u2013 due to weather factors, shortages that have occurred, out of South America that's actually helped in terms of global supply demand balance that we're seeing right now. And that's a favorable with respect to U.S. exports in the back half of the year. Then lastly, you take a look at the U.S. crop, I mean, the USDA numbers are very, very healthy. But I mean, expectations are that potentially crop could actually be bigger than what the USDA is predicting. So, the supply environment and the opportunity book for basis opportunities in the U.S. actually becomes a lot real as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year. So, in general, that's the reason why we're seeing a lot more optimism particularly for the Ag Services division as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I wanted to ask a little bit more about Wilmar and just kind of what's going on right there. Juan, I think, you're on the board, or one of you guys are on the board over there, and I'm just curious as to kind of the risk management failure over there, and has it been corrected? I believe this relates to soybeans. And business, as you guys know, extremely well. So, I'm just curious on what's going on. The question specifically then relates to is this like a third-quarter effect only, would their losses kind of persist into other quarters? And then are some \u2013 are there \u2013 were there opportunities in the second quarter in terms of crushing margins that ADM might have been able to lock in that could be a big offset to these problems that Wilmar is going to generate in the P&L in the third quarter? Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, David. So, yes. I am in the board of Wilmar. Listen, the significant loss was triggered by extremely volatile movements in soybean future prices and board crush margins in Q2 caused by you know rapidly evolving crop conditions in Argentina. The Wilmar risk management to the extent that I can comment on that, I mean, they're going to be releasing earnings next week. So, I need to be prudent here. But the Wilmar risk management process include having the risk limits and loss limits and having stop losses on positions like every risk company and with the abrupt movements in prices, these stop losses were triggered in Q2.","Without going into the details of their performance, we do believe this being a one-off situation, and if you think about Wilmar, they participate in a very \u2013 I mean they are a very large crusher, and they participate in a very volatile part of the world, this is their first quarterly loss since their IPO in 2006. So, this \u2013 it's not that this is a common occurrence and as unfortunate as it is, we do believe that hopefully it's a one-off. But again, I will relate you to their earnings call that is going to happen in \u2013 I think in August 12.","Regarding the \u2013 our ability to offset some of these with Q3 performance in Oilseeds, obviously, this is $100 million delta in Q3, which is difficult. We are optimistic about our Oilseeds performance in the second half and we believe that for \u2013 the U.S. will be a center stage for exports during the second half of the year. So, at this point in time, we believe that Oilseeds will be able to have very good performance in Q3 even despite the $100 million that you will have to adjust for the Wilmar impact.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","My question focuses on Ag Services. There's been a lot of volatility in the grain markets. So, could you kind of help us benchmark what's that earnings range and earnings on a normal year we should think about Ag Services? And going forward, what are the key drivers of just fundamental growth in that business?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Farha. I think, you described it correctly. Given the last couple of years that we have with a lot of volatility, I will probably refrain from issuing a statement on the range until we see us going through this more normalized conditions, if you will. We certainly are very optimistic for the second half of the year in Ag Services with several components. As I talked a little bit about exports, and we feel very confident about that. We have a big book on already with strong elevation margins.","We see strong demand continues and the combination of strong demand with certainly large crops in the U.S. will bode well for Ag Services in order to be able to handle a lot of grain. Wheat carries are there. And I think with a little bit of softening of the \u2013 on the dollar plus the big crops, the U.S. is competitive in soybeans, is competitive in \u2013 certainly is competitive in corn, is competitive in soybeans. And it's getting competitive in wheat. So, I think that bodes very well for our Ag Services business. So...","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Can I take a picture of kind of like 2017 and beyond? And if I think about the increased protein consumption out there, I think about increased chicken production, hog production, cattle production, increased soybean meal demand, can you make a case that your soy \u2013 your crush margin outlook should actually be structurally higher going to 2017? And how are you positioned to take advantage of that? Or are you not positioned to take the advantage of that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think we are, Ken. I \u2013 we tend to agree with you. We think that with the growth rates that there are out there and it can continue to tighten capacity until the point in which it makes sense to start expanding capacity. So, we believe in growing margins going forward and we believe that we are in excellent position to do that. You heard me saying several times about our flex capacity and how we have added to our plans, the ability to crush more soybeans and we have done that in several parts of the world, not only in North America, but also in Europe.","And there has been the bottlenecks; we reported this quarter, record soybean crush in both Europe and North America, and that's the fruits basically of our operational excellence effort in which every plant has been able to turn a little bit more of a bigger output as the market demand. So, we think we are very well-positioned and we think that the market requires that. So, we tend to agree with you. We think that 2017 and forward could be good years for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. I was hoping you'd kind of give us a sense on that subject about where forward crush margins are today in the second half. You said they had come down from very high levels. Would you consider those forward margins better than average, average? How would you describe them?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think at this point in time in the U.S., the plants are running at the mid-80%s capacity. And we believe that the margins are solid margins, strong margins for North America. So, without giving you any specific numbers, it comes down from an exceptional position, if you will, but we still believe that they are strong.","The global customer have not come to the market that aggressively yet, so at this point in time, I will say our export book trails a little bit the one of last year, but we believe that that's going to be corrected so...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two questions, both pretty brief. Third quarter, Ag Services. We've all seen the USDA export numbers that they have for this crop year which we only have, what, 4 weeks left or 4.5 weeks. And it seems like, I don't know if we get that all shipped in this quarter, but it seems like on a sequential quarterly basis, we should see an improvement in your Ag Services business. Whether you get to a year-over-year positive in Q3 is questionable, but would you expect to start seeing some improvement in Q3 with majority mostly in Q4 for the year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Eric, we expect Q3 to be significantly better than the quarters that we've been posting in Ag Services and certainly with the potential for Q4 obviously to be even bigger. But we will see the improvement already in Q3, and I will say it should be a strong improvement.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Good. And then,Juan, one of the things that's actually been a bit of a surprise to me, really, I think, it started in the fourth quarter last year, can you give us a little flavor for the soft seed business? I think in Q4 last year, it was about a negative $50 million operating profit swing in soft seeds, which was a big number, and it continues to be pretty soft. Can you talk about the quinoa side of it for a minute? And does that have a chance of coming back and that would be a, I would think, as good an improvement in your oil seed crush or in your oil seed profits for the second half as probably anything else?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It's been weak so far, as you referred to, Eric. And \u2013 but you know, at this point in time, Canada is looking at a very good crop and with China having drawn down some of the oil stocks, we think that a good story may be brewing now there for Canadian crush business. So, we have become recently more positive about that business, and the perspective of that business for the second half.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about your progress? When you talk about the ethanol options that you have, can you give us a wide range of what you're looking at and what the timing is of that?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ken, it's Ray here. Yes, as we indicated, we've already done management presentations to some potential interested parties. We've been very open-minded in terms of what alternatives we would consider, whether it be a sale, whether it be joint ventures, whether it be some other structures there. We're going to evaluate all these options. We expect first indications back to us in the month of August, and we'll look at what makes sense from a value maximization perspective for our company here.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is there an option that you'd actually want to keep more of the business than you previously expected given the progression of the ethanol margins?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If we get fair value for the assets, I think that's highly unlikely.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Stuart Henry - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. This is Mike Henry in for Mike Piken. Thank you for the question. Going back to ethanol, just curious if you guys could give some color on the current run rate or capacity that you were utilizing during the second quarter, what that should look like going forward, and any commentary on what level you would potentially bring capacity back online or run production a little bit harder. And then just second question, if you could give some more color around the biodiesel impact in the second half on timing and the potential for that to provide some incremental upside in Oilseeds? Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Mike. So the issue with when you think about the ethanol industry when we came into the Q2 in April, ethanol inventories were basically very high, running about 8% above last year. So, obviously, going into the driving season, we took some shutdowns. And at the end of July, inventories are about 3.4% above last year. So a more normal, if you will, inventory situation. So, at this point in time, we will continue to titrate that, whether we run for yield as I describe sometimes or we run for volume. I think that given the volatility of the ethanol results, we'd probably always keep an eye on running for yield. But we probably don't see the need right now to slow down like we did in Q2 where we took a hit for the volume that we didn't move, so.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the question regarding just the timing effects, I've indicated in prior calls that in the Oilseeds division, we normally have some level of timing effects. In this quarter, it was really related to soft seeds and biodiesel. In the past, I've indicated this normal range. It could be anywhere up to $40 million to $50 million, plus or minus. And so in this particular quarter, it was more of a negative timing effect that we expect to reverse out in the second half of this year.","So we didn't call out a number. It's within our normal ranges. So it's within the normal $40 million to $50 million type of number that we would normally have.","Michael Stuart Henry - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Juan and Ray, can you comment a little bit more about the legacy businesses in the WFSI division and what's causing the underperformance? And I think you said that there were slower-than-expected revenue synergies. Was it in that division? And if so, can you explain why?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So some of the legacy businesses, one of the businesses is, for example, hydrocolloids. Hydrocolloids go like about half of it to food applications and that continues to go really well, but about half of it goes to drilling fluids. And as you can read, the industry has basically reduced significantly the drilling in the U.S., so that market has been significantly impacted. So nothing to do with our food strategy, if you will, but it happens that we report it in that segment.","The second is related to fibers, the fibers market. It has a little bit of overcapacity, so prices have been soft there, and we have some more competition. And one of the businesses that we are acquired, SCI, have had some issues with the inventory that we needed to write off or sell it at a discount because they may not have been in the greatest of conditions. So all those three things basically impacted the WFSI business.","On the other hand, WILD Flavors is growing significantly and it's going to post growth of about 20% year-over-year basically on innovation that is happening at the customer level. So when we talked about the revenue synergies being a little bit slow, it's because obviously, first of all, you need to think about how to combine all these products into a new solution. And then you create the prototypes and then you present those to the customer and customers create a marketing campaign and also look at the potential for that product and look at the stability of those products.","So that approval process takes a little bit longer, especially in some of the companies that are very much focusing nowadays on cost and productivity. And they may not have that many people to take care of this product. So that's why we tried to ramp up a little bit more the cost synergies to make sure we don't fall behind in our promises. But, as I've said, the WILD Flavors business is going strong and having again probably a 20% increase in profits versus already a record year like it was 2015. So we are extremely proud of the business.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. It relates to sweeteners and starches. Do you think that the profits you're seeing in that business are sustainable going into next year? And could you discuss your shifting of the grind to higher value-added products? Is there any measures we can put against that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Farha. I wouldn't like to describe a number or talking about the number for 2017, but certainly, the dynamics at this point in time in the industry calls for a little bit of a continuation of the supply-demand fundamentals we see now. Certainly, exports to Mexico have been better than expected certainly. There has been a flattening of the secular decline of the U.S. domestic market, if you will. And what we continue to do, which we like and it bodes well for the future of the business is we continue to introduce new products. And some of these products are more at the developmental stage, if you will, but some you can see in the press releases that we continue to launch these products.","At this point in time, I cannot give you top of my head something that you could look at to track the progression of that portfolio. But traditionally, five years ago, we look at trying to replace 10% of the grind, if you will, just in case hydrocolloids (53:25) were going to decline 2% per year, which is nothing happened. So we haven't needed to bring all those products, but we have all those developments. And as we're trying to sell up our capacity and bring products that got higher margins, we continue to introduce some of that. So, probably, we will get together with our businesses and we will try to come up with some kind of indication that at least you can track on the progress of that initiatives. We haven't done it, as I said, because of the strength of sweeteners and starches. We didn't feel that we needed to communicate anything of that.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","One thing to note, Farha, is we have purchased the remaining interest in Eaststarch. That is something different and that is an increment compared to where we were before. So that clearly is a positive. And as we indicated in prior calls, the Eaststarch acquisition was about $0.04 per share accretive to our overall earnings going forward.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful.

However first-quarter results were impacted by weak global crush margins, WFSI results were in line with expectations. So, while our adjusted ROIC was below WACC on a four-quarter trailing average basis, we expect to be above WACC for the full year. We continue to take actions to mitigate the impact of near-term market conditions.","During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan. We acquired a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, enhancing ADM's plant protein, gluten-free ingredients portfolio. We announced the purchase of a corn wet mill in Morocco that will further expand our global sweeteners footprint. We opened our new state-of-the-art flavor creation, application and customer innovation center in Cranbury, New Jersey. And as part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we reached an agreement to sell our Brazilian sugarcane ethanol operations.","In addition, we achieved almost $50 million of run-rate savings in the quarter and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. We repurchased about $300 million of shares in the quarter and paid dividends of about $200 million as we continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework.","The first-half of the year continues to present a challenging environment. However, we are cautiously optimistic that reduced South American soybean and corn production could bring improved soybean crush margins and merchandising opportunities in the second-half of the year. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Juan. Slide four provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.42, down from the $0.78 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $319 million.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 25%, compared to 29% in the first quarter of the prior year, largely due to differing geographic mix of earnings. Although, it is still early in the year and our full-year tax rate will largely depend upon the number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our tax rate to be at the lower end or below the 28% to 30% range that I mentioned in the fourth quarter earnings call.","Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.3%, is 30 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 is to earn an ROIC in excess of our cost of capital despite the challenging operating environment that's likely to persist for the majority of the year.","On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.42 per share. For this quarter, we had asset impairment and restructuring charges of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.02 per share.","Slide five provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results.","There was nothing extraordinary in terms of unique accounting or special items in the operating lines to note this quarter. In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year.","Unallocated corporate costs of $116 million were slightly higher than year-ago quarter due to asset impairment charges of approximately $11 million, primarily from some software impairment. Going forward, unallocated corporate costs should be in the area of $120 million per quarter as I have outlined in prior earnings calls.","And minority interest in other was significantly unfavorable to the prior year after absorbing $50 million of equity income losses or $0.08 per share after tax, booked in this quarter and which was included in both reported EPS and adjusted EPS, related to updated portfolio investment valuations in CIP, an investment joint venture that we've held since the late 1980s and in which ADM currently has a 43.7% equity interest.","Turning to the cash flow statement on slide six, here's the cash flow statement for three-month period ending March 31, 2016, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $557 million from operations before working capital changes in the quarter, slightly lower than the first quarter of last year. Total capital spending for the quarter was $180 million, down from the prior year's $244 million. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 20% level.","During the quarter, we spent about $0.3 billion to repurchase approximately 9 million shares. Our objective remains to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the quarter was 597 million diluted shares outstanding, down 42 million from the same period one year ago.","Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends was about $0.5 billion for the quarter. We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital returned to shareholders in quarter.","Slide seven shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31. Our operating working capital of $7.7 billion was down $0.5 billion from the year ago period. Total debt was approximately $6.6 billion, resulting in a net debt balance of $5.4 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.1 million, in part, reflecting the issuance in June 2015 of the \u20ac1.1 billion of euro debt and the subsequent repurchase of $0.9 billion of U.S. debt.","Our leverage position remains healthy, with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 22%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion was down from the $18.8 billion level last year due to shareholder capital returns in excess of net income by approximately $870 million and a cumulative translation account also down about $80 million due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of March. If you add available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains solid.","Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ray.","Please turn to slide eight. In the first quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $892 million from last year's first quarter. Ag Services results were challenged by lower U.S. export volumes, significantly lower margins and unfavorable merchandising positions from the Global Trade Desk. Results from corn improved in the quarter, compared to the first quarter last year, led by strong performance in sweeteners and starches.","For Oilseeds, results were impacted by lower global crush margins compared to an exceptional strong year-ago quarter. WFSI was in line with expectations, up from the prior year with solid performance from WILD Flavors and higher results from specialty proteins. As a result, segment operating (11:25) was down 36% versus the year-ago quarter.","Now, we'll review the performance of each segment and provide additional details. Starting on slide nine, in the first quarter, Ag Services' results were down significantly compared to last year's first quarter. In merchandising and handling, we continued to see a challenging merchandising environment for our Ag Services North American footprint. We saw weak U.S. export competitiveness, lower North American volumes and significantly reduced margins.","In addition, we had a quarterly loss for the Global Trade Desk compared to positive results last year. Losses from the Global Trade Desk were caused in part by unfavorable merchandising positions. These were unrealized losses generated in part by the significant movements in prices at the end of March.","In transportation, results declined due to low U.S. exports and high water conditions on the Mississippi River system that drove lower barge volumes and higher operating costs. Milling and other had a solid quarter, but results were down due to lower grain and feed margins.","Please turn to slide 10. Corn processing results were up slightly, led by results in sweeteners and starches, which performed well with an improved cost environment and strong capacity utilization. In addition, Eaststarch results were up, in part due to the consolidation of the results of the acquired operations in November 2015. Our Olenex joint venture also had stronger results in the quarter with solid sweetener demand in Mexico. Bioproducts results were down in the quarter due to tough lysine and ethanol margins.","Ethanol margins continued to be driven by high industry production levels that caused inventories to build throughout the quarter. In April, we saw inventories come down in the month as domestic and export demand remains solid and production levels slowed. This is due in part to seasonal maintenance programs of many plants in our industry.","In addition, the continued overcapacity of the global lysine market negatively impacted results. While we expect this to continue through the second quarter, we are taking actions to further improve our lysine operations and are looking to stabilize the business in the second half of the year.","Slide 11 please. Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus an exceptionally strong quarter one year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels. While global protein demand remains solid, global soybean crush and origination results were down significantly due to lower global margins resulting from increased Argentine soymeal exports. U.S. crush volumes were down primarily due to reduced U.S. mill exports.","In addition, lower soft seed crush volumes and weaker Brazilian commercialization that slowed throughout the quarter negatively affected results.","Refined oils, packaged oils and biodiesel was down with stronger results from North America and Europe, partially offset by weaker results in South America. North American biodiesel demand was strong with the extension of the biodiesel credit to the end of the year. With the sale of cocoa business in October 2015, results decreased $24 million compared to last year. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined due primarily to Wilmar's lower fourth quarter earnings.","In April, we started to see improvements in soy board crush margins. While these movements create near-term negative mark-to-market implications for our positions in the second quarter, this improved crush margins, if sustained, should translate to better results in the second half of the year compared to the first half.","Slide 12, please. WFSI results were up from last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter. We saw solid performance from WILD Flavors and higher results from specialty ingredients, including specialty proteins, polyols and natural health and nutrition products. Results included more than $3 million in operational startup costs for the Tianjin Fibersol facility in China and the Campo Grande specialty protein complex in Brazil. With more than 900 revenue-synergy projects identified, WFSI remains on track to achieve its 2016 targets.","Only two months in, we're excited about what we see for Harvest Innovations. It's a great example of how you can plug the right bolt-on and drive results. We can leverage our internal origination strength, originate all the soybeans and contract the acres, yet benefit from the specialty ingredients component of WFSI. Harvest is a nice business, a quality facility and provides a great complement to our existing commodity network, yet allows us to feed our specialty business while building out our portfolio.","We would remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% operating profit growth target for 2016. In the second quarter, we expect some modest underlying growth on a year-over-year basis and we'll continue to see some additional startup costs. Our growth will be more concentrated in the second half based upon the pattern of new business and synergy realizations, the startup of Campo Grande, as well as the avoidance of some unique one-time costs incurred last year.","Now on slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. We highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few. In Ag Services, we continue to grow our destination marketing capabilities as we recently closed in April our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt.","In corn, we announced plans to acquire a Casablanca, Morocco-based corn wet mill that produces glucose and native starch. The facility is the leading sweeteners and starch supplier in the country that should see substantial demand growth in the coming years. In the quarter, we also announced the agreement to sell our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. And we are making good progress with the strategic review of our ethanol dry mill operations, which we announced in February.","In Oilseeds, we began significant expansion and modernization of the Santos port in Brazil, expanding annual storage and grain handling capacity from 6 million to 8 million metric tons.","And in WFSI, we acquired Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO, organic, and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We also expect our Campo Grande soy protein complex in Brazil to begin ramping up production during the second half of the year. We have targeted plans to expand our business with existing customers and gain new customer business in this important region.","In March, we opened our new WFSI state-of-the-art flavor creation, application and customer innovation center in Cranbury, New Jersey. Also, just two weeks ago, ADM celebrated a grand opening of the new headquarters of National Foodworks Services, a food innovation center in Decatur, Illinois. And we announced the launch of the Food Innovation Challenge, designed to inspire more entrepreneurs to develop and commercialize their food innovation in the Midwest. Together, these initiatives leveraged the broad strengths of ADM and the food ingredient strengths of our WFSI business unit.","So, these are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our scorecard progress each quarter and over time, you should expect to see the results of all this.","So, before we take your questions, I wanted to offer also some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated earlier, the first half of the year continues to present a challenging environment. And our performance in the first quarter reinforces that we have more work to do, to focus on actions that we can control and which will make the company better in the long run. These actions include our ongoing focus on costs, lightening up the amount of capital in our business, additional geographic diversification and our continued efforts to move further downstream in the value-chain.","Separately, there are some new global developments that make us cautiously optimistic as we look at the second half of the year. First, the heavy rain in Argentina is reducing the size of the Argentine soybean crop, creating a tighter soybean balance sheet that supports higher global crush margins.","Second, dry weather in Brazil is also reducing the size of the soybean crop and the safrinha corn crop. Third, the U.S. dollar has established against the currencies of other crop-growing regions. And finally, the tighter soybean balance sheet is further supported by strong global protein demand.","For Ag Services, the second quarter is a seasonal low volume quarter. However, we are seeing a large North American corn crop get planted in ideal conditions, which supports larger production. With the reduced South American crop, this could bring added export volumes and merchandising opportunities in the later part of the third quarter and fourth quarter.","For corn, sweeteners and starches continues to benefit from the flexibility at our wet mills, steady demand and low costs. The integration of the Eaststarch acquisition is going better than expected and will continue to help expand our global product portfolio and customer reach.","The ethanol industry margins remain challenged, although domestic and export demand remains strong and inventories have started to come down recently. The second half of 2016 currently has the potential for a better pricing environment, with tighter supply\/demand, but the key driver will be future production versus demand.","For Oilseeds in the second quarter, South America will continue to have more favorable supply economics. South America conditions are reducing global supplies, creating a tighter global stocks-to-usage scenario. This, along with solid growth in protein demand, is creating a better margin environment for soybeans. These market events have the potential for a modest improvement in late 2016.","For WFSI, on trend items like clean label, GMO-free, organic and natural, all fit well within the ADM's strategy and leverage the WFSI portfolio. With a diverse product portfolio, turnkey system solutions, and more than 900 revenue-synergy projects identified, we continue to build this business for the future. And WFSI remains on track to achieve second-half weighted 2016 profit targets","So, thank you for joining us today. Slide 15 notes some of the upcoming investor events where we'll be participating.","Now, we would like to open for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Evan Morris with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Evan Morris - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Evan.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Morris - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey. Juan, thank you for that outlook here. I guess, just still struggling a little bit. There has been a lot of things that have changed over the past few weeks. And I guess, just starting with your cautiously optimistic about the second-half, I guess is that a little bit more optimistic than you were, a little less optimistic, same? I guess, there's again a lot of moving pieces, what's more positive, what's more negative? I guess at the end of the day, when you kind of add this all up, does it put you in a \u2013 results going to be worse than expected for 2Q, but maybe better for the back half? if you can kind of just help to frame some of that, again given all the things that have changed over the past couple of weeks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If you'll recall, Evan, at our last earnings call we provided a scenario for the year and if I compare that scenario versus what we see today, I will say that in Ag Services, given the tough start of the year and probably a similar Q2 to the Q1, we are less optimistic about Ag Services' overall results for 2016.","In corn, what we said that we will see improvement in 2016 over 2015, we are even more confident about that given the strength of our sweeteners and starches and how the year is evolving.","If you look at the Oilseeds, we said that Oilseeds, we were expecting a down year versus the strong 2015, and we still expect that, but as you described, we are more optimistic about the second half of the year given some of the tightness in South America.","In WFSI, we continue to be excited about the future of that business and we continue to be in line with our previous forecast of growing 15% to 20% year-over-year. So, I will say, in general, we see the year similar to the last time, maybe a little bit better given these puts and takes.","Evan Morris - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. No, that's really helpful. And then just a couple, I guess more housekeeping kind of questions. On that Global Trade Desk loss, I mean how much was that, does that reverse in coming quarters? If you can just help us understand that, Ray.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, maybe I start and I'll let Ray do \u2013 our positions were not immune to the end of the quarter movements, significant volatility that we have. So we saw some of that. Some of that are open positions, some was mark-to-market, so part of that will come back. Maybe, Ray, you want to provide a little bit more color to that?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, I think that as we kind of closed up the quarter, I think we indicated that Ag Services should probably be in a lower end of the three-digit range. And I think that really what happened was with the movement in prices at the end of March, a lot of our positions kind of went negative. Most of it is unrealized in nature. We think some of these are timing effects. When you think about where we ended up, like $76 million versus let's say in the low $100 million, we were maybe $30 million off, some of it's timing related, maybe a third of it's probably timing related, some of it's unrealized positions, unrealized losses. We'll probably figure out where these contracts actually settle, where the prices will end up and there were some other unique items in that variance, which are really one timers that don't expect to repeat itself. So I think, Evan, it's a mixture of a combination of various factors that kind of caused this variance here.","Evan Morris - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks. I'll pass it along.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Evan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan Stanley (sic) [Securities] (29:04). Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, it's JPMorgan. I'll leave it there. Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Can you talk a little bit about what's happened in the last few weeks? Again, not to hover on that, but we'd seen a lot of farmers selling when prices rose. We're seeing exports pick up a little bit. Can you talk about why Q2 wouldn't shape up to be better than Q1 in Ag Services just given where we are today?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say couple of reasons. You're correct. We had a couple of days of very strong farmer selling as the board rallied. We're seeing that and we're seeing with the dollar stabilizing or weakening a little bit with regards to the other currencies, U.S. becoming a little bit more competitive. Well our cautious look to Q2, Ann, is mostly on Ag Services, because when we think about it, part of that is, second quarter is traditionally our lower export volume. South America becomes more competitive with the harvest and in general, our exports, even in good times, they tend to drop about 20% from Q1 to Q2, so they become \u2013 Q2 is the low margin. But also, even if exports will increase a little bit, there is still ample capacity and we don't foresee a big pickup in margins even if exports climb from this depressed level. So, we want to be mindful that, it may look a little bit better volume into Q2, it may not be reflected completely in significant pickup in margins for us. That's our view at the moment, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. And then just a little bit in terms of what your team is thinking for planted acres in the U.S., given the recent pricing movements. Is your team thinking perhaps more soybeans, more corn? Where do you stand if prices remain as is?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. At this point in time, we're thinking a little bit more soybeans maybe.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in line. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey Farha.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","First question's for Ray. Ray, you have highlighted an $0.08 per share charge related to a JV. Do you view that as one time an item, so we could exclude it or is that part of a regular kind of mark-to-market that we should include in results?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It means CIP is an investment that we've had since the late 1980s. Generally, it's actually a fairly stable equity earnings that they contribute to our results and that's the reason why we never really highlight it in any of our quarterly earnings call. It just happens. Like this time around, they actually had a significant revaluation of some of the private equity investments, which resulted in really a valuation reduction that when translated to ADM equity earnings, resulted in a $50 million negative impact. I view it as a unique item, because normally, it is not a factor in our earnings. And so, while we did not exclude it from adjusted EPS, so therefore our adjusted EPS number includes the $0.08 loss. I do view it as kind of a unique factor. So, when I think about run rate of earnings for this company, I would think about it in the context of excluding the $0.08 per share.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","And in terms of run rate earnings, could you just review any updates you have? Because I think that in the last call you were talking about $2.30 in earnings, plus another $0.30 benefit from your repurchase of shares and your cost savings program. So, normal run rate earnings we should expect from ADM is around the $2.60 level. Is that still the right way to think about it in context of the improvement in market conditions we've seen?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, the way I kind of think about it, if you recall, in the fourth quarter earnings call, we indicated that the base earnings of the company had been negatively impacted by the headwinds that we've seen. So I think we outlined that probably our base with the current headwind was probably in the neighborhood of $2.30, $2.40 a share. I think that given what we've seen in the Ag Services start for the first quarter of the year and likely a continuation in the second quarter, maybe some additional pressures on this base, although as Juan indicated, there could be some upside as it relates to where Ag Services and where Oilseeds may end up in the fourth quarter with the impact of the South American harvest. And so, I guess from my perspective, Farha, I think we're in the same ballpark at this point in time. I am encouraged that in terms of the improvements, the $1 to $1.50 of earnings improvements that we're driving over the medium term, I am encouraged that we believe we're still on track for those $1 to $1.50. So, namely, the work that we're doing in terms of getting the accretion from our recent investments, getting the accretion from WILD and the synergies related to WILD, getting the benefits of the operational excellence initiatives, and as you saw, reduced share count from our capital allocation framework, which includes buying back shares. So I'm encouraged that we're on track on the $1 to $1.50 of earnings improvements over the medium term.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And my final question, Juan, you had mentioned in your prepared commentary that you made good progress on your review of the ethanol assets. Any timeline that you are willing to place or any more color you can provide on that review?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The team continues, Farha, to analyze that. I mean, we made progress in terms also, carving out financials, getting an advisor and so, they are working on that. We, obviously, are going to manage the timing of that to maximize value for ADM in all these options. So, at this point, we have nothing else to announce other than we continue to make good progress. We're getting closer to make a decision on that.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Farha.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Wanted to ask a few questions. On ethanol, is the business expected to be profitable in the second quarter given what you're seeing on margins?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As I said before, I think, margins have \u2013 inventories have being reduced over the quarter and margins have improved a little bit. So, we will expect it to be profitable, yes, at this point, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then, Juan, could you frame-up your bigger picture assessment of the ethanol F&D right now? I mean, I think you made some comments about exports and so forth that were good, demand was good.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","How tight do you envision the F&D in totality in 2016?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We look at export markets continue to be strong. We've seen exports to China continues to be strong. Other than the traditional destination, there has been a significant growth versus last year of China and domestic demand is probably up in the range of may be 2% to 3% for the year. So, when you take domestic demand plus strong exports, we are thinking something in the range of 15 billion gallons and maybe we think that capacity piece is slightly above 15 billion gallons. So, I think a lot will be determined by the strengths of this driving season we are going to be heading into now with the summer and how some of the producers react.","I think that you have seen some of the shutdowns mostly due to planned maintenance in anticipation of the driving season, that has cleaned up part of the inventory backlog that we have built over this year, but we're still above 4% higher than inventories of last year. So, although we are getting better at that, there is still a significant amount of product that's there and that's why we've been a little bit more cautious. We continue to run for margins and trying to optimize our operations and we will continue to do so. But we saw the development of second quarter as a positive one versus how we started the year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. On the crush margins, in January we saw crush margins that were down in the low $0.30 per bushel, recent margins are like, I don't know, in the $0.70 per bushel, so it's like a big rally. However, on your comments, I take away that you really don't feel all that optimistic on crush margins in the second quarter and that it was only this movement on the board crush that gives you optimism on the third quarter and fourth quarter. If I've said that all correctly, maybe could you just say why don't the improvement in crush margins filter into 2Q?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, David, I just mentioned that normally when these crush margins expand like the way they did, we normally take a negative mark-to-market in that quarter. So, I was just saying from your modeling purposes, if you will, it is a positive development for us, for the rest of the year, so we feel good about it. Maybe I didn't express myself with the right amount of enthusiasm about it. It's obviously a positive for us. It's just in the short-term, I want to make sure you remember that we normally take a negative mark-to-market to that and we still don't know the magnitude of that. That is obviously evolving. But I will say, as I said in my initial remarks, we are more optimistic now than we were at the beginning of the year about the forecast for Oilseeds for the rest of the year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's super helpful. And just one last one, Ray. On the cost savings, you give this run rate number. Can you say what the realized savings were in the first quarter and what the realized savings will be in 2016, as opposed to run rates if they are different?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, just because of the timing issue, right, so roughly, half, we would say that it's been realized. But the reason why we give run rate, David, is just to \u2013 I mean that's how we kind of evaluate ourselves in terms of getting towards a \u2013 how much earnings power, operational excellence is contributing towards the company. And so, as you know, we set the objective at $275 million and so, we track it in order to determine \u2013 based upon all the initiatives that we've actually got to execute in the first quarter, what does that translate on an annualized basis. So that's the reason why we provide that number to you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, to give you some reference, when we said in the strategy that we count on $0.10 of accretion every year, so last year, when the run rate savings were about in the $220 million, $250 million, the actual savings for the year were about $90 million. So, if you think that this year we are planning $275 million depending on how these projects are implemented, but you think about half of that or something in the range $100 million to $120 million, that's where they should land for this year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific guys. Thank you so much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. I guess these questions will be around the edges. But I don't know, if you mentioned the reason for the financial results being so much higher than a year ago. Is there something happening in terms of your relationships with farmers that's giving you strong results there and how sustainable? And then also on lysine, do you expect those losses to persist for the rest of the year, and are they significant enough, I guess, to kind of offset or fully offset the modest margin positive you expect in ethanol?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I'll take the first one, Rob. So on other, financial was stronger than usual, a couple of reasons. I mean we actually had some strong results from our ADM investor services, I mean it's just like higher volatility in markets translates into higher volumes, and so that's been a benefit. The big one is, there was another investment that we've had over in Asia that actually had a distribution of earnings. And so, we were able to capture that in this quarter. Again, I would view that as kind of a positive. Would it be reoccurring in the future? Probably not, but it was a positive result for us in the first quarter.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Rob on the lysine front, there are market conditions that there is overcapacity in that industry, but then the results were also aggravated with some problems that we had in our own operations. We have addressed those through a project that we're implementing. That project will be on-stream by late Q3. So, we're going to see from our own self-help, better forecast for results for lysine in the second half. And then, we were encouraged by some of the price increases we have seen. So, we think that the impact of negative lysine economics in the second half will be less than in the first half. I can't quantify whether it's going to be positive at this point in time, it depends on the project we're implementing, but significantly better than what the first half will be.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. When I am looking at the USDA's estimates on grain exports, it seems like there is more good news lately after a very slow start to the year. Is what you're saying that you might participate in that good news, some increased volume, but maybe you bought the grain itself at higher levels and therefore, your cost basis is too high in order to make a good margin on that export volume, is that another way of saying it?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. What I was referring, Rob, was that the elevation margins, the export margins are a function of the capacity utilization of the export terminals, if you will, and there is still export capacity available in the U.S. So, what I was cautioning is that a small increase in export volumes may not create an exponential increase in the margins. So, I just wanted to cautious on that that it will not be a big multiplier effect. First of all, you need to fill the capacity, and since we are coming from very depressed levels, it will take a while. So, we are encouraged by the more competitiveness of U.S. exports and we expect that that will flow through our normal market share of that, we just don't expect a significant improvement in Q2. We expect Ag Services probably to have a better scenario after Q3, after we have the strong potential U.S. harvest.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the color. Could you walk us through a little bit more about the savings quarterly, about some of your cost savings programs, and which segments or sub-segments we might expect them to show up in in future quarters?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Michael, sure. Traditionally, given the corn business is the business with the biggest plants and the biggest units, that's where most of the work tend to happen. So, I will normally think that between 50% and 60% of all our savings should show in the corn segment. You have to understand though that part of these savings are related to energy savings and obviously, with low energy prices, some of that shifted a little bit versus maybe what they used to be a couple of years ago.","There is a lot going on also in terms of optimization of logistics. There is better software now that we can use to reduce shipments, to reduce storage, so. And then there is the issue, the contribution of purchasing. And I will say the contribution of purchasing in reduced raw material costs and consolidation of supply and SKUs, that normally shows in Oilseeds and in corn where they both buy chemicals.","So, I would say the operational, 50%, 60% in corn, the rest is probably a split between corn and Oilseeds, with the smallest part going to Ag Services, which is mostly a storage business, have less opportunities to improve cost of operations.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And from a timing perspective, I mean, is it going to be more back half weighted, most of these cost savings?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's because they are all related to projects that some of them imply some spending. So, yes, normally they ramp up over the year. So, it's more second half loaded. Also, in the first half, we normally take most of the non-discretionary investments. So, the maintenance we do in our plants in the first half. So, a lot of the activity of operations and engineering in the first half is mostly to maintain the plants. So, the projects to improve, they tend to happen later in the year as we give priority to the maintenance plants.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then lastly, if you could talk a little bit about the longer term outlook for WILD Flavors, and specifically, when you think you might be able to hit your return targets and what would be a good revenue run rate growth to you for 2016 and 2017, that would will be great?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Michael, we are very proud of our acquisition of WILD Flavors. Think about this, I think, a lot of people have doubt how a specialty company like WILD Flavors will be handled by a perceived commodity company like ADM. And we are very proud to say that, in the first year of operations, WILD Flavors actually had all-time record profit. So, I mean, we think that the integration went very, very well. We provided a great home and we have assimilated all that talent and that we are very happy working together. You have to realize that that unit, that end up being WFSI, went through a lot last year. It was their first year of operations and they not only had to integrate WILD with specialty ingredients, but also they need to integrate SCI, they need to integrate Eatem Foods, and now they are integrating Harvest Innovation.","So, we're creating something for the future, a long-term powerhouse in terms of ingredients and natural food and beverage, but in the mean time, we are delivering on the quarterly results on our goal. So, if you think about cost synergies, when we thought at the beginning they were going to be around $40 million, we're talking now about $70 million and revenue synergies are also going very well. So, we really feel very good. We still believe we're going to hit our three-year target for ROIC for the business and the business should grow revenue in the range of about 5% to 6% per year.","We're thinking growing profits in 15%, 20% for WFSI. So, we feel very good about that. But again, I just want to make sure people are reminded, we're building this for the future. There are a lot of things that we're bringing on stream. We're bringing a Fibersol plant on stream right now, we're bringing a huge vegetable protein complex in Brazil. More than $200 million of expense, many units of operations, so all that bring a lot of noise to the P&L because we have commissioning costs, we have all those things. So \u2013 but we're just very happy the way the team is delivering and the way the customers are reacting to that, so.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Ken.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just a couple questions. One is, in this kind of unusual environment, how come it doesn't net-net get you back to your normal level and what would it take in this environment for you to go back to that $350 million \u2013 $300 million, $350 million level to grow off? Because it seems like it kind of reestablishes the global picture, it gives you a little bit more dislocation opportunities. So, what do you see that doesn't get you to that $300 million, $350 million, or what do you need to have happen to get you to that $300 million, $350 million number?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, as you described, we had probably over the last, I don't know, month, a little bit of a better news that may potentially impact Oilseeds and potentially Ag Services in that sense. And probably maybe the thing that just happened recently, but I'm less sure the sustainability of it is maybe the ethanol margin improvement because it was really an event in which a lot of the industry plants took maintenance shutdowns in preparation for the driving season. Are we going to go back to the previous practices in producing more than we need? Difficult for us to predict.","So, I will say from a macro perspective, that's probably, Ken, the issue where I'm more cautious about. The other things, I think that we're going in the right direction and with these dislocations over time, Oilseeds and Ag Services should come back to the normal levels.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then, the one thing that you said about Ag Services which caught my attention was, the Ag Services going forward, was there a capacity addition or something like that in the industry that you're \u2013 that has created the overcapacity? Because it seems that over the last couple years, you guys have been saying there hasn't been as much growing. It seems like your language might have changed a little bit.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It was not from our side, but there is a little bit more capacity in the Gulf Coast, and that plus the fact that we've been exporting less, and I think, the issue sometimes, Ken, is how those exports come, whether they come at the same time and we can expand elevation margins, or whether they come over time and in capacity or margins don't climb that much. And we had a couple of years in which we had that event and we had very big expansions on margins, and we haven't seen that recently, and again, we don't expect to see it in Q2.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And my very last question is on the high fructose corn syrup, in your commentary, you referenced low-cost environment than capacity utilization rates. With corn prices going up, does that change the back half of the year at all, or do you still feel comfortable? Just because the wording just seemed like it was more lower cost environment rather than the higher high fructose corn syrup prices.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. Ken, I will say we feel very good about the high fructose corn syrup and the whole sweeteners and starches portfolio for the rest of the year, and probably I will say even for the 2017 as well, so no issues there.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Perfect. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Group. Your line is open.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Eric.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Eric.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","A couple of questions. I'd just like to drill down a little bit on your Ag Services, your global desk trading losses in the quarter, they were unrealized. Are those mark-to-market losses that will reverse in the second half?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think, Eric, some of it are mark-to-market and will reverse. Some of it will be a function of where prices are when those contracts settle.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So, it's a combination of the two of those.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then getting back to your second quarter, the outlook for your Oilseeds business, and I know that Juan cautioned on the size of the mark-to-market loss, but as far as I'm concerned, the bigger the loss, the better. That's just an accounting function non-cash charge that read, the larger your mark-to-market loss in Q2 or your accounting change in Q2 would just mean that reverses off in the second half at a larger profit rate. Is that an accurate statement?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it just means \u2013 as you know, Eric, we typically kind of lock in certain amount of margins...","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Correct.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...and we use the board in order to lock that in.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And so, we believe we lock in at attractive rates to the extent that margins actually improve over the quarter. It just means that we have to mark that contract to market and that's the reason why, as Juan indicated, we'll take effectively a mark-to-market loss at the end of the second quarter related to our board crush hedges there. But you're right, fundamentally with an improving margin environment, it means like for the future sales that are unhedged, that's actually very positive for us and that's the reason why we're a lot more positive for the third quarter and fourth quarter...","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...assuming the cash margins converts to the board margins there.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right. Because \u2013 I mean, you've had a real nice appreciation in your basis, you got your July meal contract at the $350 a ton, and your cash prices haven't appreciated at that rate. So, you've got a positive spread in your basis, which improves your outlook. So, the final question that I have, can you talk a little bit again about your lower tax rate guidance for the year? You had been at, I think, 28% to 30%. It's coming in lower. It sounds like it's more of a geographic mix as to where you're sourcing your earnings. Is there anything more to it than that?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's primarily geographic mix. I mean, as you know, Eric, the United States is one of the highest tax countries in the world, and so unfortunately, with weakness in terms of U.S. ethanol margins and weakness in terms of U.S. Ag Services exports, the amount of U.S. earnings relative to our total earnings has come down and that actually results in a lower tax rate.","Now, to the extent that in the back half, U.S. exports pick up dramatically beyond what we're expecting and to the extent that U.S. ethanol margins improve dramatically relative to what we expect and that could actually drive our tax rate little bit higher, but I guess, what I'm saying right now is, I think that we're going to be at a lower end of the 28% to 30% range, and maybe even slightly below that range.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then the final question on your return on invested capital. Obviously, you had a bit of shortfall below WACC, this last quarter, obviously because probably some of the more difficult conditions we've had in the Ag business in some time. Is there any sort of range of where that spread could \u2013 you probably fall short of your 200 basis point goal for the year, but can you give us a little bit of flavor where you think your ROIC could potentially be for the full year given all of the other things you're doing with your cost savings programs and other thing such as that.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just a reminder, I mean, this is a four quarter trailing average calculation, so if you recall, Eric...","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...we had a very weak Q3, very weak Q4, and a very weak Q1...","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...so it all kind of accumulates together here. Our expectation is by the end time, we get to the end of the calendar year, we should be above our annual WACC again because our earnings will be back half towards the second half of this year, based upon our views in terms of how Ag Services, how Oilseeds and how ethanol will perform for the rest of the year.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. The outlook for U.S. corn export is obviously improved given the depreciation of the dollar and the weather issues in Brazil. But are you seeing any potential offsets from China's decision to end its corn stock piling program?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Sandy. Of course, China, it's a speculation about how much product do they have, but \u2013 and when they're going to start. But certainly we feel that, over the next year, they're going to start having these auctions and bringing some of that product to the market. So certainly it could impact barley, sorghum, DDGS, some of those, and as well as corn, yeah.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. And just...","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's difficult to gauge, how much to be honest at this point in time.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, that's fair. Just a follow-up question on storage capacity. So there's been a lot of bins built in the last five years to eight years on farming at commercial elevators, what are your thoughts as to whether we will see additional storage capacity coming online. And then to what extent are growers getting creative in terms of storing corn when these bins are full?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We don't foresee at this point anymore storage capacity being built. I think, also the economies of the farming, I mean, will not allow for that to happen.","We don't believe that a lot of the off-farm storage have created or on the farm storage have created a problem for us. I think that the issue is that over time, especially when the development of the ethanol industry, the industry maybe didn't need as much storage, because a lot of the corn was locally consumed, if you will, by some of the ethanol plants. So, the environment in the agro-industry and Ag Services changes every year, and with that our business continue to adapt and sometimes we shift storage capacity, sometimes we shutdown storage capacity, or we move it around in the U.S. I don't think that there has been anything unusual to that to be honest.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrew from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Juan, just want to make sure I understand your thought process on the potential large U.S. crop that we might have based on planted acreage. I just want to understand why you think that would be helpful just given that there's ample stocks around today and we had a couple large crops in a row, so what's going to be different this year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, you are correct in the sense that we're still going to need some dislocations into that. My point is that we have better opportunity when the U.S. get to be a larger crop because we have our footprint, this is skewed more to our U.S. assets and North American assets. So, hopefully, if the U.S. get the dislocations and get the opportunity to export that, and we get to handle a big crop, if the crop is large and it comes early, maybe we get drying (1:02:58) income and all that. So, I was just talking from the perspective that a bigger crop is probably better for us given the skewed nature of our footprint towards North American assets.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Massoud with Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi Paul.","Paul Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the second quarter. I mean, and get a sense of what it is that you're expecting for the second quarter, specifically for Ag Services. You've got, I mean, you mentioned a potential for some volume increase, but we have seen crop prices rally, we have seen some marketing and farmers selling crops. I mean, is there still a significant amount of crop still left in the bin and on-farm storage, and if we keep seeing the dollar weaken or even just sort of stay at these levels, I mean, is there a potential for both volumes and margins to surprise in Ag Services in the second quarter?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Paul, I guess the main driver is going to be kind of volume. Traditionally for Ag Services, the Q2 is a lower volume quarter compared to Q1 and that's just simply because of \u2013 for Ag Services, the more U.S. centric nature of the footprint. And so, as Juan indicated, exports generally are 20% to 30% lower from a volume perspective, Q2 versus Q1. So even though I mean there is some macro variables out there, which would suggest that global environment may be improving. All we're saying is for Ag Services specifically, our expectation is the earnings for Q2 will be actually fairly similar to where we ended up in Q1.","Paul Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","It makes sense. I guess what I'm having trouble reconciling is that, part of the reason I \u2013 obviously I've always thought that Q2 was lower was because farmers did all their selling in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. And this year \u2013 or in \u2013 and this season, we didn't see that. So, there's a lot more sitting on the sidelines that never got moved or is it more of a demand issue in your mind, where the demand is just not there, and so you have to wait until the second half to see the volumes move.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Paul, I think with the recent rise in the board, you're seeing some of the farmers actually being more aggressive in terms of selling. The issue is in terms of our movement through an entire system, particularly our export system that is going to remain very weak in Q2.","Paul Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, maybe a little bit on some of the global competitors, I mean, I think, you said specifically with Argentina. They've got a lot of soybeans that could last throughout the year, but corn and wheat as far as exports go, they may very well run out of some of that excess supply mid-year. Is that still the view, I mean?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, generally the Argentine farmer has been selling their corn and their wheat. And that's again a function of the fact that the export taxes had been reduced down to zero.","Paul Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then I guess, just lastly. I think, we saw some news report come out recently that some industry groups based in D.C. representing some of the grain handlers were pushing back on some of the new soybean seeds that were being sold. Do you have any comments on that? I mean, could you maybe add a little bit of color from experience when \u2013 the last time there was a seed that was approved domestically, but not approved by a buyer. I think, this time we're talking about Europe not having accepted a new soybean seed. I mean, can you talk a little bit about what's going on there, and maybe add some color for that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Paul. I mean, you mentioned it. We've seen this before and we've seen the impact that that causes to us, grain handlers and also to the farmers, and because of the import \u2013 importance of exports to American agriculture and American farmers, our policy is not to accept any commodity that contains a trait that is approved here, but not in the major markets, and we continue to do so, and I think that you heard that the industry is very aligned in that sense and it's just to protect the competitiveness of U.S. exports.","Paul Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. I appreciate all the color, guys. Thanks a lot.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","There are no further questions.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results. Then Juan will review the drivers of our performance in the quarter and provide an update on our scorecard. And then they will take your questions.","Please turn to slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.77. That's 40% higher than the year ago period. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $883 million. Adjusted ROIC of 9.5% was 290 basis points above our cost of capital.","In the first quarter, the ADM team demonstrated their ability to leverage the strength of our diversified business model. The Oilseeds team capitalized on favorable market conditions and delivered outstanding results with strong performances in each region. In Ag Services, our recently created global trade desk or GTD platform, drove higher merchandise volumes. Our new WILD flavors and Specialty Ingredients business was off to a great start toward achieving the cost in revenue synergies we identified last year.","Together, this performance has helped deliver a good quarter overall, even as slower industry ethanol margins limited earnings in corn and the strong dollar limited U.S. grain exports.","We have continued to advance the strategic plan we shared at our December Investor Day. In the area of optimizing the core, we announced the acquisition of a Belgian oil bottling business, helping us reach a wider customer base and creating a new output for our European crushing assets.","And the WFSI team has been working with customers as they developed and launched new products using SCI, WILD and ADM ingredients. We have more than 200 joint customer engagements building a pipeline of more than 400 projects, resulting already in more than 30 revenue synergy wins across a number of regions and businesses unit in Q1 alone.","In the area of driving operational efficiencies, we have already identified more than $200 million in run rate savings opportunities toward our goal of $550 million in five years. And in the area of strategic expansion, the Corn Processing business expanded in high-growth geographies with the acquisition of the remaining stake of corn wet mills in Bulgaria and Turkey and an increased stake in a facility in Hungary.","I will provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray Young","Thanks, Juan and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.77, up 40% from the $0.55 last year. Excluding specified items and also spoon net timing effects, adjusted statement operating profit was $883 million, up $94 million.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29% compared to 27% in the first quarter of the prior year. For calendar year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range.","Our trailing four-quarter-average adjusted ROIC of 9.5% improved from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter and also significantly improved by 250 basis points from the 7.0% at the end of the first quarter last year. The 9.5% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WAC of 8.0% as reflected in the graph on slide 19 in the Appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points overall WACC.","In the first quarter, our trailing four-quarter-average economic value added or EVA was $742 million, based upon adjusted earnings in the annual WACC, up $581 million from 2014. On chart 18 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $2 million pretax credit or less than $0.01 after-tax. There are no other adjustments for the quarter.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I would like to highlight some of the unique items that impacted our quarterly results.","Corn Processing adjusted operating profit of $127 million excludes approximately $14 million hedged in the effectiveness charges, split relatively evenly amongst file products in sweeteners and starches. In oilseeds, adjusted operating profit of $483 million excludes approximately $14 million of cocoa hedged timing effects in this quarter. As a reminder, we will also continue to have our cocoa and chocolate businesses as part of our segment reporting results in oilseeds until we have closed on the sales sometime later in 2015.","They are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements due to the lack of materiality of the operations to our overall results.","Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients or WFSI for short, is reported as its own segment for the first time this quarter. The segment includes the two businesses we acquired in 2014, WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. or SCI as well as certain specialty ingredients businesses that were previously reported in ADM's three other segments.","For purposes of comparison to prior results, the year ago quarter's segment operating profit for Ag Services, Corn and Oilseeds remove the earnings of the businesses now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist with your analysis, we conclude a chart in the Appendix that recasts 2014 segment quarterly results in the new segments.","In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and allocated corporate costs were higher, due to increased GAAP pension expenses relating to changes in discount rates and mortality tables and increased investments in our ERP program, as well as very strategic projects and M&A and divestment activities. In addition, I want to point out that a strong U.S. dollar and weakness in other currencies such as the euro and the Brazilian real do not have a material impact on ADM's overall first quarter net earnings.","On one hand, the strong U.S. dollar did have some negative impact on the competitiveness of our U.S. export programs and our WFSI segment also had some negative impacts in terms of export competitiveness and earnings translation from Europe.","On the other hand, the weaker euro and real had a positive impact on our fixed costs around the world, relative to revenue streams we're receiving. Also, the weaker real motivated Brazilian farmers to sell, thereby benefiting our origination business in Brazil.","So, on balance with the puts and takes, the net impact was not material. Going forward, we do not expect the currency impact to have a material impact on our overall results for the rest of the year.","I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the Appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $17.5 billion, down from last year's $20.7 billion. This significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues. But this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower.","So the key for us is management spread between the revenues and cost of goods sold which is a core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing ADM. I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements in the prior year do not include the revenues and the cost of WILD and SCI which transaction closed in the fourth quarter of last year.","Turning to cash flow statement on slide 6 which shows the cash flows for the three months ending March 31, 2015 compared to the same period the prior year, we generated $577 million from operations before working capital changes in the quarter, significantly higher than Q1 last year. Total capital spending for the quarter was $244 million, up from the prior year. For 2015, we're estimating capital spending in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is higher than our $0.9 billion spending in 2014 which you may recall we reduced after the WILD acquisition to assess capital spend avoidance opportunities.","As a result, some 2014 spending shifted into 2015. We also have some additional spending for our ERP program and cost reduction projects as well as our ramp-up of our specialty protein projects spending in Brazil, our Fibersol projects in China and the U.S., our lecithin projects in Germany and India.","During the quarter, we spent $566 million to repurchase about 12 million shares towards our 2015 target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count was 639 million diluted shares outstanding, down approximately 24 million from the 663 million at the same time one year ago. Our total return capital to shareholders for the quarter, including dividends, was over $700 million.","Our first quarter cash flows are consistent with our 2015 calendar year targets of capital allocations, namely CapEx of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, approximately $700 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. And all this is consistent with the balanced capital allocation framework we set forth at our December Investor Day.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31 for both 2015 and 2014 which remains very strong. Our operating working capital of $8.1 billion was down $3.4 billion from the year ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1.6 billion related to lower inventory prices including the translation impacts, about $1.4 billion related to lower inventory quantities and a decrease of about $0.4 billion in other working capital, primarily related to the reclassification of working capital for our global cocoa and chocolate businesses under the held for sale accounting.","Total debt was about $6.4 billion, resulting in net debt balance that is debt less cash of $5.1 billion up from the 2014 net debt level of $4.1 billion, in part reflecting the fourth-quarter cash flows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI. Our shareholders' equity of $18.8 billion is $1.3 billion lower than the level last year, with the cumulative translation account impact of about $1.6 billion lower due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.7 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you had available cash, we had access to $7 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?","Juan Luciano","Thanks, Ray. Please turn to slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $883 million of operating profits excluding the specified items. This 12% year-over-year increase in underlying segment operating profit demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model and the team's ability to leverage that model.","In the first quarter, the team capitalized on great opportunities when they continued to advance our strategic plan. Sequentially of course, the quarter follows a very strong fourth quarter and with normal seasonality, underlying segment operating profits decreased. Now I will review the performance of each segment.","Starting on slide 9, in the first quarter, Ag Services results improved 37% over the last year. Merchandising and handling saw limited U.S. export competitiveness more than offset by continued improvement in international merchandising where we saw the benefit of our GTD with merchandise volumes increasing. In Transportation, we saw an increasing demand for northbound U.S. bar trade which mostly offset the decrease in southbound demand. Milling and other results improved, due to our strong margins for flour, grain and feed. Please turn to slide 10.","Corn Processing results declined in the quarter. In sweeteners and starches, our underlying North American business is doing well with higher margins and volumes in Q1. This was offset by lower contributions from core products, reduced equity earnings from joint ventures and the start-up costs related to the TNG sweetener facility.","And in Bioproducts, earnings were lower due to lower ethanol production volumes and weaker industry margins. Supply and demand imbalances challenged industry ethanol margins most of the quarter though conditions and margins have been improving since late March.","Let me explain our corn results a bit further. We said before that we make decisions that will achieve the best overall results for ADM. This quarter, with low industry margins, we made a decision to run our ethanol operations for margins rather than volumes. That helped our earnings in Bioproducts. It also had the effect of reducing our production of core products which limited our earnings in sweeteners and starches. Bottom line, the impact to our overall core business was positive. Slide 11 please.","The Oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter. Crushing and origination had great performances in each region. In North America, the team demonstrated the value of our strong footprint and our expected destination supply chain. Eight to 10 months ago, they determined Q1 will see an extended North American export window. They got maintenance out of the way and positioned soybean supplier so when the margins arrived, they were able to run hard until the seasonal shift to South America came.","In Europe, the team demonstrated the value of the swing capacity of our crush plants; when soybean crush margins were more than double canola crush margins, we would run the plants hard and crush a lot of beans. And in South America, the team prepared our network for a large, fast harvest and when the strong dollar drove Brazilian farmers to sell their beans, we were ready to handle the growth of strong margins.","In refining, packaging, biodiesel and other, lower biodiesel margins in North America and weaker European demand limited results. South American biodiesel results improved with these seven implementation. And in North America, our Stratus bottle oil joint venture generated strong results with good volumes. Results from Asia rose primarily on well mark improved performance. Slide 12 please.","In their first reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit delivered a great start. As I mentioned earlier, the team has been working with a wide range of customers as they develop products using ingredients from all of ADM's business units. Globally, the Flavors business is off to a strong start for the year.","On a constant currency basis, while EMEA business performed particularly well, this is a quarter in which demand is seasonally slower and results were limited by Forex headwinds. We also had mark-to-market losses on currency hedges for future capital purchases for the specialty protein plants in Brazil. The project itself is benefiting from the weakened real versus the dollar. This is an exciting business with an energetic team and they are off to an absolutely great start.","Now on slide 13, I would like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at the invested in December. It lists the actions we're taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress in the quarter; I'll discuss a few.","In Ag Services, we launched ARTCO Stevedoring, adding a wide range of services to our ARTCO barge operation. With ADM's logistical expertise and global reach, we provide customers along the lower Mississippi a range of services that nobody else offers.","As I mentioned, we saw the benefit of our GTD platform that we developed following the top four acquisitions. And today, we're announcing that we have agreed to acquire full ownership of our joint venture complexes at Konstantin Romania, a Black Sea port at the mouth of the Danube. This acquisition builds on the investments we have made in our Danube River network since 2011 and further strengthens our origination and transportation capabilities in Eastern Europe.","In Corn, we sold our lactic acid business, exiting a business for which we didn't see a path to acceptable returns in a reasonable time frame. And we acquired the remainder of the Bulgarian and Turkish wet mills and expanded our stake in the Hungary plant, positioning ourselves wells for when EU sugar production quotas are lifted.","We continued construction of our feed premix plant in Nanjing and this morning we're announcing plans to build a fourth feed plant in China in Zhangzhou, as well as one in Minnesota. In Oilseeds, we're working with Cardell and Olin on the divestitures of our chocolate and cocoa businesses. We're targeting closing both in Q3, subject to final approvals and completion of transitional activities. We agreed to acquire an oil bottling business in Belgium. This acquisition will provide another demand stream for our Oilseeds Processing operations, reducing our reliance on biodiesel and growing our packaged oil business.","And as we mentioned on the last call, we're creating a joint venture to quadruple the size of our port in northern Brazil, improving our ability to export from this increasingly productive region.","In WFSI, relating to the WILD acquisition, we remain on track to deliver \u20ac100 million in synergies over the next three years. And we're on track for $0.10 to $0.15 accretion in 2015, although this will likely be in the lower end of the range due to the strong dollar.","And we continue to advance our construction project in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S. and in the area of driving operational efficiencies, as I mentioned, we have identified more than $200 million in run rate savings toward our goal of $550 million in five years.","As part of this effort, we launched a global improvement initiative involving colleagues across all regions and businesses, evaluating every aspect of our business for improvement opportunities. In the first quarter, we implemented projects that will achieve about $60 million in annual run rate savings.","We will update you on our scorecard each quarter and over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns. So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We continue to be excited about 2015. We came into the year with a lot of positive momentum which we expect to continue through the year. With early plans in progress and long-term weather forecasts, suggest a good likelihood for excellent U.S. growth. A large harvest combined with big carryout's of corn, soybeans and wheat, could give us opportunities for very good carriers at the end of the year.","Those, combined with expected solid global demand, point to very high utilization of our storage, transportation and processing assets in North America and Europe later this year. U.S. gasoline consumption continues to improve. That will translate into stronger domestic demand for ethanol. These, combined with strong exports, will keep our assets running hard, especially as we move through the summer driving season.","Demand for sweeteners and flavors will benefit from the seasonal pickup in Northern Hemisphere beverage consumption. The WFSI team is off to a great start. They will continue to deliver synergies and we're confident they will meet the 2015 accretion goals.","We're also excited by our customer engagements. Every business unit has been working with existing customers, as well as new customers who are collaborating across the organization more than ever before, working on new types of projects, delivering wins, improving margins. And the team will continue to deliver our clear and aggressive strategic plan. The plan that is already contributing to our bottom line, a plan that returned 9.5% this quarter, a plan that will continue to grow our EVA.","With that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Evan Morris with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Evan Morris","Just a first question on ethanol -- just, you talked about the margin outlook improving since late March. A lot of the work that we do on it and conversations that we've had suggest that the industry is running it -- operating profit per gallon in sort of that mid-20s right now and just wanted to get a sense as to what you are seeing.","Is that consistent with where ADM is running now? And just based on information that you have in your outlook, where do you see margins tracking and sort of maybe for the full year on average for exiting the year, just a little bit more context about where you are now and where you see it going over the next quarter or two.","Juan Luciano","We're constructive on ethanol margins. You think about it, April has been a relatively big month for shutdowns as people saw some of the margins were relatively low in March. Some people anticipated some of the seasonal shutdowns.","So we see margins improving since the late part of March. We see this with optimism; we see a demand in the U.S. growing, due to lower gasoline prices about 2% to 3% per year. That would put the industry around 138 billion, 140 billion gallons of gasoline, that and the increased exports. We exported very well in Q1. If you look at the January and February export estimate, they are annualized around 1 billion gallons because we exported in those two months, 152 million gallons. If you take the last week of April, that export annualized was around also in the billion range.","So we see exports for the year between 800 million and maybe a little bit north of that for the year. Plus maybe 13.8 billion to 14 billion gallons of domestic gasoline demand. We see very high-capacity utilization so we face this season with a lot of optimism in regards to ethanol.","Evan Morris","Are you -- is what you are seeing with ethanol margins -- in the industry right now, it seems to be around that mid-20s. Is that -- is $0.20 per gallon on an operating profit basis, is that pretty consistent with what you're seeing right now within ADM?","Juan Luciano","It's in the ballpark. It's moving, but it's in the ballpark, yes.","Evan Morris","Okay. And then second, you kind of touched on it a little bit but just I wonder if you can put just a little more context around -- you had the record crop in North America last year. South America looks strong. Early commentary in the North American planting suggests another big crop.","So, I know there's a lot of things that can change the industry dynamics pretty quickly, but you talked about the positive outlook in the fourth quarter, given some of these dynamics -- through the fourth quarter given some of these dynamics, but can you -- some context on -- as you sit here today and you take a look at how the rest of the year shapes up, can you give us some context as to do you anticipate this is going to be a much bigger year than last year? I know things are headed in the right direction, but if you can put some context about sort of the magnitude and how strong this year could be?","Juan Luciano","Yes, obviously we started the year strong with Ag Services delivering 37% more profit than the same quarter last year. And as we see the good planting as you describe and plentiful of crops and the stocks around the world, we see a good transition to the next crop with plentiful of inventories that will provide carriers opportunity and there is a lot of business to do ahead of us, so the Oilseed -- the Ag Services team, the Grain team is preparing for all that. It's preparing our assets, it's preparing commercially to do this. And we expect the second half to be very strong for them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","Maybe first on Oilseeds which was truly a tremendous quarter, can we talk through the forward outlook there? As we wind down the North American crush, how much of that can shift to South America? Presumably, it's a bit of a one-time exceptional beat, but thoughts about how sustainable the oilseed outlook is as you move through the balance of the year, considering where soft seed margins are in Europe and your South American exposures?","Juan Luciano","I would say, Adam, the Oilseed teams that you described have an outstanding performance but not everything was hitting on eight cylinders. As you described, oilseed was kind of not very profitable and biodiesel has some headwinds as well. So, most of the profits were concentrated in soybean that has very high-capacity utilization around the world.","As you describe the shift starts from North America to South America, so South American crushing margins still are good and we crush a lot of soybeans in Europe, taking advantage of our swing capacity and we're going to see a little bit of softening of that as we see every year with the enormous seasonality of that.","But the business is running very, very well, it implemented a lot of improvements and we're seeing those improvements coming through in the P&L. So overall in the year, we continue to feel very strongly about the year that Oilseeds is going to have.","Adam Samuelson","And within the -- specifically, you report your South American origination business in Oilseeds that you talked about a strong March as the real weakened. It's since appreciated through April. Has farmer selling continued in South America? Are you seeing that slow? And maybe the same comments on farmers selling in the U.S.","Juan Luciano","Yes, so slightly different situations. In the U.S., the farmer is concentrating in planting right now and rightfully so, so it has been little commercialization. In South America is the dynamic you describe and I think Ray explained in his commentary which is very much dependent on the real-dollar relationship and it's been very volatile this last couple of weeks, so it just changes us -- the farmers see an opportunity to sell, given the real. So I will say we will continue to be volatile at this point.","Adam Samuelson","If I can squeeze one more just on biodiesel, U.S. and Europe. Any thoughts or signs that could improve as you go through the balance of the year or expectations for that business moving forward?","Juan Luciano","Normally, as we get into the summer weather, we see a little bit more activity, obviously. Brazil was good with the D7 that helped our profitability a little bit there and in the U.S., a lot will depend on the expectations of June 1 and RVOs and all that, that announcement. So at this point in time, both businesses are challenged.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Could you dig a little bit deeper into your revenue synergies on the WILD Flavor side? You said 30 revenue synergy wins in the quarter. Just give us some examples of what those actually are.","Juan Luciano","Yes, it's difficult in this area to provide concrete examples, Ann, because obviously we respect confidentiality of our customers and all these are innovations for them to increase their revenue and differentiate themselves. But we're excited about it because we got two pipelines here going on.","One is the pipeline that we inherited from WILD themselves, but it was very robust as they continue to grow earnings and revenue every year. And then, the synergy pipeline that we got by mixing basically the ingredients that ADM provided. Remember, we contributed $1.5 billion of revenue worth of ingredients into this new division.","And then the product that SCI brings and also the product at WILD -- we had several conferences for innovation where we had customer teams working together with their customers and that's when we generated the pipeline that I described. Again, we measured it in terms of engagements and obviously we measure in terms of potential revenue and margin.","This is the first quarter, obviously, of this business running, so the best -- the first order of business, obviously, is to make sure that we keep our customer momentum, so all the team is very much divided in two sets of people. The people that are working on the cost revenue -- the cost synergy and the people that are continuing to be engaged with customers.","We're very happy with our engagement with the customers, our combined culturally if you will. The combination of SCI, WILD and ADM has been very, very good. People are working together seamlessly and I think customers have seen only benefits from this. So we wanted to report on that. Off to a great start, customers seeing the opportunities and we're seeing the opportunities to bring more of our products to our solution.","Ann Duignan","And then switching gears a little bit, could you comment on the rail car spenders? I know that your ethanol non-jacketed [indiscernible] probably don't need to be retrofitted until 2023, but does the slowdown on the speed or any of the other rules have any impact on your ethanol business in the near term?","Juan Luciano","Yes, obviously this is a recent proposal so we continue to study. At this point, although this did not conform exactly with our public position, we're pleased that we appear to have a little bit more of a longer timeline than maybe crude oil.","But we're a little bit concerned about this reduction in speed because not only will speed -- just transportation of oil and ethanol, but will slow down the whole system. So hopefully, we're still going to have some discussions with the government about this area.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And when would you expect a decision to be made or an outcome from those discussions?","Juan Luciano","I really don't know and I will be venturing at this point. I don't know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask about the oilseed crush margins again. Juan, right now we're seeing CBOT crush margins around $0.69 per bushel, that's down from like well over $1.00. Put into perspective just how good the Q1 margins were on crush and then what I'm really trying to get after is it feels like ADM should be down quite substantially in the second quarter on Oilseed Processing simply because moving from Northern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere and Q1 was just a remarkable result on the crush side. Can you give me your comments?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I would say the thing that you noted the strength of the crush margins in North America. And our team played very well. But I think what also happened is that normally during March, you see a transition already to South America. And I think in this case what we had is probably the full March that you see here in the North American result.","So yes, there is a shift that we normally see and we're going to see a little bit of a slowdown in the earnings of oilseeds in the second quarter as we shift to South America. South America, both Paraguay and Brazil, we don't have crushing in Argentina, but Paraguay and Brazil continue to be a good crushing margin. And then we're going to have, we're going to pick up a little bit of the exports from the grain origination part that we'll report in oilseeds. So I would say yes, with the normal seasonality from Q1 to Q2, not a significant or spectacular decline, I would say.","David Driscoll","And then just to follow on that, Q4 last year and Q1 this year were terrific because of how tight the conditions are in oilseed crush. Is there any reason that would it reoccur in the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of next year on just the basic presumption that the crops are good? So assuming the crops are good, the crush margin that we saw these last couple of quarters were terrific, but I would expect those to repeat. Is that a reasonable thought process?","Juan Luciano","Yes, David. I think that there is a tight capacity -- this industry continues to grow. And there hasn't been much capacity added, so you will continue to see those dynamics in which -- when we get to export a lot and we have very robust domestic demand, that presents very good crush margins.","This is a global demand story. It continues to grow the protein consumption. And also, don't forget that as we were exporting a lot of DBGs to China that basically increased the domestic demand for soybean meal for us. So crushing went very, very well and we think that will continue over the year.","David Driscoll","On ethanol, can you discuss how much of your ethanol business has been hedged in the second quarter?","Juan Luciano","I normally tell you that we hedge. as a matter of principle something between 25% and 75%, depending on how we see the conditions. I would say that we're constructive in margins and margins have been recovering. So that probably indicates that, as you can understand, we're probably in the soft side of that, but I don't want to disclose that much our tactics going into Q2.","David Driscoll","Kind of same question, though, related to Q3 and Q4 on ethanol. Do you have much visibility on margins there or is it same story? It's only just improving now, so you would be on the lower side of normal hedge patterns.","Juan Luciano","I would say we like the prospects through the summer; we like the way exports are reacting. Ethanol continues to be, clearly by a big margin, the lowest octane enhancer around the world and that continues to bring export markets to the U.S. The U.S. is a reliable supplier. So we continue to be optimistic about that.","We know that plants run a little bit softer during the summer and the driving season is upon us. So we have several months ahead of us with potentially good margins.","David Driscoll","And then one last question, in Ag Services, do you think that we will see better North American flow because farmers have been, I think, a little bit reluctant to sell some of their crop, particularly corn? Bottom line is, is there a good corn flow expected in the second quarter that would be a little bit larger than normal?","Juan Luciano","I don't know if in Q2, but we're optimistic about the second half. We believe that we have a lot of business ahead of us, both in South America and in North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Massoud with Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Massoud","I was wondering if you would talk a little bit more about the ethanol exports. You had mentioned that FX gave you some trouble as far as the grain exports out of the U.S., but the number that you gave annualized was close to 1 billion gallons and before, you were talking about flat. Now it seems that you are implying a year-over-year increase. At some point do you start to see a strong U.S. dollar, weak oil pricing having any kind of an impact on U.S. exports of ethanol?","Juan Luciano","Well, I described it before, Paul, that ethanol continues to be, by a big margin, a big -- the cheapest oxygenator out there. If you think of ethanol in the range of $1.60 to $1.70, then next oxygenator is about $2.50. So there is still a big incentive out there. So we haven't seen, even with all the strength of the dollar, any reduction in our exports of ethanol.","So at this point in time, we continue to look at 800 million gallons this year. I just was reflecting on the numbers that were posted on the January and February exports and that happens to be annualized to 1 billion. We continue to be somewhere in that range.","Obviously we continue to look at new markets and there are several mandates around the world that are being implemented and there is more than 3 billion gallons of MTB that needs to be replaced. So we're optimistic about that and that, over the last two years, has been a very strong market for us and seem to continue to grow, Q2 exports, they are probably going to be larger than Q1.","Paul Massoud","Switching gears just a little bit over to WILD flavors and the \u20ac100 million in synergies that you're talking about. I believe you said in the past that you are expecting that over three years. I'm just wondering if maybe the FX headwinds might delay some of the material results to years two and three. Or do you still expect to see some accretion, in maybe year one?","Juan Luciano","Yes, we do expect accretion year one. The synergies -- normally in these cases, Paul, happen that you get the cost synergies upfront because that's when the integration happens. And then at the same time, you start working with customers in qualifying products and developing new products and then they go to shelf life, testing and all that.","So the revenue synergies are more backend-loaded and the cost synergies are more front end-loaded in these projects. But at this point in time, we're probably running at or a little bit ahead of schedule in that sense.","Paul Massoud","And my last question is just on the Brazilian transport strike that we saw in the first quarter. It doesn't look like you had any material impacts in your numbers, but were there any effects and do you see anything lingering into the second quarter from that? Thanks.","Juan Luciano","Yes, no. This time, the Brazilian strike happened almost a little bit ahead of the harvest, if you will. So it didn't have a material impact to us. We had a little bit of an attempt last week again, that brought a little bit of an issue in Mato Grosso, but nothing significant that we can report. So no impact, I will say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","Just a question on Argentina, I think its Brazil as well. My understanding is that there is -- at the grain elevator, there's a thing called the point of delivery system, whereby originators such as yourself will test soybeans to see if they are biotech; and if they are, you collect a royalty fee that then is shared with the biotech seed manufacturer.","I think there have been problems with this in Brazil in the past, but I've been reading that there are issues with it in Argentina. So could you just talk a bit about what those dynamics are? Is it a meaningful amount of earnings for you? And are you having any discussions with the Argentine government about this or just sort of what the state of play is?","Juan Luciano","Yes, no, Vince, I'm aware of the issue. This is just a matter of putting the grain industry in a position to have to collect royalties if you will or licenses. So it doesn't have a margin impact on us, but yes, it's a little bit of a domestic dispute and since there are other companies on the other side involved in this, I would rather don't comment and let the guys solve it themselves in Argentina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam","Juan, could you share with us your global trade desk? How you're merchandising volume differently and how it actually did help you increase volumes and is that volume increase sustainable?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I think as you recall, and we were, as a team, unhappy with the performance we were having with Top Four and we needed to fix that. That was not only providing low recurrence, but a lot of volatility to our earnings to where we were running it.","Part of that was created by inefficiencies between interface between Top Four and ADM. Part of that, it was because of a blow to the structure, if you will, that was increasing our fixed costs. So when we bought the 20% of Top Four, we brought both companies together and we moved some of the people to roles to Geneva and that allowed us to, first of all, have a more coordinated view of the market between the origination and the destination that Top Four provided. We had better utilization of our infrastructure, our logistics and certainly, reduced the cost of the whole operation, so it's a more profitable operation. It doesn't have that many fixed costs.","So I think that overall, we improved the volumes because we have better coverage, but we also increased the margins out of that since we have lower cost. So I think the overall end-to-end supply chain that you hear me talking from origination to the destination market -- that's what the GTD has brought to us. And we should continue to see improvements in to these. And you see, this is a very true reflection.","Ag Services with North America not being able to export that much because of the strong dollar still grew earnings 37% year over year which is a significant improvement. And a lot of that is because of this implementation.","Farha Aslam","And so is this improvement captured in that $550 million improvement target? Is that the types of projects that will be in that 550 number?","Juan Luciano","I would say that's probably a different bucket. The $550 million are more operational improvements. This is more like a strategic portfolio management. We will count it in another bucket. So I will say only maybe a tiny bit maybe in the $550 million, but you shouldn't deduct from the $550 million of these. I think we're going to be the $550 million without counting this.","Farha Aslam","And then you announced several small divestitures and acquisitions and notably many of them were either greater ownerships of ports or expansion of ports. Could you help us frame what earnings you drive from ports and how we should think about your investments in ports?","Juan Luciano","Yes, well, ports are strategic points. They are -- at times, if they become a choking point, they can be a big source of either your earnings or your losses depending if you own it or you don't. What we're trying to do, if you think some of the announcements we made, we made the announcement of Eaststarch, for example where we have more ownership now of Eastern European assets and then we announced this morning also [Technical Difficulty] the Port of Constanta where we'd take full ownership of that.","This is to continue to complement our value chain and be in charge of all those different parts in the value chain that allow us to make small margins in many, many points as we touch the grain here all the way from the origination to the processing.","So we control many, many ports around the world and as I said before, I think at times they become the bottleneck. And you don't want to be held hostage to somebody else owning that and having to bus all the profit there. So to the extent that it makes capital sense because obviously, they are expensive. We tried in places where we have the full supply chain, we tried to own them.","Farha Aslam","So your investment will smooth out your earnings, accelerate earnings? How should we think about that?","Juan Luciano","I think it should expand our earnings.","Farha Aslam","And final question is in Argentina, there's an election coming up. Do you expect Argentine soy mills to start crushing post the election and how do you anticipate that impacting global crush margins?","Juan Luciano","Yes, the Argentinians have been selling a little bit more as well. But yes, a lot of people expect that if there is a change in government in Argentina, there might come an evaluation and that may prompt a little bit more aggressive farmer selling. At one point in time, we will fill the soybean mills from Argentina, obviously more probably in Europe than otherwise for us. So it's hard to speculate on the result on election to be honest, Farha, but that will be one of the potential scenarios.","Farha Aslam","So, that would be more a 2016 event?","Juan Luciano","Yes, the elections in Argentina, Farha, I think they happen in October and I think the government changed like in December 10 or something like that. So whether the new government decides to have the evaluation in December or to move it to 2016, it's probably more a 2016 impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Just wanted to go back to the comment you made about how your sweeteners and starches results were impacted by running the ethanol at a lower rate during the quarter. Just wondering in the past, you talked about shifting grind capacity. Was this the dry mills that were rushed down or the wet mills? Thanks.","Juan Luciano","Yes, we look at the overall pool of assets that we have and so I'm not going to disclose granularity around what assets we take down or not, but I think as I said, I think it's important for you to consider that we're always going to look at both to maximize the margin coming out of every bushel that we grind. So sometimes, that benefits buyer products to the detriment of sweeteners and starches like in this case. It doesn't happen that often, but in this case, we thought it was material enough that we should mention it.","Michael Piken","And then within your wet mill operation, how much flex capacity is there? I recognize you sell hundreds of products, but within the wet milling process, how much of the grind could be shifted theoretically from ethanol toward high glucose or another type of product?","Juan Luciano","That's a very strategic an important number that I rather don't disclose, Michael. We have the ability to produce between 20 and 30 products but how much can we shift from one extreme to the other is a very strategic number. I would rather don't disclose.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak Research. Your line is open.","Tim Tiberio","One of your competitors had described the specialty protein market in the U.S. as a bit more competitive in the first half. Would you agree with that comment? And is this, I think, a situation where maybe whey protein prices have come down? As dairy production has increased, are you seeing increased price competition or flexibility in that space?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Tim, let me tell you what happened to us. And I don't know what happened to competitors. But what happened to us is that we use a lot of our North American capacity to supply the rest of the world. And because of the dollar strength and some emerging market weaknesses if you will, we exported less.","That might have prompted that more volume actually stayed domestically and that might have put some pressure on margins domestically. But the biggest impact we felt was we didn't have the pull from exports this quarter.","We're working on that and we're solving that and some of that -- some of that was also customers around the world looking at soybean prices coming down and decided to go a little bit hand to mouth to see how low can they become. So we're seeing that turning a little bit now. But that's the impact we saw, Tim.","Tim Tiberio","And then my second question, with the buyout of the JV with Tate and Lyle, I know they've talked about that venture requiring more capital investments over time than they were comfortable with. Can you frame up what the additional CapEx requirements may be over the next couple of years after you've consolidated that?","Juan Luciano","Yes, the issue is it doesn't require capital investments. Capital investments is a choice if we want to grow that capacity. The reality is, the U.S. uses 92% of high-fructose corn syrup versus 8% of sugar for soda, if you will. Eastern Europe uses 28% of high-fructose corn syrup versus 72% of sugar. So the opportunity to grow that is enormous.","So sure, if you want to capitalize on that, you need capacity, you need capital to expand capacity. But we will only do it on the back of very strong returns that will make that expansion make sense. So, we don't have a must. We can run this for cash flow or for cash as long as we want until we decide that we want to expand.","We're not going to expand day one. Day one is all going to be about integrating this to our footprint and taking advantages of re-managing that growth asset and reintegrating those assets with our grain and our transportation business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Ken Zaslow","Just two questions. One is, can you frame this quarter as a quarter in terms of earnings power? Because there was a lot of puts and takes. Is the return characteristics and the overall performance, is this kind of what you'll be thinking about for a longer term number? What would be the major changes to enhance your earnings from this type of quarterly rate?","Juan Luciano","First quarter is not traditionally a very strong quarter for us; especially from an ethanol perspective, it's a low demand quarter. Certainly biodiesel didn't run as expected. So I will say we still believe that there is a strong ability for ADM to improve returns and results from this kind of level. We don't think that this is top, we don't think that this is maximized not even for oilseeds that you can say that have an outstanding quarter.","Some of their divisions -- as I said, all the softest side, all Europe didn't quite perform that well. Biodiesel is not performing great. We couldn't export a lot from North America from a grain perspective, so our earnings from grains was subdued. Certainly we didn't have any margins in ethanol, so I don't think that this was a spectacular quarter from what the market could give us.","I think that, given what the market could give us, the team executed very, very well and we continue to be excited about the implementation of our strategic blueprint. Our strategic plan. That continues to bring strength, because it comes from improving our operations, from having better facilities, from divesting things that we don't like. That I announced today, we divested the lactic acid business.","It's not a significant thing, but it continues to show the commitment of management that there are no sacred cows here. Everybody needs to present a credible forecast for returns to be part of the integrated business. And I think we continue to be excited about the strength of our plan and the way our company is executing with a very good consistency, I would say. So I think there is upside from here, Ken. That will be my summary.","Ken Zaslow","Okay. And then my second question is just on more detail is, could you give us a little bit of outlook on the European crush outlook? What's going well there, when the crops coming in, just a little bit more because it seems like margins in Europe have been a little softer and when do they turn -- how do you think to them?","Juan Luciano","Yes, so Q1, we shifted as much as we could to soybean crushing as margins were so much better. Obviously now, the market has gotten a little bit better but also Argentinean soybean has started to show up so now it's going to become a little bit tougher. And I think from a softer perspective, we probably need to wait until July or sometime later on for us to see an improvement there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Glad to hear that lactic acid is not a sacred cow. Sounds like a great title for a note. But I wanted to know HFCS demand -- certainly I don't think anyone would say it's great domestically, but I think supply has been cut back in my understanding is that that has tightened up the spot markets quite a bit.","You didn't report very strong results profit-wise in the quarter, but how do you think this bodes for future periods? Do you think this will be a -- do you think you can do better in future periods, especially when contracts roll over?","Juan Luciano","I think I said it in my remarks, we posted an increase in profitability and the underlying business in sweeteners and starch, driven by good volumes and profit margins. It was offset by part of this lack of controller credits because of the decisions we made to run ethanol for margins and also decrease earnings from the joint ventures and the one times from the Tianjin and the start-up costs.","Think about the Tianjin plant. We have a full world scale plant waiting to get approval, so you have all the fixed costs and some of the variable costs that we're making product. No revenue, no cash flow from that plant. So that's impacting the business.","But I agree with you, margins for spot business are a little bit tighter and a little bit higher and we have a combination of contracts. Contracts that were done before the announcement of some of the shutdowns, that were done at previous years' margin on some businesses that were performed after that which are at better numbers. But we expect the profitability of sweeteners and starches from now on to improve as some of these one-offs will be eliminated.","Robert Moskow","Juan, I didn't -- but sweeteners and starches -- once you get Eastern Europe, the full accountability of the profits there in you numbers and then you get China up and running, can you give us a sense of what those two projects would add incrementally to your normal run rate? Because I think I and others always think of this division as just being North America and that's it.","Juan Luciano","Yes and I would rather maybe give you some perspective on that maybe on the next call. We still want to get the feeling of getting all the approvals in China and we need to get our hands on the Eaststarch and we didn't get 100% of Eaststarch, so some of Eaststarch have gone to take alive and some to us and some of that will be in sweeteners and starches and some may not. So I would rather get to close those operations before giving you. But you are correct, that should add to our segment sweeteners and starches on a global basis.","Robert Moskow","And it kind of builds to a broader question, Juan and Ray, that in your presentation today, you presented a lot of projects and I think it's kind of hard for us in the Street to quantify what the incremental benefit of those projects is. So, any more clarity you could give in future calls, because as you increase in invested capital base, the earnings power should go up, too. So just a comment.","Juan Luciano","Yes, that's correct. And that is the intention and, at this point in time, we were trying to balance both obviously. The improving earnings per share with the improving ROIC and that's why Ray was describing EVA is that's what we're looking at. But that's the intention. They are all investments to improve EPS and you should see that reflected in the bottom line as we go forward.","Ray Young","I think it's fair to say for major transaction, we're going to be very open with you, just like the WILD transaction. We were very open with you in terms of returns and accretion. I think you've raised a good point. We got a lot of smaller bolt-on acquisitions which, traditionally, on this bolt-on acquisitions or small acquisitions, we never really have given that much guidance on, but the pace of this is probably increasing. So you raise a good point. We may elect to actually fund them all up together and give you some direction so it'll help you in terms of your modeling.","Operator","There are no further questions. I turn the call back over to Juan Luciano for closing remarks.","Juan Luciano","Thank you all for joining us today. Slide 15 notes our upcoming investor events where we'll see each other. As always, please feel free to follow up with Mark, if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mark Schweitzer, Vice President, Investor Relations, for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. Schweitzer, you may begin.","Mark Schweitzer - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's second quarter earnings conference call. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's call will be available at adm.com.","For those following this presentation, please turn to slide two, the company's Safe Harbor Statement, which says that some of our comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results.","These statements are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risk and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC, concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. And you should carefully review the assumptions and factors in our SEC reports. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.","On today's call, our Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will provide an overview of the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results. Then, Juan will review the drivers of our performance in the quarter, provide an update on our scorecard, and discuss our forward look. Finally, they will take your questions.","Please turn to slide three. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million. Adjusted ROIC of 9% was 240 basis points above our cost of capital.","Our second quarter results demonstrate the strength and value of our geographic and business portfolio diversity. In Corn, domestic and export demand for ethanol was robust, but record industry production limited margins. This was partially offset by strong results from our corn sweeteners and starches business.","In Oilseeds, good meal demand supported strong North American soybean crushing results. And South American origination and export volumes were up, leading to good throughput at our expanded origination and port network. These, combined with the flexibility of our global crush plants, helped the Oilseeds team deliver another strong performance.","The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients team had an excellent quarter and continues to make great progress toward achieving their targeted cost and revenue synergies.","Ag Services earnings were impacted by lower margins and volumes of North American exports, as they were less competitive globally, and by a sharp upward move in commodity prices at the end of the quarter. But within our Ag Services segment, the milling business had record second quarter results","We've continued to advance our strategic plan that's improving our ROIC and growing our EVA. Among numerous other actions, we closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill; we closed the Barcarena port transaction with Glencore in June; and we remain on track to close both our Eaststarch transaction and the sale of our global cocoa business later this year.","And we're making great progress on our operational excellence initiatives. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard activities later in the call.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Juan. Slide four provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down from the strong $0.79 last year. Excluding specified items, and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27% compared to 28% in the second quarter of the prior year.","Our trailing four-quarter average ROIC of 9% significantly improved by 120 basis points from the 7.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. The 9% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015, as well as our long-term WACC of 8% as reflected in the graph on slide nine in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.","In the second quarter, our trailing four-quarter average EVA was $610 million based upon adjusted earnings and annual WACC, up $238 million from the second quarter of 2014.","On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share. For this quarter, LIFO represented $0.06 per share after-tax charge. We had some gains on sales or revaluations of assets, primarily related to our Northeast Brazil port and the Romanian port, totaling $0.11 per share. We also had some impairment charges, totaling $0.04 per share.","Slide five provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. We had some gains and some charges in Ag Services, Corn and Oilseeds segments that I mentioned in the last chart and are highlighted in our press release.","As a reminder, our cocoa and chocolate business remain part of our segment reporting results in Oilseeds until we have closed on the sales, and they're not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements.","Our new fourth business segment, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, is reported as its own segment for the second time this quarter. This segment includes the two businesses we acquired in 2014, Wild Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc, as well as certain specialty ingredients businesses that were previously reported in ADM's three other segments.","For purposes of comparison to prior results, the year-ago quarter's segment operating profit for Ag Services, Corn and Oilseeds removed the earnings of the businesses that are now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist you with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recasts 2014 segment quarterly results to the new segments.","In the corporate line, net interest expense was about flat. Unallocated corporate expenses were $19 million higher due to: one, increased GAAP pension expenses relating to the changes in discount rates and mortality tables; second, increased spending in IT in our ERP project; third, investments related to strategic business improvement projects; and lastly, unique costs related to specific divestiture activities, including the chocolate and cocoa.","We're starting to see some of the benefits of some of the strategic business improvement projects in our results. Excluding these factors, our run rate in underlying corporate costs are consistent with the prior year, and you should expect our run rate the next few quarters to be between $110 million to $120 million per quarter.","I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $17.2 billion, down from last year's $21.5 billion. This significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues, but this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key is managing the spread between the revenues and cost of goods sold, which is a core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing us.","I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements in the prior year do not include the revenues and the costs of WILD and SCI, which transactions closed in the fourth quarter of last year.","Now turning to the cash flow statement on slide six. Here's the cash flow statement for the six months ending June 30, 2015 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $1.2 billion from operations before working capital changes in the six months, slightly higher than the prior year. Total capital spending for the six months was $540 million, up from the prior year, but consistent with our guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the calendar year.","During the six months, we spent $1.2 billion to repurchase about 24 million shares towards our 2015 target of repurchasing $1.5 billion to $2 billion of shares, subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count for the first six months was 633 million diluted shares outstanding, down 28 million from the 661 million at this time one year ago. At the end of the second quarter, we had 621 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. For the first half, our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was over $1.5 billion.","Our six months cash flows are consistent with our 2015 calendar year targets of capital allocations, namely CapEx of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, approximately $700 million of dividends, and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. We have been more aggressive in the pace of stock buybacks, taking advantage of the recent weakness in our stock price, and all this is consistent with the balanced capital allocation framework we set forth at our December Investor Day.","Slide seven highlights our balance sheet as of June 30 for 2015 and 2014. Our balance sheet remains strong. Operating working capital of $8.3 billion was down $2.7 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $2.1 billion related to lower inventory prices, including the translation impact, partially offset about $0.9 billion related to higher inventory quantities and a decrease of about $1.5 billion in other working capital, primarily related to reclassification of working capital for our global cocoa and chocolate businesses under held-for-sale accounting.","Total debt was about $6.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $5.7 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $3.6 billion, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash outflows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI.","In addition, we raised \u20ac1.1 billion in June in the euro debt markets to take advantage of low interest rates and to serve as a net investment hedge for our grown euro asset base following the WILD acquisition. We have paid down $0.8 billion of notional debt in July in a U.S. debt tender settlement, and we may pay down an additional $0.2 billion before the end of the third quarter. While we will take a pre-tax charge of slightly above $0.2 billion in the third quarter related to the debt tender premium, we expect going forward our ongoing annual interest expense to be lower by about $40 million pre-tax, or $0.04 per share after-tax, through the combination of the U.S. debt reductions and the euro debt issuances. This U.S. debt tender\/euro debt issuance transaction had a very positive NPV benefit for ADM.","Our shareholders' equity of $18.6 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year, with the cumulative translation account down about $0.5 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.9 billion available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ray. Please turn to slide eight. In the second quarter, we earned $724 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. Our ROIC of 9% was up 120 basis points over last year's second quarter and EVA was up $238 million, an increase of more than 60% from last year.","First half operating profits were similar to the same period last year, despite a decline of more than $200 million in operating profits from the ethanol business. These results demonstrate the power of our business model.","Now, I will review the performance of each segment. Starting on slide nine, in the second quarter, Ag Services results declined from last year. Merchandising and handling results reflected a more significant seasonal decline in North American export volumes and margins, while some global demand was met by increased South American exports that improved our Oilseeds segment results.","We also saw lower Global Trade Desk margins, as the June 30 USDA report drove an increasing prices of some commodities, which negatively impacted some merchandising positions. While we had this impact at the end of Q2, markets came back a few days after the report.","In transportation, we saw lower total U.S. barge freight volumes and high water increased our costs. Milling and other results increased due to improvements in product margins, mix and strong merchandising results, a great quarter for our global milling operations; record second quarter results there.","Please turn to slide 10. Corn Processing results improved sequentially and declined year-over-year. In sweeteners and starches, overall volumes were up about 3% year-over-year. The tight supply chain for North American sweeteners supported very good margins and volumes. We also saw good demand for livestock feed. And our Almex joint venture in Mexico and our Eaststarch joint venture in Europe both delivered solid results.","And in bioproducts, ethanol earnings were lower. As I mentioned earlier, demand was robust, with increased exports and record U.S. driving miles, but margins were limited as the industry ran at record volumes. Our ethanol profitability improved from the first quarter, with second quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon.","Now, looking forward, on the demand side, we see continued strong domestic and export demand for ethanol. Driving miles are up more than 3%, which will help domestic ethanol consumption approach 14 billion gallons in 2015. We see annualized net exports running at about 800 million gallons. We expect continued growth of exports to markets that currently use MTBE. And E15 adoption continues to grow, which will also bolster demand long-term.","On the supply side, industry production levels will be a function of many factors, including maintenance timing, yields, hot weather, planned and unplanned downtime, and the pace of industry capacity creep.","In terms of what we are doing, we're strengthening our efforts to expand E15 adoption in the U.S. and ethanol adoption in markets abroad. We're also investing to further improve ADM's cost position in this business. ADM has invested a lot of effort to drive operational excellence and cost reductions in our wet mills, which represent about 1.1 billion gallons of nameplate capacity, and that have translated into strong financial results from these facilities even in challenging environments. We believe there are still opportunities to improve the cost positions of our large dry mills, which represent about 600 million gallons of nameplate capacity. We are intensifying efforts across a range of areas to drive these cost improvements.","In summary, we continue to believe there is an important place for ethanol in the global fuel supply, and we expect that our actions will help drive improved results from this business in the near term.","Slide 11 please. Oilseeds had another consistent solid quarter, similar to last year. In crushing and origination, large global bean supplies and strong U.S. mill demand drove great global soy crush results.","In the first half of 2015, we crushed record volumes of soybeans globally. As part of our strategic plan for Oilseeds, we've added switch capacity to more of our North American crush plants, and we profited from our global switch capacity in a weak softseed margin environment this quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, our South American origination and port operations, including our Barcarena port, had good throughput as the region's large corn and soy harvests proved the world's most competitive supplier. In fact, ADM's South American export volumes were up 38% compared to last year's second quarter. On the softseed side, concerns about seed supply significantly reduced margins and volumes.","Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results declined mainly on the absence of biodiesel blender's credits we recorded last year. In Europe and South America, margins were challenged by regional market conditions. In North America, we saw strong refining margins and our Stratas Foods bottled oil joint venture delivered its best quarter yet. Stratas continues to be an industry leader in working with customers to manage the transition away from trans fat. Results from Asia rose primarily and (20:19) improve performance.","Slide 12, please. In their second reporting quarter, the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit delivered more than $100 million in earnings, an excellent performance. Wild Flavors had strong results in North America. To provide some context, it's worth noting that in 2014, North America represented slightly more than half of the profit for Wild Flavors globally. And despite macroeconomic headwinds, Flavor profits in Europe were in line with our plan. And this quarter was one of the best ever for our specialty proteins business. Among other highlights, a customer launched the first retail product with our Textura customized inclusions.","The WFSI business with products ranging from protein, specialties to ancient grains to natural flavors, is a key component in ADM's efforts to serve customers with on-trend products to grow their business. As I mentioned earlier, WFSI team continued working across all ADM businesses to fuel synergy efforts.","In terms of revenue synergies, they continued to grow the pipeline and customer base. In the quarter, they added 175 projects to the pipeline, bringing the total to nearly 600 projects. In the quarter, they worked across all ADM's business units to deliver more than 50 more revenue synergy wins.","One interesting note here, the SCI team and their customer relationships have proved to be a valuable engine for driving cross business collaboration and delivering these wins. So, so far this year, the WFSI team has implemented $24 million in annualized run rate cost synergies, that's more than half away toward the three-year target.","We remain confident that the team will deliver \u20ac100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of year three, which is 2017. I would still expect the WILD business to deliver $0.10 to $0.15 earnings accretion in the first full year of operations, despite some forex headwinds.","Now, on the Slide 13, I would like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is a scorecard we presented at the Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few.","In Ag Services, we expanded our former services offering with an investment in AgriGold, a leader in on-farm analytical and forecasting tools. We announced the expansion of our port at Puerto General San Martin in Argentina, enhancing our export capability from the region. And our port services JV acquired a Brazilian port and shipping agency.","In Corn, we are on track to close the Eaststarch acquisition in the second half of the year. We contributed our liquids feed business into a joint venture to achieve greater scale without additional capital intensity. And in May, we announced an agreement to acquire a small sweetener manufacturer in Central China, but unfortunately that transaction failed through.","In Oilseeds, we closed the sale of a 50% stake in our Barcarena Port to Glencore. We closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill, and we remain on track to close the global cocoa sale to Olam by the end of the year.","And in WFSI, we acquired a Tree Nut & Seed Processing Facility in California, adding processing to support strong sales growth. We remain on track to deliver synergy and accretion targets, and we continue to advance our construction projects in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S.","And with respect to our operational excellence initiatives, I've talked about our objective of delivering $550 million of run rate savings by the end of year five. By the end of the second quarter, we have realized already about $125 million of these run rate savings. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter, and over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.","So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We continue to feel good about 2015. Large U.S. harvest should help drive utilization of our storage and transportation assets in the U.S. The large global corn corps, the tight North American sweetener balance sheet and continued global sweetener demand should support margins and volumes in our sweeteners and starches business.","As I mentioned earlier, in ethanol in the near-term and medium-term, we expect demand, both domestic and export to remain very strong. Production levels should also be robust and industry margin should evolve based on the supply-demand balance as we move through the year. We're intensifying our work on the cost position of our dry mills. Over the medium-term, ethanol remains the cheapest octane enhancer in the world and we're growing to work domestic and international demand.","Good global demand for meals should continue to support capacity utilization at our global soybean processing assets. And the WFSI team is well on track toward their costs and revenue synergy targets for 2015. We continue to see great collaboration across all of ADM's business units as we partner to serve a growing customer base.","Overall, we continue to advance our clear and aggressive strategic plan. We'll continue to see contributions from that effort throughout the year and will remain focused on growing EVA.","With that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Farha.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Could you just walk us around the globe for global crush margins, one? Clearly, soy crush margins are very, very strong. How will ADM position itself for that and can that be adequate to offset the weakness in softseed margins?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, margins in North America continued to be very, very good; very strong domestic demand. And if you remember, we announced earlier in the year that there are two facilities in the U.S., where we have added switch capacity to soybean. So, that's helping us to offset a little bit the weakness that we expect in softseeds.","South American margins continued to be solid. European margins were very solid in soybeans in second quarter. We took advantage again of our swing capacity and we maxed the soybean crushing capacity in Europe. We've seen now a little bit more softness as more South American soybean mill is arriving. And in China, we saw some recovery of that. It's not where it used to be at the beginning of the year, but it's much better than last year. So, overall, we see a strong continued demand and we foresee good crushing margins for the rest of the year.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And are you concerned about Argentine capacity coming back online this year or early part of next year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, I think that at one point in time we'll have to deal with that; it's predicated in many factors at this point what the farmer will do in Argentina. There are upcoming elections and all that. But we are fairly bullish given the domestic demand in the U.S. and the global demand that continues to grow for soybean mill.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful, thank you. And just one follow up. On Ag Services, in your prepared remarks you'd highlighted that you expect a strong performance in the second half from that business due to a good U.S. crop. Could you just share with us kind of what you've seen so far from the farmers as they've prepared for harvest, and kind of what you think your elevator utilizations are going to be and how that's going to affect earnings going forward?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So obviously, Ag Services' first half was softer than what normally is the second half. We saw it last year. It doesn't surprise us that much. If you look at the performance year-to-date for Ag Services, it's in line with the first quarter last year. So as last year, as the U.S. comes into the harvest and it becomes more competitive in export, we plan to move a very strong harvest through all our facilities. So we expect a very strong second half. We expect the U.S. to become more competitive in export; we haven't been so far. But we expect that that demand to come to our elevators very fast and being able to increase elevation margins towards the end of the year. So, at this point, we are very bullish second half for Ag Services earnings.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Adam.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Maybe the first question in ethanol, and Juan, I heard you express some confidence that the margin outlook would improve from here, and I guess I'm trying to reconcile. The supply\/demand with exports where they are seems reasonably balanced, although it's not clear stocks are actually going to draw as you move into the second half. But with the sharp decline in oil prices, how do you see \u2013 do you become incrementally concerned about the pricing of ethanol relative to gasoline, both domestically and overseas just keeping that margin kind of contained over the near term to medium term?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, we have to separate the analysis in certain businesses. From a demand perspective, we continue to feel very good about ethanol. As I said before, domestic demand with low gasoline prices got increased 3% and that pattern should continue with the normal seasonality between summer and winter in the U.S.","Export demand continues to be very solid in those countries that are already customers and we have many, many new countries trying to become new customers, and our team are out there trying to develop those markets. So, the issue always become the \u2013 in this relatively new industry, what's happened with the supply. And the supply has been strong so far during this year because we have a really mild start of the summer from a temperature perceptive. We expect that \u2013 right now, we've seen that even in June in July. Over the last three weeks, inventory has been flat or slightly declining for the last two weeks or three weeks. So, the industry can produce at that 15 billion gallon but not more than for a very few weeks.","And then, I would say, it's relatively balanced what do we see right now in ethanol. And even at this oil prices, we are making money in our \u2013 in all our mills. And if you think about the oxygenate values, MTBE continues to be at about $2.85 versus ethanol of about $1.50 or $1.60 and the other alkylates at about $2.50. So we continue to be the most competitive octane enhancer out there. And so without even thinking about E15 growing in the background. So I think overall \u2013 I cannot call it through the months or through the quarter because, as I said, this is a relatively volatile industry as we grow into our capacity. But I think, medium term, we're pretty optimistic about the balance turning to the favor of ethanol.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. that's very helpful. And then on \u2013 you expressed confidence in Ag Services in the second half principally in the U.S. Do you a) Was there a loss on the Global Trading Desk late in the quarter that provides some good cushion to the third quarter, and if so, can you quantify it? And second, how do you think about the mix, the breakdown of that Ag Services second half between the export volumes against a very competitive in South American crop versus domestic merchandising and origination, domestic transportation and the offshore business?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a complex question, Adam. Let me see if I can split it a little bit. So, the first part was \u2013 Global Trade Desk, yes, the loss on the Global Trade Desk, yeah.","As you know, June 30 report created a big volatility and basically brought prices up. So, when we mark-to-market that I think the loss was around $25 million, Adam. So maybe not that significant and the prices corrected like by July 2 or July 3, they go back to. So part of that has already come back in those positions.","Regarding second half, I think, maybe the export season will start a little bit later this year for the U.S. as South America continued to extend their window a little bit. But we believe that the demand will come to the U.S. and will come all of a sudden, altogether, so that will bode well for elevation margins. We think that our transportation business also will be very strong. We need to move a very large crop.","I think that we're going to see the comeback of the normal carries that we see in the U.S. So we believe that a very strong crop and a very big carryout bodes very well for our footprint in North America. So, I think it's going to be heavy fourth quarter loaded, and I cannot call it, Adam, whether it's all exactly fourth quarter or slip a little bit into Q1, but we are prepared to manage a very large crop.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then a point of clarification there on the carries. Is that corn or corn and wheat or both?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we're seeing both at this point in time.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's very helpful. I'll pass it along. Thanks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Your line is open.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, Juan. This is Cornell Burnette on with a few for David Driscoll.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Cornell.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. All right. Just wanted to give a few on ethanol. Just wanted to see what was your take on where export rents would be at the end of 2015. It appears to us that the number could be something greater than 1 billion gallons. And so putting that together with the fact that you're seeing somewhat of an oversupply currently in the ethanol market, just was wondering kind of what prevents margins from continuing to be soft if that is indeed the case?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We expect this balance to be like $1.8 billion. I think I said it before when I answered to Adam in the ethanol. It's difficult to call it in the short term. In the short term, there are risks to our forecast. Certainly, Brazilian ethanol could be coming into the U.S., but we continue to see market being developed outside the U.S. and the U.S. domestic market being robust. Consider these and I think we said it before, Cornell, there are out there at least 6 billion gallons of MTBE capacity that we're working very hard to replace and this product, again, ethanol is the most sustainable and the lowest cost octane enhancer. So I like to be in a positioned in a product that is very sustainable and lower cost and their alternatives. So there is a big market out there. And here we're going to go through ups and downs through all these regulations.","Again, I said it before, it's relatively new industry, an industry that has started in 2007. You need to go through phases of consolidation. We're going to have credit capacity, some producers will become better producer, more cost efficient that will push some of the marginal producers into more troubled water. That will to a certain degree modify the industry. So we're watching this industry development. But at this point in time, we continue to be very excited about the potential we find in our own plants to improve our competitive advantage, and the potential for this market to grow in front of us.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just a follow-up, I mean, over the remainder of 2015, we're looking at, on the futures market, petroleum price is under $50 a barrel and there is some concern that there might be some oversupply into the market. When you talk about kind of the ethanol profitability perhaps strengthening going forward from what you saw in the second quarter, was that predicated on us seeing some type of rebound in petroleum and that kind of what levels of petroleum do you think you can get there?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. At this point in time, I'd refrain from forecasting oil for obvious reasons. But I would say, in the current environment, when I make this comment, adding the framework of the current oil prices and the current corn prices, if you will. So I'm not forecasting that they're going to go anywhere.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Cornell.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, Juan and Ray. Just in general, it looks like the first half came in below internal expectations for the year. And judging from what you're saying that the mark-to-market trading benefit would only be $25 million in third quarter, it just looks like the year as a whole is going to be below what your internal expectations might have been. And I just kind of want to get a sense of that from you. Is there still a chance that you can hit your internal targets for the year as you set them?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me walk you through the different businesses, Rob. Oilseeds is way ahead of last year, and we continue to see upside in Oilseeds, granted we come in against the strong comps that we had in Q3 and Q4 last year, but Oilseeds is coming very strong on very strong demand. So that's ahead of last year and that should continue to be over the year.","Ag Services, as I told you, is on line for the first half. And last year, we had a second half that allowed us to deliver in the range of $850 million to $900 million. And we see, this year, again the possibility to be in that range, if we can repeat the second quarter, the second half. And with these kind of crops, we have the potential to do so. So I will say those businesses are on par or ahead of last year.","WFSI is having very good performance, will hit within the range. And so that an addition of last year. And then we have in sweeteners and starches that are going very, very strongly, and it needs to offset the weakness in ethanol. I think ethanol obviously started the year very soft in Q1, it improved in Q2, it has improved a little bit over the last three weeks.","So I think the issue is we have one business that we think it will deliver, which is Ag Services. We have two businesses, WFSI and Oilseeds, that will probably outperform, and that needs to offset a little bit the softness in ethanol. So all in all, at this point, we still feel good about 2015.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Also, from a returns perspective, Rob, we feel good about our ROIC focus, and we continue to be running our plants pretty aggressively and managing invested capital. We're buying back shares, also to reduce invested capital. So we feel good in terms of our progress towards ROIC as well.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Don't forget, Rob, that when we divest cocoa and chocolate, when you consider we are 9% ROIC today, we are divesting basically $1.2 billion of invested capital that, for us, represent very, very low returns. So our implicit return, when all that is gone, is going to get a boost.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, I totally agree, no doubt. I just think that your stock, whether justified or not, is going to hinge on forward projections for EPS and it just looks like the ethanol business, it would require a pretty heroic recovery to improve off of the first half. So I just think that that's what's holding back your stock.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah...","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And let me ask a follow-up. On share repurchase, Ray, did you say that you're shooting more towards the $2 billion now, in that range of share repurchase guidance? Is that what you said?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, given the pace that you've seen in the first half of the year, we've been fairly aggressive, especially when our stock pulled back. So I have to say that we're probably on the higher end of the range there, for sure.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And our balance sheet remains strong. So we've got a lot of capacity to buy back shares.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Certainly. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the Wild Flavors\/Specialty Ingredients segment and maybe you could talk about the cadence of earnings for the back half and what type of growth rate we might be looking for from an EBIT standpoint or a revenue standpoint as we look ahead maybe to some of the outer years?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, sure. So there is some seasonality in this business, as you know, because there is a lot of juices and there is a lot of product that are sold in the summer. So the second quarter is a slightly higher from a seasonal perspective than Q3, if you will.","Margins continue to be very strong in the high-teens EBITDA margins for this business. The ingredients growth that we continue to see are in the range of 3% to 5%, and when you take natural products, natural flavors products are more in the 5% to 6% range.","We feel very excited about the reaction that our customers have had to our product mix into these segments, and we've been expanding the customer base to make our business even much more robust. Just to give you some example, the number of customers driving 80% of sales have increased by 47%, which show the robustness of our pipeline going forward. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the pipeline of new wins or projects that compose our revenue synergy portfolio have had a quantum leap of 75% from Q1 to Q2. So all the prospects, all the products are on trends. Those trends are strong and customers are reacting very well to innovating with us. So we feel very good about it.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. So I mean, I guess just as a follow-up, I mean do you have any quantification? And I understand the seasonality part, but in terms of like do you have a revenue target or, in terms of next year, what could that $0.10 to $0.15 maybe turn into from an accretion standpoint? Thanks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. To be honest, Michael, this is such a new business for us and this is a combination for us of nine different businesses that we grouped together. So we don't have a strong comp, so we don't have a lot of history to \u2013 and since a lot of this growth are the product of combination of new synergies, of new solutions for customer, it is difficult to put a target. We know we are ahead of schedule in terms of synergies and we know we're going to deliver the accretion next year; we just haven't developed the robustness of comps going forward since this is a new business for us.","Mark Schweitzer - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, do we have more questions or...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Ann.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. My question is more kind of big picture. There was some press releases over the weekend that the Chinese government is considering changing its corn pricing policy and that if it did do so, the world might be awash in Chinese corn. Just curious if you've heard anything about that and what could that do to your business if they did indeed change their pricing policy?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. There are two things, Ann, that everybody says bring excitement to our lives in the grain business; one is weather, the other is government intervention. So we are very used to follow that, to track that. It always presents opportunity for discontinuity. Obviously, we hear the rumors that China is finding more difficult to sustain these subsidies to the farmers, but we don't know at this point in time. And I'd rarely bet against the Chinese government; they seem to be very prudent and very strategic about their moves. So we're just paying attention. Obviously, a release of inventories or a drop in price could mean a decline in prices for corn. That would probably bode well for our business.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I appreciate that. And not to beat a dead horse on the ethanol side, but you were very clear at the end of Q1 that you're running the ethanol business for profits, not for volumes. The tone of your comment seems to have changed a little bit. Am I reading too much into that or are you just running for volume now, not returns?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't make a statement for the full quarter, so we don't commit to the position. It's very much tactical based on what we see in the supply and demands and what we see in the unplanned capacities and the weather and all that. So the team remains very flexible. I guess what we wanted to say is we're trying to maximize earnings into our business. It depends, during the quarter we may move from one position to the other. So I wouldn't make a statement for the full quarter at this point.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll get back in line and take my questions offline. Thanks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ann.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Ken.","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Ken.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I had just two questions. One is on the Ag Services, what are the keys that we have to be looking for, for you to have the recovery? Is it the basis, is it the farmer moving and what are the concerns that are associated with when the farmer is going to be selling and how do you think about it?","And then my second question is, can you give us an update on the cost savings programs? Are you finding more \u2013 is it coming in as expected and just give us an update on that as well? Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So one key thing in Ag Services is the rate of exports and how competitive the U.S. is. Obviously, the U.S. have shown some competitiveness out of the PNW this year, but still the Gulf continues to be second or third in terms of bids versus other origin. So that will be probably the key aspect that will drive our earnings in the second half. But every year, the Ag Services business find different ways to make money. Sometimes it's through better usage of our footprint, sometimes different carriers, sometimes it's through export. So we will adjust; a large crop gives us a lot of opportunities. The second point was?","Ray G. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Cost savings.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the cost savings program, yeah. We are, at this point in time, a $125 million run rate of that promise of $500 million in five years. I will say, Ken, that we have probably identified enough opportunities that we know already that we can implement, that are close to $380 million to $400 million of those $500 million. And since we are one year into this five-year program, we feel that we are ahead of schedule.","So we continue to find \u2013 you heard me saying about our intensifying focus on dry mills. The wet mills are larger and older. So rightfully so, when we started this program, we focused a little bit more energy there because we felt the opportunity was bigger. Now, when we look at the difference we have in cost between the wet mills and the dry mills, we feel that there are opportunities there, whether it's enzymes or yields or things like that. So we continue to find ADM is a large company, and as much as we cut cost, we continue to find new technologies that bring us new promises.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Returning to ethanol, you highlighted E15 as a positive driver, and I know the near-term is hard to forecast. But I think flex-fuel vehicles currently about 6% to 7% of the total vehicle fleet. I was wondering where you see this going over the long term and how quickly do you see us getting there?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. When we started with E15, we said that we were expecting the implementation to take about five years. And I think, at the end of the day, we would like to thank Secretary Vilsack for making available some funds to invest in infrastructure. The industry has coalesced around that and is gathering money and is putting together projects to be able to participate in this program. And at the end of day, there's going to become a tipping point, and I don't know exactly when to call it, but we think that by 2017, 2018, this will become a more meaningful part of our fuel supply, and we feel very good what that will do to supply-demand balances for the ethanol industry.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, thank you. And then just to shift to biodiesel, could you tell us how you're thinking about the near-term to medium-term outlook? And do you see further opportunities to reduce your dependency on biofuels in Europe, or have you already done what you needed to do on that front?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I will say, first of all, in the medium term, situation is tough for biodiesel. In the absences of a more clear RFS, biodiesel will struggle, no doubt. I will say in our strategic intent to reduce the dependency on biodiesel, we are just getting started. You heard us about AOR, which is an acquisition we did in Belgium on a bottle oil producer. So there are three elements to our program. One is to crush more soy in Europe that produces less oil. The second is to grow our share in food industry, which AOR is one of those elements. And the third one is to increase the use of oil into industrial uses, and that's growing as well. But I will say you're not going to feel an impact until probably 2016 from our perspective.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. That's helpful.

This morning, we reported fourth quarter net earnings of $284 million or $0.43 per share on a diluted basis. Our adjusted EPS was $0.38 per share. Our segment operating profit was $544 million. For the full fiscal year, net earnings were $1.2 billion or $1.84 per share, adjusted EPS was $2.25 per share and segment operating profit for the year was $2.5 billion.","In a challenging fourth quarter, we saw solid results from our global oilseeds business, particularly in South America. They were more than offset by negative U.S. ethanol margins and weaker U.S. merchandising results. During the 2012 fiscal year, we have worked to optimize profits in this environment and we have also implemented actions that will improve ADM's earnings power and returns. We restructured our organization to improve productivity. Through that and other cost actions, we expect to reach more than $150 million in annual run rate savings by March of 2013. This year, we invested $1.5 billion in capital -- $1.5 billion in capital spending and $200 million in acquisitions with the focus on our growth CapEx on investments outside the U.S. For the second half of the calendar year 2012, July through December, we are planning about $500 million to $600 million of capital spending. Later this morning in his remarks, Juan will discuss our plans to buy a port and upgrade it in Northern Brazil.","During the 2012 fiscal year, we managed our portfolio very carefully, shuttering operations in oilseeds, corn and milling that were not part of our objectives for profits or returns. And we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","As we look ahead, while the drought in the U.S. has reduced the potential size of the U.S. corn crop, we are tracking the development of other crops in North America and in Europe. While U.S. crop carryouts are expected to be low, we have an exceptional and experienced business team to manage through this environment. Conditions like these demonstrate the vital role of our global agribusiness. As weather has regional effects on crops, we respond by working with our customers to provide the best alternatives to meet their needs from all growing regions of the world.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides some financial highlights for the quarter, which I'll run through briefly. As Pat noted, quarterly segment operating profit was $544 million, down from last year's $921 million. Quarterly net earnings were $284 million, down 25% from last year's fourth quarter. Looking at our effective income tax rate for the quarter, we recorded taxes at 30%, resulting in an annual rate of 30% for the fiscal year. Our earnings per share were $0.43 on a fully diluted basis compared to last year's $0.58. Our adjusted earnings were $0.38 per share compared to last year's $0.69 per share. For the full fiscal year 2012 our adjusted earnings were $2.25 per share, down from the $3.45 level in fiscal year 2011. On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted earnings for the fourth quarters of fiscal year '12 and fiscal year '11, as well as for both fiscal years.","In our LIFO adjusted 4-quarter trailing return on invested capital of 5.3% was 50 basis points below our WACC of 5.8%. Excluding other specified items such as our PHA charge in the second quarter and the global workforce restructuring charge in the third quarter, our adjusted ROIC of 6.2% was above our WACC by 40 basis points. Details of our ROIC and WACC performance can be found in Chart 19 of the appendix.","Slide 6 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Juan will talk about the business segment results in his update. I would like to remind you that we realigned our segment reporting in the fourth quarter, with cocoa included in the oilseeds segment and milling and Gruma included in the ag services segment. This is to reflect how we are now managing these businesses. You can see a line called cocoa and other in oilseeds, which includes the cocoa, peanut and cellulose businesses. And you can see a line in milling & other in ag services, which includes milling and Gruma and our Alliance Nutrition and our Edible Beans businesses. In addition, we have moved working capital interest out of the business segments and into the corporate line. Our restatement of historical quarterly segment information to the new reporting format is included in the appendix.","Now let me touch on a few items of significance in the corporate line. I mentioned LIFO earlier, a small credit of $50 million for the quarter similar to last year. Interest expense of $112 million for the quarter was similar to last year. Unallocated corporate expenses of $67 million are down significantly from last year due primarily to lower salary and benefit cost, in part from the global workforce reduction and lower general overhead expenses.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 7, we generated $2.6 billion from operations before working capital changes for the fiscal year. We had a $300 million improvement in working capital, in part from the $1 billion sale of receivables executed in the third quarter. Total capital spending and acquisitions in the fiscal year was comprised of about $1.5 billion in capital spending and about $200 million in acquisitions. This was consistent with the revised target we communicated earlier in the year. Despite a challenging year from an earnings perspective, we were able to generate cash to pay down some debt, return a significant amount of capital to shareholders, and also increase our cash balances. Our total debt decreased by about $100 million, and our cash balances increased by $676 million.","For the fiscal year, we returned about $1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Of the 44 million shares issued in June 2011 related to the equity unit conversion, we have bought back 30 million shares. Our intent is to mitigate the impact of the dilution by June 2013, although we will adjust the pace of the buybacks to reflect near-term working capital needs and near-term leverage. We finished out the year with shares outstanding of 659 million shares, and our average outstanding shares for the fiscal year 2012 was 666 million shares.","Slide 8 shows the highlights of our balance sheet. Fourth quarter cash on hand was approximately $1.5 billion, up from the $1.2 billion level in the third quarter. Our operating working capital was about $15 billion, similar to the third quarter of which $12 billion was inventories and $8 billion was readily marketable. Total debt was about $10 billion and shareholders equity was $18 billion, also similar to our third quarter levels. Our ratio of net debt to total capital, excluding cash from gross debt, is 33%, which is similar to the level at the end of fiscal year 2011. We had $1.3 billion outstanding in commercial paper and we had available credit capacity of $4.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. With our solid balance sheet, we are prepared to handle an environment of higher commodity prices. Even with the recent surge in commodity prices, we still have about $3 billion of available credit capacity globally.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review for the quarter.","Juan R. Luciano","Thanks, Ray. Good morning to everyone on the call. Beginning on Slide 9, I will take you through the highlights of each of our business segments, then I will provide our current assessment of market conditions and their implications for ADM.","Oilseeds operating profit in the fourth quarter was $331 million, down $118 million from the same period 1 year earlier. Crushing and origination operating profit was $150 million, down $76 million from the year ago quarter, which benefited from significant favorable timing effects in Europe. This year's quarter reflected about $70 million less in favorable timing effects. South American soybean crushing and grain origination results improved significantly. We had lower North American softseeds crushing results as supplies were tight. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $84 million for the quarter, down $6 million, mainly on weaker biodiesel results from Europe. Cocoa and other results declined $19 million mainly due to weaker cocoa press margins. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were down $17 million from the prior year's fourth quarter, principally reflecting our share of the results from equity investee, Wilmar.","Please turn to Slide 10. As you see, Corn Processing operating profit was $74 million, a decrease of $48 million from the same period 1 year earlier. Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $124 million to $135 million, amid continued sweetener export demand and higher average selling prices. Last year's fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by a higher net corn cost resulting from the timing of economic hedges, whose mark-to-market gains were recognized in earlier quarters in that fiscal year. Bioproducts results in the quarter decreased $172 million to a loss of $61 million. We saw improved results from the rest of our bioproducts businesses, but those gains were offset by significantly weaker ethanol results. Industry ethanol replacement margins were negative through the quarter as industry supply exceeded demand.","Turning to Slide 11, you will see a review of our Agricultural Services segment. Operating profit was $123 million, down $222 million from the same period 1 year earlier. Merchandising and handling earnings fell $152 million to $30 million due to lower U.S. merchandising results and lower U.S. crop supplies, which reduced North American export volumes. Results for the quarter also reflected an increase in loss provisions of about $40 million. Transportation results increased $5 million to $17 million. Excluding a $78 million gain related to ADM's share of a Gruma asset disposal that benefited last year's fourth quarter, milling and other results were steady.","On Slide 12, you can see highlights from other financials. In the fourth quarter, operating profit from these businesses was $16 million, up $11 million from the same period 1 year earlier. The improvement was primarily a result of lower captive insurance loss reserves and better results at ADM Investor Services.","On Slide 13, I would like to update you on our capital spending and M&A for fiscal year 2012. As Ray mentioned, we invested $1.5 billion in capital spending and $200 million in acquisitions, consistent with our revised target. Of our $1.2 billion in global growth spending, about half was spent outside of the United States. And we targeted the majority of this growth spending in the oilseeds and ag services divisions as part of our capital allocation strategy. Our largest investments in 2012 fiscal year included the acquisition of Elstar Oils in Poland, our construction of the Paraguay soybean crush plant which is on track to start operations by harvest, our purchase of a group of grain elevators in Wisconsin, our acquisition of storage facilities in Slovakia, and our purchase of barges for the Mississippi River to support export operations. Each of these larger investments supports either our strategy to expand our international origination and processing footprint or our strategies to strengthen our U.S. export infrastructure.","Looking forward to the second half of calendar year 2012, we plan to spend approximately $500 million to $600 million in capital spending over the 6-month period. The reduced rate of spending reflects a more cautious view of the global macroeconomic and commodities environments and likely increased needs for working capital. Our spending in this period will again be focused on strengthening our international footprint.","Later this morning, we will be announcing an agreement to purchase a port terminal in Northern Brazil. This investment is part of our overall strategy to increase our origination and transportation networks in the world's most productive regions. This port will increase our capacity to export grain from West and Northern Brazil and further expand our fertilizer operations throughout the country. We will be converting the facility from handling minerals to handling ag products, and we expect it to be up and running by early 2014. Our purchase is subject to regulatory approval.","Turning to Slide 14, we want to provide some perspective on current market conditions and their implications for ADM. Global protein meal demand remains solid, so we expect good U.S. industry capacity utilization. The smaller South American spring harvest means the U.S. is currently the world's main seller of meal. It has also improved soybean crush margins in Europe. Solid demand for corn sweeteners means industry sweetener capacity will remain tight and ethanol inventories are declining as production has dropped. U.S. corn and soybean yields have been reduced by drought. Wheat was less affected. U.S. corn exports will be lower. Export demand for U.S. soybeans should be good given the limited South American carryout. And wheat exports should be good. And as always, the cure for high prices is high prices. We expect that South American farmers will respond to high crops prices by increasing planted acres.","Now I turn the call back to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Juan. Before we take your questions, let me just recap. We had a challenging fourth quarter, solid oilseeds results, poor ethanol margins, lower ag services results. And in the full fiscal year, we had workforce reductions with upwards of $150 million in annual savings. Our growth CapEx is focused outside the U.S. We carefully managed our portfolio and we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders. Now Craig will join Juan, Ray and me for the Q&A. So Christina, would you -- Cristy, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Pat, can you talk about I guess the current ethanol environment? You said that inventory is declining. It sounds like the industry is reacting to high prices, but can you give us a sense of what current margins are and what the breakeven price is at $8 [ph]  Corn?","Patricia A. Woertz","Yes. I'm going to ask Juan to talk about the ethanol environment. If you want, I can talk about policy issues in Washington. So Juan?","Juan R. Luciano","Okay. Yes, Ryan. Currently, the industry has been adjusting production. We are -- if you take the peak at 14.7 billion gallons, we are about 2.5 billion gallons lower than that. So we're running at around 12 billion something. So we can see that rationalization that, that has started to reduce inventories and that has started to turn margins, if you will. Margins continue to be extremely volatile because as the industry is trying to reduce inventories, corn is moving at the same time. So that produces a lag. So we've seen, overall, if you will, an improvement in margins. They are still -- replacement margins are still negative, if you think about that.","Patricia A. Woertz","And I might just comment, as I said, on the Washington side, kind of 2 conversations are going on in Washington. One relates to ethanol continuing to be the lowest cost fuel in the world, strong job creation, strong important economics in the Midwest and yet, the drought discussions about who experiences the pain associated with higher prices and how that will continue to be rationed.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And so do you guys expect margins to remain negative until we harvest the U.S.?","Juan R. Luciano","Last year, Ryan, margins turned about June 15. Candidly, we were expecting that to happen about the same time for this year. I think that probably the industry has more coal ownership and maybe they've been running a little bit on that. Now for the summer, we expect with the high corn prices and also some of the chilling units not running as hard. We expect margins to turn within this quarter.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last quick one. In terms of the -- I know, the Agro National Insurance Company [ph] that you guys own, you guys do write insurance for farmers. But I guess can you give us an idea of the size of that business, what your exposure is and if you are potentially going to have losses, when would you have to recognize them?","Ray G. Young","We've -- Ryan, it's Ray Young here. We're still relatively small from a market share perspective in the United States in terms of crop insurance although we're growing. We have taken some provisions already in the fourth quarter related to this business -- related to the crop, but we're monitoring the situation here. So it's not going to be material for our business here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping for a little more detail on what ag services could do for fiscal '13. You say you're tracking other crops and you mentioned wheat and oilseeds, but is it fair to say that we should be expecting a below-average year? According to the prior definition, average was $150 million to $200 million a quarter. I was thinking along the lines of below that range. What do you think, Ray?","Juan R. Luciano","Robert, this is Juan. I can answer the question for you. We certainly have been impacted this quarter with lower volume, so you can see the results. As we look at -- into the future, we certainly are facing this prospect of reduced crops. So we have -- we are developing contingency plans for our business to make sure that we adjust our cost position. Certainly, we have contingency plans in terms of quality. We think that there is going to be big variances in quality that will present opportunities for us although the crops will be reduced by an X factor. That X factor is not evenly distributed around the country. And as we look at our -- the position of our assets and our transportation network, we think that, that will provide opportunity also to serve these locations. We do believe that our global footprint, especially in South America, has performed this quarter very, very well. We think that it will provide advantages going forward. You know Brazil has a spectacular safrinha of corn, and we're moving that. And I think that our international merchandising group has been improving the origination around the world and that will serve good for them, too. Also, as we come into this next quarter, we have -- in Q4, we suffered a little bit. Our export program in Argentina suffered from some logistic strikes, and that is being corrected. And we think that we're going to have a better execution in Q1.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Juan, I appreciate all the detail. Just can I follow up on corn? Your corn sweetener margins were pretty solid, and I know that you had a price increase that went into effect on your fixed contracts in January. Can you give us a sense of how your corn is positioned on those contracts? Can we expect that same cost basis that you had in the second quarter? Is that going to follow through in calendar third quarter and calendar fourth quarter?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, Robert. We are -- I think we said it before. We are mostly hedged in those contracts. So yes, as you see, we have a solid volume and we implemented the new price increases. And we expect that solid performance to continue throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just to follow-up on those 2 questions. The first one was, can you actually price through the recent higher spike in corn prices and sweeteners? And can you talk about the outlook on that in terms of the margin ability going into 2013?","Ray G. Young","Well, Ken, I mean, a couple of things. First of all, in terms of the sweeteners, I mean, for the fixed-price contracts, those are locked in. And as we indicated, we generally hedge those contracts. So that's why Juan made the comment that we feel pretty comfortable on that. I mean, there is always going to be some level of spot business available. And given the tightness that we have in terms of sweetener capacity in the United States, we generally feel that we'll be able to pass on price increases on spot businesses. Now looking at calendar year next year...","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm not talking for the contracting year coming up.","Ray G. Young","Yes. So for calendar year '13, as you know, we generally have contracts on a calendar year basis. We haven't started negotiating that yet. We'll get into the negotiation towards the end of the calendar year. And we'll look at the market at that point in time, and we'll negotiate with customers in terms of arriving at contract prices reflective of market conditions.","Juan R. Luciano","I will say, Ken, that our commercial team is getting very close to our customers these days, and I would say that conversations have started. Obviously, customers are worried about that. So we started discussions but not contract negotiations yet.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then with respect to the change in the U.S. crop outlook, is there anything that you guys need to do in terms of either capital allocation changes, changes in capacity levels or something that's reacting to this condition that you need to kind of reposition your -- again, either your allocation of capital or your capacity levels?","Juan R. Luciano","In terms of the allocation of capital, Ken, you saw in my prepared remarks that we have reduced the capital just to be prudent going forward given the maybe elevated working capital demands that these new prices will post on us. But second, we are -- we continue to increase our investment outside the U.S. to balance our global footprint. In terms of ag services per se, we are implementing a set of contingency plans just to make sure we match our cost position with maybe a reduced volume for the year. So several things are being put in place right now.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","In the situation where you reallocate for ag services, do you think you could still reach that lower level, the $150 million, or -- on an ongoing [ph] level -- or do we have to wait until the next crop year to actually replenish that $150 million to $200 million level?","Juan R. Luciano","I think at least I would like to know what kind of crop are we having in front of us. So I think it's a little bit too premature. It's a volume business as you know and we are still watching the weather. So I will probably -- I will wait until the final USDA report on crops.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to go over to soybean processing. So with the -- given where we are in the time line of growth for the U.S. soybean crop, I think we're getting pretty clear information that the U.S. soybean crop is also going to be significantly damaged because of the drought. I don't know that anybody knows exactly where the numbers are, but I think it's pretty sure that we're -- it's to safe to say that. So when I think about crushing margins on new crops, soy and then externally in other parts of the world, I'd just like to hear your comments on how your asset base will handle a very tight global oilseeds situation. And I'm thinking that this isn't really all that bad that yes, you'll have to pay up for the underlying crop, but just simply given the fact that these end customers have to have it, crushing margins in the environment really ought to be perhaps okay, maybe even better than if you had a tremendous crop in both North and South America and then we would have seen the effect of the overcapacity, which you've talked about at length on prior calls. So apologies for the long-winded question, but can you discuss these factors on Oilseeds Processing and what your outlook is for that business?","Juan R. Luciano","Sure. David, this is Juan. We've seen, as I mentioned before, very good results in South America. Demand for high pro has been very good. And also, Brazil has been able to cover for some of the shortages for all of Argentinian oil and also some needs in China. So business was very good over there. I would say the soybean crushing in the U.S. continues to be very strong this quarter. Actually, this past quarter was a little bit softer in softseeds but in soybeans has been very strong. Again, South America doesn't have a lot of meal to compete with. The same impact we have seen in Europe in which our soybean crushing in Europe, the margins there have improved significantly, too. But still, Europe continues to be a little bit soft in the oil side, but I think that even canola is getting a little bit of a boost from the meal demand. So I will -- we will say, all in all, our assets are faring very well into that. Maybe I'll pass it a little bit to Craig to comment also in some of the soybean conditions, too.","Craig E. Huss","I think the very positive thing about soybeans is that you replenish the supply twice a year when you -- so we have very tight demand now. That should be very good for our crop. We'll ration that through, but we know that in Feb, March, we'll have South America to come on. So it's a margin basis and it's a crushed volume basis. So soy is not nearly the concern, although we do have concerns about the crop. We need rain across the country, obviously, to finish this crop off.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So it sounds like you guys would agree with my assessment that the crushing margin environment in the next 12, 18 months is really actually pretty good because of the tightness out there. Is that -- I mean, bottom line, is that correct?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. We are optimistic about our businesses being solid performer and we expect it to continue in that way.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. One final question here, just following up on the ethanol margin comment. I think you actually said you expect margins in ethanol to go positive next quarter. Now I'd -- boy, I'd really like to probe this one a bit. Juan, were you talking about old crop corn, ethanol margins simply because people run out and you guys have corn? Are you talking about new crop corn? And if you're talking about new crop corn, I'm -- that seems to be remarkably optimistic given the pressures. I'd love to hear the kind of the details as to why those margins would go positive under such tremendous corn stress.","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. I said that we were expecting -- as of last year, we saw margins turn in June 15. We were expecting this time to take a little bit longer. We said that maybe we expected it to have happened and it hasn't today. So we continue to look with hope for that to happen in the future. We think that with more corn availability, with more heat making this plant produce a little bit less that maybe there is an opportunity there to supply it in line with demand and maybe we see improvement in margins.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's an old crop corn comment though and then -- I believe so. And then new crop corn, just given where prices look like they're headed and the fact that the damage, it looks to be like this is -- this could surpass the '88 drought. Would you agree that the futures curve is showing negative margins and that the environment for ethanol on the new crop looks to be pretty tough?","Juan R. Luciano","I think yes and no. The way I tend to think about it, David, is more of a supply and demand issue. And it's an issue of how many people can produce versus how many people can stay in the game for a relatively -- relatively maybe inelastic demand. So as I've said, we are 2 billion gallons per year down from the peak. And corrected for gasoline consumption, demand is pretty much flat, if you will, flattish or slightly down. So that is our hope or our view that if production continues to be lower because more people are having difficulty financing their working capital or running their plants, we expect those margins to tighten a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine McCracken of Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just in terms of your ethanol production, because in the past when we've seen drought stressed corn, we've seen a big increase in aflatoxin and then big knock-on effects in the distillers, are you at all concerned with the quality of the corn coming out this year? And if you could comment on how you're managing that.","Craig E. Huss","This is Craig. Yes, we're certainly concerned. You are always concerned when there is heat on a crop like this. We are making all kinds of plans, of alternatives that we can do all the way for back in 1988, the government allowed blending of aflatoxin. We'll have to wait to see where they go. And if there's aflatoxin, we'll direct that. And there are legal specifications of which animals can handle which degrees. And our transportation network, we're prepared, for example, to go to Texas with aflatoxin that -- with higher degrees and we'll certainly protect our plants on the front end. But it's all part of the planning process.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","And then is there any way -- do you expect to adjust or lower your ethanol volumes? If you can't get sufficient corn in certain areas -- how do you adjust for that? If you can't secure delivery -- I'm hearing a lot about farmers not delivering on contracts. I'm just curious how you manage that.","Craig E. Huss","I think that's always the case when prices run up. I think as an industry, we have less ownership this year than we have in the past, which helps that risk, but also 80-something-percent of the farmers are insured with the program. So I -- we see less of that in the past, but it won't be a concern. And we're checking contracts on a regular basis as you do any time a crop runs up like that. But this location -- yes, if there aren't, we'll manage the margin process in ethanol just like we do in any part of our business.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","And then just on your crushing side, with the losses that we're seeing on the livestock industry and on a relative basis, probably pretty sizable declines in overall feed demand here as we see some cutbacks -- how are you looking at kind of their ability to take on that kind of price increase especially on meal and what are the alternatives? I know that historically, distillers have been a good substitute there, maybe some amino acids? Can you talk about how that all fits into your outlook?","Craig E. Huss","Well, substitution will be a major concern for -- these are our customers. We live with these guys and we are working with everyone to provide the full stratus of all of our different divisions, whether it be the cotton group can pick it up or be the softseeds group. For example, we will see -- I think, we'll see canola meal move into soya rations, and it should help the bio group with the lysine, et cetera. But it's -- we have -- we all talk to these livestock people. And our concern, more than anything, is that we help these people preserve the herds and help this thing go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Pat, maybe we could draw on your pre-ADM experience to talk a little bit more about ethanol. Let's assume that -- or I guess, my question is, ethane, I understand -- as I understand it, is an important source of octane for the gasoline pool and I also understand it to be the least expensive source of octane in terms of getting from 84 to 87, which I think is the minimum to sell commercial gasoline. What would happen if, for some reason, ethanol wasn't available to the gasoline pool? And I guess my -- what I'm really saying is if you got rid of the RFS, would it actually make a difference?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, Vincent, your question has as its premise really, economics -- and blending economics are what's driving -- and more importantly, what's driving the ethanol business more so than the mandate or it's less dependent on the mandate. You're right that other alternative octane substitutes or blending components are more expensive today, whether it's alkylates or imported blending components are more expensive than ethanol. Ethanol is less than RBOB or a regular unleaded gasoline. And so the economics are there to blend. So hopefully, not only is it available because the industry can supply our customers as we're attempting to do, but it's the most economic for blenders and they look to it as the most important octane booster.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And do you think that's something that's well understood in sort of the policy debate around this?","Patricia A. Woertz","A lot about the policy debate has different arms and legs to it depending on the constituencies who are presenting their point of view. So no, I don't think it's completely understood by everyone, but all aspects of this sometimes are interrelated. So we try to communicate the issues as factually and economically as we can with all the components considered. I think the EPA is very informed and smart about things. And I think they will duly consider anything in this regard. So I don't think they are uninformed.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on your own ethanol operations, I mean, it clearly is a supply and demand issue and as we just discussed, the underlying octane value of ethanol compared to substitutes is much higher and if the supply and demand were tighter, there is actually a case where ethanol could trade above RBOB so long as it was cheaper than alkylate or aromatic or what have you. And so I guess the question is, is do you guys ever think about sort of acting as a swing producer in ethanol and maybe sort of being that lever that gets the industry from oversupply to undersupply because it would seem like perhaps the margin improvement on the gallons that you would sell might offset sort of the lost operating leverage? So could you maybe talk to that a little bit?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. Vincent, this is Juan. I would say we will consider that if we believe that we could make that impact. At this point in time, there are probably 28 plants down of a total of maybe 204 plants down. So it's still a very fragmented market. I think the market will evolve into a more consolidated market one day, where maybe we can have that kind of impact, like maybe these days in the soybean margin -- markets where, sometimes, we adjust capacity utilization and we see a result. I don't think the market is mature to -- for us to accomplish that goal by reducing our capacity. So at this point, we put all our efforts and continue to drive our cost position down and over through our whole value chain all the way from origination to transportation, and that's what our focus is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio of Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I guess based on your comments that you see ethanol margins turning within the quarter, is it fair to say that you're pretty comfortable with the carrying value of the long-term, long-lived ethanol assets?","Ray G. Young","Yes. This is Ray here. Yes, let me -- as you appreciate, we do analysis of impairments every quarter and we take a hard look at the end of fiscal year. But based upon our outlook, our long-term outlook in terms of where we think margins are and  [indiscernible] impairment analysis based on cash flow, not earnings here, we feel comfortable where we are right now.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question on consolidation. With some of the smaller players maybe struggling even more than ADM, do you see the opportunity to potentially, over the next 9 to 12 months, to act as a consolidator within the industry?","Juan R. Luciano","Tim, we're always looking. When it makes sense and it's a plan that actually we can plug into our system and doesn't detract our future position, I think we will consider.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport & Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Regarding potential acquisitions, is there any change in the number of opportunities out there?","Patricia A. Woertz","I'd say with the opportunities set may change going forward. Certainly, when you have distressed times or people are looking at such, there may be some opportunities going forward that currently are not in our queue, but we continue to look and have as we indicated even on our port this morning in Northern Brazil. We have our eye outside the U.S. and particularly in the growing regions and the areas that complement our system quite nicely.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","So the reduction and -- or the more cautious capital spending forecast reflects more kind of -- more cautious stance and potential higher working capital needs versus a change in the landscape of potential opportunities. Is that fair?","Ray G. Young","That's correct. Yes.","Patricia A. Woertz","That's correct.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, a number of protein companies are now talking about importing corn from South America. Are you participating in any of that business?","Craig E. Huss","We would. We have not at this point, but we certainly would. We are marketing corn out of Brazil and we just -- we have discussed that, in this case the market is the market. And if we can help the livestock producers with their margin structure, we'll help to do that. This is a rationing process and that's part of that rationing.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my other question, you talked about developing contingency plans in your ag services and one of them was matching cost and volume. Can you give us any other indication of what areas you may also make adjustments or what are the plans you're working on?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. We have a lot of -- sometimes we hire temporary workers for the harvest season and we can adjust that. We can adjust time in which some of our elevators will be receiving or be open. So we adjust our transportation thing. So we -- there is a battery of things. We have many, many assets and there are many levers that we can pull.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Horowitz of Topeka Capital Markets.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Juan, you mentioned high prices take care of high prices. I guess the concern is you're discussing the potential for margin improvement in ethanol due to capacity rationalizations. This capacity -- at least the last time we saw this from a margin standpoint, capacity shut-ins were very temporary and far more financial than any structural issue -- when margins returned so did all of that periphery capacity. Why would it be different this time? And why would we not see some of that subpar capacity come right back online when margins show any sign of improvement?","Juan R. Luciano","Ian, I think I tend to agree with you. When I said before this is a relatively new industry that needs to mature and consolidate, I think that we're still going to have some periods in which -- when market -- when margins improve, some of that capacity will come back up. So I think that's where we need to get to things like maybe E15 or other measures or exports to actually tighten that up with the full capacity. I was describing about reproducing the cycle maybe we had last year that maybe we had half of the year unprofitable and half of the year with good margins. So -- but I agree with you. Until there is more consolidation, you're always going to have some shutdowns and then when the margins come back, some of that capacity will come back up.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And from a policy standpoint or maybe not even a policy but just kind of an understanding of what's the conversation is going on inside the Beltway. If we see overall gasoline demand somewhere below that ability to absorb RFS2 on a 13.8 billion gallon level for 2013, with no regard to high corn prices or negative livestock margins or anything, what is in place to handle that obligation, where blenders are kind of unable to meet that volume obligation simply because their end market is a lot smaller than RFS2 forecasted?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, there is certainly the RIN process in place. There is also the expectation that as E15 gets into the market, it absorbs some of the -- obviously, it doesn't take much to get back to more in line with gasoline demand being ethanol -- if ethanol blends greater in the gasoline pool, and then also with exports. So I think the natural economic factors that allow greater blending and E15 being part of that is what Washington expects even as gasoline -- total gasoline consumption is flat or slightly down.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But exports aren't going to help you with your RFS2 obligation, correct?","Patricia A. Woertz","No. They just help with the overall production.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Overall production. And so even -- this is the difference between the RFS2 volume map out to 15 billion gallons and these CFRs that we got at the beginning of the year more on a percentage basis, you're -- not you though, but the blenders are more obligated on a volume basis than they are on a percentage so that even if we see gasoline demand flat to slightly down, they're not going to be adjusting based off of a percentage level. They're going to still be beholden to that 13.8 billion gallon requirement. Is that correct?","Patricia A. Woertz","That's correct.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Ray, the net invested working capital was down slightly year-on-year. How much are the unit prices in your working capital up and unit tons that you're carrying on working capital down?","Ray G. Young","Yes, a couple of comments on working capital. I mentioned that we did sell about $1 billion of receivables so that helps your working capital. When you look at the price volume variance on inventory, we're actually -- price had an impact of taking up inventory about $1 billion. And so the offset would be volume. So our absolute level of inventory in terms of volume is down but the price is up by approximately $1 billion year-over-year.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I mean, is that down because it's a little more difficult for you to source? Or are you purposely carrying it down because of your outlook on crop prices?","Ray G. Young","No. I mean, a couple of things. I mean, we consciously try to manage working capital and manage inventory. Plus also, it's just the -- we just time the year, the seasonal rental of inventory.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So that was looking at year-over-year. I mean, it's down a little bit, same season to last year.","Ray G. Young","Yes. And our inventory levels are generally down. As you saw in the ag services results, we just had fewer inventory in order to sell.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then how do you -- and this is for Pat, but how do you handle the stub period here with respect to your management targets? Do you have an incentive to get your returns up during the 6-month stub period before you go to the new fiscal year basis?","Patricia A. Woertz","Yes. We're looking at a stub year or a 6-month cycle for our incentive plan sort of in a -- in fact, we're doing -- we'll address that this week at our board meeting and then we'll start new with the calendar year in 2013. And yes, returns are very much part of our incentive recommendations.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then finally, just what was the $40 million provision for loss? Is that something we might expect on a recurring basis here until the market conditions improve?","Ray G. Young","No, John. That was a unique factor. So I view it as kind of one-off for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson of CL King.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc.","I just want to quickly talk -- ask a question on your ag services division in the quarter and your export number, which was down in the quarter. And I'm assuming that your soybean and your meal exports were actually pretty good and corn was pretty weak. Can you give me some flavor of what the 2, the direction of -- size direction of each of those commodities were in the quarter?","Craig E. Huss","Well, obviously, there was rationing going on in corn. And as crushed margins got better, we ran our plants harder and a lot of -- a big part of that would export, so not surprising at all, I don't think. Looking at last year's crop that there was rationing at the tail end of the crop, and it was little bit of a surprise. And I'd say the smaller South American crop gave us a nice run on the soy and on the meal exports.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc.","But then that meant that corn was particularly weak. Obviously, the rationing is pretty rampant at this point.","Craig E. Huss","Yes. And that's going to be rationed. As prices had to go higher, they are higher, and that creates front-end rationing, and that's what we've seen.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Sure, okay. And then if Ray could give me a little bit better feel. You talked about your credit availability flexibility to finance your higher working capital or your inventories coming this fall. If in fact you need to find other sources of financing, would you look at accounts receivable sales first or would you consider another preferred offering? I mean, can you give us a little flavor as to how much relative flexibility you have in financing your inventories this fall?","Ray G. Young","I think we have a lot of flexibility. I mean, like I say, even with the runup in commodity prices, we still have $3 billion available right now. And then we do have test capacity. I mean, we could go out right now and raise debt, both short term and long term, if we wanted to as well. So I feel pretty comfortable that -- and we've done some stress testing too, by the way, in terms of sensitivities under different price, volumes scenarios. So I think we can handle any additional runup that may occur.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on exports to Mexico for high-fructose corn syrup. Can you give us a sense -- are you charging more for those exports than you were just a few months ago? Are those tolling [ph] contracts based on the price of corn? And if so, how close are you to coming to like the breakeven on sugar? Do you see a risk that Mexico would switch to sugar at some point?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. Robert, our exports to Mexico continue growing. I think they're growing less rapidly than before but continues on a solid base. Certainly, with these high corn prices we get in -- the gap has narrowed. But at this point in time, there's still an advantage and we don't see a shift. And that's not only an economic shift just of fructose versus corn syrup, but also the handling of it. You need to handle it solid, and you need to melt it. So there are many other costs just versus -- just besides the pound per pound basis. So I think at this point, we don't see any potential for change in the short term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Horowitz of Topeka Capital Markets.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up, we've been hearing a lot about changes in water levels along the Mississippi River due to the drought and how that's impacting traffic on the river. Can you guys comment at all about how this may be impacting your business? And is there any way to kind of do a workaround around this critical path?","Craig E. Huss","Obviously, there has been -- with no rain, you get lower water levels. And we actually have seen a slight rise Memphis and south this week, but overall, we're still loading our barges to a 9-foot draft. We've seen several restrictions as we had to use narrower tows, smaller tows. It's a supply and demand deal, but right now, our costs are going up. I think the key for us is, can we get prices up to maintain operation? But I don't see us -- I don't see the river shutting down at this point. I think it's going to be a matter of competing with rail to be competitive. So at this point, we had some facilities that might be out due to low water and you'll see -- you'll continue to hear that a river section may be down for a day or so but they bring the dredges in, fix the channel and we go forward. We've had these -- we've had droughts many times.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Pat Woertz for closing remark.","Patricia A. Woertz","Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. And as always, feel free to follow up with Ruth Ann or Ray if you have any other questions, and have a good day. Thanks for your time and your interest.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mark Schweitzer, Vice President-Investor Relations for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. Schweitzer, you may begin.","Mark Schweitzer - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Jack. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's fourth quarter earnings webcast. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com.","For those following this presentation, please turn to slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflects management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance, and financial results. These statements are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Then, Juan will provide an update of our 2017 calendar year results, the progress of our strategy, and discuss our forward-look. And finally, they will take your questions.","Please turn to slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.82. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $793 million. First, I want to report that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we delivered the best quarterly employee safety record in our company's history. And in 2017, we have three separate months in which we achieved employee safety records. These are not minor or ancillary achievements. We, of course, value safety for its own sake, and we see that going hand-in-hand with overall performance.","We ended 2017 with a solid fourth quarter. We pulled the levers that were under control, including cost and capital initiatives and interventions throughout the year to help us deliver value for shareholders. For 2017 as a whole, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth, improved returns on invested capital, and generated positive EVA. And given our solid cash flows, earlier this morning we announced a dividend increase of $0.015, or 4.7%.","Looking forward, we continue to focus on our own actions to be the drivers of our success. Our increasing international presence and expanding capabilities in areas such as destination marketing, food and beverage innovations, and health and wellness, all help to position ADM for continued growth and value creation as we implement our strategy.","All of these factors lead us to be optimistic about 2018. When I look at ADM today, I see a company that is poised to capitalize on macro trends, harvest our recent investments, and reap even more benefits from our actions. Later on this call, I'll discuss further the outlook for our businesses.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.82, up from the $0.75 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $793 million, down $34 million from the year ago quarter.","Excluding the effects of U.S. tax reform, the effective tax rate was 24% for the quarter and year, below our forecasted annual tax rate of approximately 28% due to favorable discrete tax items. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was a positive 46% and includes a net estimate benefit from U.S. tax reform of $379 million. This benefit is comprised of a $528 million benefit from rerating of deferred tax assets and liabilities to 21% and a $369 million repatriation tax partially offset by $220 million benefit from releasing previously recorded deferred tax liabilities.","Looking forward into 2018, we expect the effective tax rate for ADM before discrete tax items to be in the range of 20% to 23%, down from the 28% to 30% level that we have previously communicated to you as our historical effective tax rates range. Our trailing four quarter adjusted ROIC of 6.4% is 40 basis points above our 2017 annual WACC of 6.0%, thus generating positive EVA of almost $100 million on a four quarter trailing average basis.","On chart 18 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. For this quarter, we had an $0.08 per share charge related to asset impairments restructuring activities and settlements, and a net positive benefit of $0.65 per share related to U.S. tax reform.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before discussing the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the corporate items affecting our quarterly results. In the corporate lines, net interest expense for the quarter was relatively flat at $78 million. Looking ahead, we're projecting net interest expense for calendar year 2018 to be relatively similar to the $310 million we recorded in 2017.","Unallocated corporate costs of $94 million were down versus the prior year, largely due to lower spending for special projects, reduced employee costs, and the lack of an expense in the year ago quarter related to an investment in a corporate initiative.","For 2018, we're expecting unallocated corporate costs in the range of the $140 million per quarter guidance that we provided to you for 2017 calendar year, with the company reinvesting in R&D, innovation, and readiness and business transformation activities that we deferred from 2017. Minority interest and other charges increased by $50 million, primarily due to the lack of a $38 million benefit in the year-ago quarter from an OPEB curtailment gain related changes to benefit plans.","Turning to the cash flow statement on slide 6. We generated $1.9 billion from operations before working capital changes, just down slightly versus the prior year. We had favorable changes in working capital of about $300 million, compared to a large use of working capital last year. So our operating cash flows, including working capital, were much higher than the prior-year period. Total capital spending was approximately $1 billion, in line with our recently updated expectations for the year. Looking ahead, we're planning for a reduction in capital spending in 2018 to approximately $800 million, as we expect to start harvesting the benefits of our recent investments.","We invested in various acquisitions amounting to $187 million. We returned approximately $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders throughout the year through dividends and share repurchases. We spent approximately $750 million to repurchase shares, less than the beginning of the year guidance, as our leverage and credit metrics approach our desired ranges.","For 2018, we do expect to repurchase shares at least at the level to offset dilution from benefit plans, and potentially more, subject to the strength of our operating cash flows and other uses of cash. All this will be in the context of our capital allocation framework. Our average share count for the quarter was 565 million diluted shares outstanding, down approximately 16 million shares from the beginning of this year.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our balance sheet remained strong. Our operating working capital of $7.4 billion is basically in line with the year ago period. Total debt was about $7.5 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $6.7 billion.","We finished the year with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%, a comfortable solid ratio for an investment grade company in this industry. Our shareholders' equity of $18.3 billion was up from the $17.2 billion level last year, primarily due to changes in the currency translation count as non-U.S. currency strengthened against the U.S. dollar. We had $5.5 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add the available cash, we had access to $6.3 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next I'll discuss our business performance for the quarter on slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $793 million of operating profit excluding specified items, down from the $827 million in last year's fourth quarter. For 2017 calendar year, despite some difficult operating conditions, our calendar year adjusted segment operating profit of $2.7 billion was slightly higher than 2016.","Now I'll review the performance of each of the segments. Starting on slide 9, Ag Services results were up over the prior year period. Merchandising and Handling was up year-over-year. Our Global Trade team executed well, delivering positive results for the third consecutive quarter, and we are continuing to see good contributions from our investments in destination marketing, including in Egypt and Israel, where we have expanded our capabilities in recent years. Merchandising and Handling results were also positively impacted by insurance claim settlements with our captive insurance operations and other income in the quarter. In North America, we continue to see a lack of competitiveness for U.S. grain exports, which negatively impacted both volumes and margins.","Transportation results decreased from their prior-year period due to lower barge loadings and freight values. Icy conditions towards the end of the quarter also impacted river traffic. Milling and Other earnings were down year-over-year due to lower volumes and margins.","Now turning to slide 10, Corn Processing had a solid quarter, with higher results over the prior-year period. Sweetener and Starches delivered another strong performance in the quarter, with good sales growth and solid margins, particularly in our North American liquid sweeteners business. Our European operations, which we expanded significantly in recent years, including with the recent acquisitions of Chamtor, continued to deliver good results.","Bioproduct results were down compared to the prior-year period. Ethanol industry margins were lower, as production pushed stocks higher. However, the team's strong risk management execution offset a significant portion of these negative impacts. Animal Nutrition was significantly higher than the year-ago quarter, as ongoing efforts to improve our cost positions in the specialty feed ingredients business continued to bear fruit.","Turning to slide 11, Oilseeds Processing results were down compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Crushing and Origination was down versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Crush volumes were strong, although margins were weak globally. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see the indicators of improving global demand for soybean meal as the effects of alternate proteins diminished and livestock numbers continued to increase. Therefore, we saw margins trend up late in the fourth quarter. Weakness in South American Origination margins and volumes negatively impacted results.","Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other results were lower versus the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to the lack of the biodiesel tax credit in this year's results. Refined and package oils delivered a solid quarter, benefiting from improved volumes in all regions and a solid margin environment. Asia was up slightly over the prior year period on the Wilmar results.","Now onto slide 12, the WFSI team turned a solid quarter, with results up over the year-ago period. WILD Flavors delivered double-digit operating growth, driven by sales increases across all regions, as well as some margin improvements. Specialty Ingredients results were up versus a difficult year-ago period. The business continues to see the benefits after significant self-help actions throughout the last year, including improved inventory management and innovation in finding new uses for products. We saw margin improvement in several businesses in the quarter, particularly natural health and nutrition and the benefits from improved cost positioning in proteins.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Juan. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to slide 13. I'd like to take a moment to reflect a little bit about 2017 as a whole, how we advanced our strategy, how we took important measures to improve execution and control costs and capital, and how all of our actions helped contribute to our results for the year.","We finished 2017 with adjusted EPS 12.5% higher than 2016, with higher adjusted operating profits for the full year than 2016, with solid operating cash flows, and with returns on our invested capital well-above WACC resulting in positive EVA and shareholder value creation. All told, our team achieved almost $400 million of monetizations in 2017, grew sales in targeted areas by more than $500 million, generated $285 million of run-rate cost savings, and returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders.","As I mentioned earlier, we had our best quarterly employee safety record ever. In addition, December was the safest month we've ever recorded and two other months in 2017 rank among our very safest. And we did this all while still remaining true to the value creation strategy we set out in 2014 by enhancing our core, advancing readiness, and growing strategically, particularly in the parts of our value chain that are closer to the end customer.","I'm proud of our team for continuing to focus on our strategy, even while managing the day-to-day execution that is so critical for our success. We've been consistent in running our business today and positioning our business for tomorrow and beyond. For example, in our first strategic pillar, enhancing the core, each business contributed, making sure they were investing time and money as efficiently and effectively as possible to deliver value day-in and day-out.","Ag Services divested our Crop Risk Service business and took aggressive actions to strengthen execution in our Global Trade operations. Our Corn team has delivered important yield and productivity improvements in lysine, resulting in a turnaround of that business. Oilseeds announced the sale of our Bolivian Oilseeds operations and worked hard to diversify our oil streams into a wider variety of products to help capture steady margins. WFSI continued to deliver sales synergies throughout 2017, with a pipeline of more than 2,000 individual projects.","And our second pillar, enhancing readiness, is one that is a little bit more behind the scenes, but is critical to our success. We had some important readiness accomplishments in 2017. We have rolled out our 1ADM business transformation project across several of our business and regions, as we continue to standardize our business processes around the globe. We are pleased with the results we're seeing with 1ADM, and looking forward to continuing rollouts throughout 2018.","Our operational excellence efforts have yielded important improvements as we leverage technology and best practices to reduce energy intensity, improve yields, and streamline processes. Each business contributed to the impressive run-rate cost savings we delivered in 2017.","Our Corn team is advancing their performance excellence initiative, a rigorous program that is empowering, engaging and, enabling frontline colleagues to help improve and standardize processes across the business. Two plants have completed the first year of this program and we plan to launch it in several other locations this year.","In our third pillar, strategic growth, we have continued to invest to grow our capabilities further down the value chain. Our Ag Services business continued to enhance its ability to offer end-to-end solutions for customers with investments in destination marketing, particularly our new ADM Israel joint venture. For the year, the team delivered 20% growth in destination market in volumes.","The Corn team continued to expand its global Sweeteners and Starches footprint with the acquisition of Chamtor in France and enhancements at our former Eaststarch facilities in Turkey and Bulgaria. We're also continuing to build our animal nutrition capabilities, including new feed pre-mix facilities in China and we entered the pet treats business with the acquisition of Crosswind Industries.","WFSI opened innovation centers in China, Australia, and just a couple of weeks ago Singapore. This state-of-the-art research and development facilities allow ADM scientists to work hand-in-hand with food and beverage customers to meet all of their needs for taste, nutrition, function, and texture. We acquired Biopolis and entered to a research agreement with Mayo Clinic, both of which expanded our capabilities in the important and growing area of personalized nutrition, probiotics and prebiotics that may improve digestive health.","And we are expanding our bioactives capabilities in the animal health and nutrition markets as well by entering into a joint development agreement with Vland Biotech in China to develop and commercialize enzymes for animal feed. In the coming months, we'll be opening up a new research lab in California to support that work.","Our team has delivered substantial achievements in advancing our strategy, while balancing the pace of investment with our disciplined approach to returns and delivering current value for shareholders. We are very focused on returns and cash flows. We generated almost $2 billion of operating cash flows in a period when margin conditions in many of our businesses were at the lower end of their historic ranges. That is why we are confident about increasing our quarterly dividend by almost 5%.","We are proud to have increased dividends for more than 25 consecutive years and issued more than 86 years of uninterrupted dividends. By executing our strategy and being disciplined about our capital allocation framework, we are delivering value today, even while we're building for a bigger, even better tomorrow.","Before we take your questions, I would like to offer our outlook for 2018. We're looking to take the momentum that we have generated through the actions we implemented in 2017 and continue strong in 2018. Between our strategy, our execution in all three of our pillars, and the benefits of tax reform, we are looking forward to a good year as our strategy continues to unfold throughout the next several quarters.","Let me talk for a moment about the first quarter. In Ag Services, we're planning for continued opportunities in Global Trade and destination marketing. The South American crop will be moving into global markets, which will impact the competitiveness of U.S. agricultural exports. We expect Ag Services' Q1 performance to be largely in line with the prior-year period.","In Corn, margins in the Sweeteners and Starches business, as well as in ethanol, will experience normal seasonal patterns during the quarter. Animal Nutrition should see stronger results thanks to revenue growth and improved cost positions. Altogether, we think we are likely to see a first quarter for Corn that is in line with the prior-year quarter.","In Oilseeds, we're optimistic about the recent movements in crush, as the margin outlook is positive due to increasing demand and improved trade flows. We are planning for continued strong results from our RPBO businesses, although the status of the U.S. biodiesel blenders' credit creates uncertainty in biodiesel margins. We expect Q1 in Oilseeds to be lower than the first quarter of last year. In WFSI, we are planning for Q1 results similar to the strong first quarter of 2017 as Campo Grande ramps up and we continue to see solid sales and earnings growth from WILD.","Looking to the full year, although we continue to see certain green shoots, we are planning conservatively. Hence, we continue to focus on the levers we can control. We have a good base from this quarter and this year in which to build, and we are looking for a year of solid earnings and EPS growth. Here's how I think about growth from the perspective of four components.","First, as you might recall, we took actions earlier in 2017 to fix what we call leakages, things we did not do as well as we should. We're seeing the results of our initiatives to end those leakages, and this will benefit our earnings in 2018. There are probably about $100 million of leakages that impacted 2017 results that should be mitigated in 2018.","Second, we will continue to reduce costs. We'll see the results from the run-rate cost savings we achieved last year, and we'll take additional readiness actions. We have set the target for $200 million in new run-rate savings by the end of 2018. Third, we will benefit from our growth initiatives. We'll see the full-year results of the investments we made in 2017, and all four businesses will continue to invest in new growth both organically and through M&A, particularly on the right-hand side of the value chain. And finally, we will see the benefits of lower tax expense from U.S. tax reform.","That is why I feel optimistic about 2018. We're going to continue to execute and we're going to continue to grow earnings, improve returns, and generate value for our shareholders. And I also feel good about our future beyond 2018. Whether we think about feeding a growing population or the clean labels and natural solutions that are in high demand today, or consumers looking for proactive approaches to health and nutrition, we are very well positioned to deliver and create value.","So before we open up the call for questions about our results, I want to make one final comment. Obviously, we are well aware of the recent stories in the press about ADM and Bunge. As we move to Q&A, I'm sure you understand that we're not going to comment on these sort of matters, but we do look forward to taking your questions about our earnings and forward outlook.","So, Jack, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken. How are you?","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good. A couple questions. One is, when you talk about the outlook of your businesses, the first quarter seems to be a little bit lighter than last year, but yet you're talking about growth. Where do you see \u2013 which divisions do you expect to see the greatest degree of growth from to be able to offset some of the weakness in the first quarter, and how is that going to develop through the year? And then I have a follow-up.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Ken. I think we see WFSI should have a very good year. At the last earnings call, if you recall, we talked a little bit about $30 million of P&L impact in the 2017 results due to some of the investments and start-ups that we were making during both 2016 and 2017 we should not have in 2018, and we're going to start seeing the benefits of those plans coming into operations. So, we feel very strongly about WFSI will have a much better year than 2017.","We see Corn continue to grow, Sweeteners and Starches, the business internationally, and the North American business should be able to maintain the margins that we achieved in 2017. We see, of course, some uncertainty for the calendar year with overall industry ethanol margins, but we are particularly encouraged about the demand side of ethanol, especially from exports, where we think that they're going to grow into China and Brazil this year having been major contributors.","For Oilseeds, we are very encouraged how the supply\/demand appears to be getting tighter for mill and oil, and we've seen that a little bit through this quarter, and we've seen that in Q1. So, our plants are running hard, and we see a lot the headwinds that we had last year subsiding this year, whether it was the competing alternative proteins or a lot of crush from Argentina or some issues in terms of avian flu and all that that have subsided for the most part.","For Ag Services, I think you saw a little bit of this quarter. I think there was very effective management of the business in 2017 we reduced and we optimized some of the operations in Global Trade and we expanded destination marketing. And we're going to see a better result from that, mostly self-help improvements as the year go by. So, we still feel very strongly, as I said, about 2018 in the different businesses. When you put on top of that our cost improvements that we continue to execute on and the benefit of a lower tax rate, we see a very strong 2018 and another year of growth earnings for us.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And my just second question is, when I think about your strategic initiatives over the long term, has anything changed in terms of how you look at where you need to be in a couple of years? It seems like over the last couple of years, you really did focus on value-added products and kind of minimizing or trying to reduce the expansion into Oilseeds. Has that changed? Will that change? What do you think about that going forward for the next two to three years?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Ken, we have a growth strategy and our growth strategy, our growth part of it has three pillars fundamentally that we've been implemented, and I think we've been consistent over the last few years. One was the geographic expansion. We continue to make ADM better balanced geographically, and we've done a good job of completing the value chain in Europe. If you think about six, seven years ago, Europe was mostly Oilseeds business. Now, we have our Ag Services as we bought Toepfer. Now we have also milling in the UK. We also bought Eaststarch and we expanded corn also with Chamtor, and now we have WFSI. So Europe has been built to the extent that the U.S. is built, and now it's a matter of driving returns.","We've done the same in South America, but South America is trailing Europe in that regard, and the same has happened with Southeast Asia. So that will continue, but it's very selectively, and we said strategically invest, because we don't want to just invest to be big. We just want to invest to plug holes in our value chain. So that's one aspect.","The second aspect was getting to the 25% of Wilmar that we have gotten, and we implemented that last year. And the third aspect of growth was to continue to drive the market-facing units, the growth in it, whether it's food and beverages, whether it's personalized nutrition, whether it's animal nutrition, and we will continue to do so.","So those are the three allocations of capital, if you will, and the three strategic thrusts from a growth perspective, and we haven't deviated from that. We opportunistically do one or the other depending (00:34:25) achieving the best returns. But strategically that continues to be the focus.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hi, David.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Ray, could you just go back over the tax reform benefits. I think you gave a range of 20% to 23% and the 2017 tax rate was 24%. So it sounds like at the top end it's only 100 basis point benefit, but give us some understanding as to how big a benefit the tax reform was? And then I'm sure the range has something to do with the geographic mix, but I'd just like to hear your thoughts on tax.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. For 2017, David, the rate was 24%, but it was 28% if you exclude some of the discrete items. So, we did have some favorable tax items in 2018. Normally, these discrete items could be plus or minus. Last year 2016, it was a minus. This year, it's a plus. How I would like to think about it is like 28% is kind of like our normalized rate. So, therefore, with U.S. tax reform, we'll go from a 28% type of rate to a 21% to 23% rate. That's how I kind of think about it, David. So, in the context \u2013 I mean, just to give you context, so for 2017, if you take the midpoint of the range, say, 20% to 23%, which is 21.5%, relative to 28% on our $1.6 billion of pre-tax profit, it's about $100 million of benefit if you were to apply that into our 2017 results.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then because of these tax benefits, was there any change to kind of your investment strategy? Did you reinvest some of this money that you otherwise wouldn't have?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","The way to think about it, David, is the additional cash flows, in my example, the $100 million benefit in 2017 if we had tax reform, I would view it in the context of our capital allocation framework. So, therefore, our offering cash flows will actually go up by $100 million. And then we will actually invest that cash into context of our allocation framework, which is, as you know, the three pillars, being there's capital investments, there's return of capital to shareholders, and there's M&A. So, that's how I would be thinking about it. There's nothing specifically targeted towards the $100 million, but it goes into the context of our allocation framework in terms of how we're going to maximize shareholder value.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Juan, just one question for you and I'll pass it along here, but on Ag Services, this business has been kind of all over the map in terms of quarterly profitability. This quarter looks like a nice quarter. Can you talk about the investment strategy in Agricultural Services? Can you distinguish between CapEx versus acquisitions within the segment, and then just how high on the priority list is any kind of investments or building up scales in Ag Services? How high on the priority list is this versus all your other priorities?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, David. So, Ag Services is a very important part of our business. The reason we said before that we were going \u2013 and I think we said it in the last quarter earnings, that we were going to deemphasize maybe the capital into that area is because, as we look at the world going forward, the increase in production will come mostly from yield. So for more intensity, more precision agriculture, but about the same area. So we didn't feel that from an Ag Services perspective to keep our share of origination, we needed actually to go geographically to add to our footprint.","So we continue to add to make more efficient that chain, to make that seamless integration between the grain business and the processing businesses. And in places where we feel underrepresented or we need some asset, we've been putting the asset. So, the investments in El Tr\u00e1nsito in Argentina we made last in the port, the investment in the Porto de Santos, the investment in the port of \u2013 the northern part of Brazil.","So, think we've been doing that. We continue to improve our barge line in the Danube River. So, I think it's just a matter of where do we see the need. And at this point in time, we felt the need to build capabilities what's higher in the right side of the value chain versus in the left side, given what we see going forward.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. I'll pass it along.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Okay. You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thank you. Juan, I wanted to focus specifically on your comments three months ago about pulling back on capital spending in Oilseeds. Can you just remind us what that was in reaction to? Was it in reaction to your view of global supply and demand balance being out of balance? And what is your view now, as it is \u2013 do you think it's a more attractive balance today than it was three months ago?","And then secondly, how much leverage would you be willing to take on to do the right type of acquisition? You've, obviously, become more M&A focused. Most of us thought that single A rating was kind of sacrosanct at ADM, and I wanted to know your thoughts on that. Thanks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Good morning, Rob. So, let's take the question in two parts. So, the first one is a little bit of continuation of the question from David in terms of our allocation of capital through the value chain. What we felt, as we look at our business, is, as I was saying before, that the left side, if you will, has been more developed over time in ADM. That's why we went geographically everywhere with Ag Services and Oilseeds. Actually, was Oilseeds first and then we back integrated into grain. So, naturally, Ag Services and Oilseeds has been earlier into Europe, earlier into South America and with Wilmar earlier into Asia.","So, what we were planning to do with the value chain is actually beef up the right side of, if you will, Corn and WFSI, just because of our lack of volume or our lack of critical mass in different geographies. We are not in Corn in South America, we were not in Corn in Europe, and then we needed to build the value chain to make ingredients with our complete footprint. So, that was a little bit the discussion about we didn't need that much on the left side versus the right side.","In terms of our expectation for Oilseeds is, we are running today basically as hard as we can, and we are maximizing every shift that we can to soy in our footprint as long as it makes sense. So we are very bullish about that market in particular. The issue is the business has many opportunities to apply operational excellence and continue to extract more from those plants. And before building new investments, we'd rather debottleneck and make \u2013 and continue to build those plants into very integrated facilities. Our facilities are very well-integrated with refineries, with switch capacity. And I think the end game here is, can you grow having your assets more efficient more than just having diverse assets, isolated assets out there?","So, we will continue to build that footprint, but that footprint, as you build in existing footprint, makes capital investments more efficient, if you will, than in other places where we need to build a new capacity. So, in terms of the availability of capital, it's naturally shifted to the right not because of any lack of demand on the left side. It's more like what we're trying to build and the footprints we started from. So, strategically, not much have changed in that sense.","Maybe on the other one, I'll let Ray \u2013 it was about...","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. So, Rob, on the question, we view our balance sheet at ADM as being a competitive strength, and that's the reason why we have maintained a very strong balance sheet. Over time, you've seen us increase our leverage. And as I indicated in the call, we're around 27% net debt to total capital ratio in terms of leverage position, which I view is actually a very comfortable position for our company where we are right now.","It is important to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to weather volatility in the markets. We saw what happened in the equity markets yesterday. I mean, these things can happen in the ag commodity markets as well. We've seen in the past whereby commodity price spikes could cause $4 billion to $5 billion increases in working capital. So, therefore, it is important for us to maintain a solid balance sheet with a solid investment grade credit rating.","You asked the question, will we ever divert from our A rating, from my perspective, you never can say never, but from my perspective we've got so many avenues in order to raise capital for our company, whether it'd be through some of the monetizations that we've done. We've done partnerships with people. We buy equity. So, therefore, from my perspective, maintaining a solid investment grade credit rating, a solid balance sheet is paramount for us to allow for flexibility in terms of handling working capital spikes, as well as maintaining flexibility in terms of managing our portfolio.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","So, Ray, is that what's factored into your decision to stop the share repurchase at $750 million this year and not extend further, because you thought that the balance sheet was where you want it to be?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. As I kind of look at the metrics in terms of debt to total capital, as well as debt to EBITDA, we felt that those ratios were approaching levels whereby we felt comfortable. And frankly, I do feel comfortable where we are right now. Now, going forward, as I indicated, in 2018 our plans for share repurchases is reduced more or less to offset dilution. But again, this is all in the context of like what kind of additional cash flows we can generate if we have additional monetizations that we were going to do. That could open up more flexibility to do additional share repurchases as well. So, therefore, again, everything's in the context for capital allocation framework that we announced back in 2014.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Maybe this question is for Ray on the back of the lower tax rate. Can you talk about what that does to your weighted average cost of capital for 2018 or long term? And your cost of debt's probably gone up, how should we think about that? And then given that you have a lower normalized tax rate going forward, should we anticipate that your hurdle rate for 200 basis points above the cost of capital is now obsolete and it should be 300 basis points or something different? Could you just talk about that?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Sure. In terms of our annual WACC for 2018, we did go through the analysis in terms of adjusting for tax rates, interest rates, risk premiums, as well as beta. So, we actually went through the full in the month of January. And where we ended up after going through all those numbers is that, we'll be increasing it in 2018 to 6.25% factoring all those various components.","With respect to our hurdle rates, as you know, we set our hurdle rates very, very high, well above cost of capital. And in addition, as you know, our long-term return objectives remain at 10%. So when we went through the analysis, even on our long-term WACC factoring in all the updated analyses, our long-term WACC number of 7% is still consistent with what it should be based upon the calculations. But we agree that the short-term WACC or the annual WACC number, based on the revisions of interest rates and tax rates, is going to move up to 6.25%.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And your target then for your own returns for 2018 have gone up correspondingly? Is that the way we should think about it?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I mean, as you know, Ann, we always want to strive to get returns well above our annual WACC, so that will be our objective here.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. And then more strategically, we've heard a lot about Section 199A and the law of unforeseen consequences as a result of the tax bill. There is a lot of talk out there that it will get revised. How would it impact your business, both Ag Services and perhaps the ethanol business, if it does not get revised, and what are you guys hearing? What's happening around that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Ann. So, it is clear that it wasn't the intent of the revised 199A provision to make this change in the industry, if you will. And so our team has been engaging in Washington on that, and we have received assurances from senior members of both the Senate and the House that they recognize that Section 199A has significant unintended consequence, and it will be fixed legislatively certainly in the near future.","So, I would say at this point in time, very minor impact we have felt commercially. And when you heard yesterday Chairman Brady making expressions about this will be technically revised, I think that have a calming effect on markets, and whether it's coming now or coming in the next month, it's coming in the near future. So, as I said, we have received assurances of that, and we believe that will happen.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And if it drags on, Juan, is there a point in time \u2013 as we go into spring or summer, is there a point to time where you'll be incrementally negatively impacted potentially?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","If we didn't act, it will. But, of course, the team has been looking at options and we are working on \u2013 in parallel on potential options to offset that. We don't want to go there. We think that technically it will be revised, and that's our main thrust. But, of course, we're not going to sit idle and see ourselves losing share.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in line. Thank you. Appreciate the color.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Ann. Yeah.","Operator>: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Your line is open.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hi, Jones Heather.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Heather.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Hi. I wanted to talk about Oilseeds. So you're bullish and talked about running your plants as hard as you can. The cash margins that we're looking at in U.S. are showing very significant year-on-year improvement. But I was wondering, the wheat protein content that I've been reading about and beans and all, is that impacting your operating cost or anything. Trying to figure out how to analyze those margins in light of the lower protein content.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. No, at this point in time, we continue to see the improving margins. Actually, at this point through all our operations, I would say, whether it's Paraguay when the lower crush in Argentina, whether it's European soy crush, Brazil, North America, so I think that in general, we have seen this wave of improvement. I think that part of the issue is wheat is \u2013 their relationship with corn make them less competitive, if you will, to be in the Russians (00:50:52) at this point in time, does not (00:50:54) help soybean mill.","So I would say, at this point in time, we continue to see opportunities. I'm very bullish about that business as it develops. We have noticed in some parts of the business a little bit of lower protein, but we don't see a big impact at this point in time that's making change our forecast.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","And so I'm curious as to why you all think Oilseeds will be down in Q1. I mean, there is a difficult comp in the Asia piece, Wilmar. But you definitely sound far more constructive than you did on the Q4 call last year and honestly, more constructive than you had in a while. So do you just not expect enough improvement in those other businesses to offset that year-on-year comp for Wilmar?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","A couple of things. You know as our margins expand, sometimes we take negative mark-to-markets, which will have to be reflected probably in Q1. And also, we still have the uncertainty of the biodiesel tax credit, which is difficult to know. Obviously, last year we had it. So far this year we don't have it. So, as we think about that, and as you point the third factor, which is last year Wilmar has an unusual tax impact that they normally won't get this year, so even if their results were good, we will still be trailing last year. So, those are the reasons for my comment of being low versus \u2013 or being under last year results.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay. You said the blenders' tax credit. You guys recognized the benefit from that in Q1 of 2017, because I don't think it was it was in place...","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No, there obviously was not. (00:52:36)","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","No, there was no benefit there. And all we're saying is that we're not counting...","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","We're not counting it.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","We're not counting it in 2018 first quarter, although there are strong indications that that may get approved sometime in the first quarter. But we're not actually forecasting it in our plans right now.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, a lot of grounds has been covered. I guess, I wanted to think about the things that you can control in 2018. Juan, I think, you alluded to $100 million of \u2013 I think you called them leakages from 2017 results. Maybe just a little bit color of the areas. I'm guessing it's lysine, maybe WFSI, areas that were a bit more underperforming versus your initial plans in 2017, as well as the cost savings, just the businesses where you actually expect to see those come through. And then I have a follow-up.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. So, some of the leakages \u2013 and I may get the buckets right 90% of the time, but I would say one important one is what we mentioned in Ag Services, the Global Trade operations. I think the team has done a tremendous job of closing offices that actually did not perform well historically and we have some of that. We have restructured and combined offices in places where there was an opportunity. So there is a lot of cost they are taking out of there and there are improved operations. We have shut down Bolivia and sold Bolivia. We have restructured Peoria in terms of taking 100 million gallons of fuel ethanol out of there.","You pointed out, there were a couple of issues in some small acquisitions in WFSI, in the case of SCI, is a very much on trend type of product, all the ancient grains and seeds. They have a very soft first half of last year from a demand perspective, and also we have some operations problems. We restructured that. We split those operations, and they are very, very \u2013 much better managed these days. And we have seen demand of that coming back up in the second half, so we \u2013 to the point the demand was flat year-over-year, because second half was strong.","So, I would say, if you take those combinations, there were leakages in every business, if you will. And we have a portfolio of products that we look at, and we assign an improvement forecast for the following year with actions on that. So it's a very disciplined approach. And this is one of our pillars of that improvement. That package of improvement year-over-year is about $100 million, and we feel comfortable that we have enough actions there to deliver on those.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the cost savings, kind of \u2013 I think it was \u2013 kind of where we should see those flow through the results and by business?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I think that in the cost savings, we have this program. We've been running it for \u2013 I don't know \u2013 five years, six years, something like that. I think that cumulated savings have been about $1 billion already. So this year, we look at that again. It's about $200 million run-rate savings. I would say, normally, Corn leads these, because it has the largest plants. But I would say last year was a strong contribution from also the other three businesses, Ag Services, Oilseeds, and WFSI. I think you're going to see a continuation of Corn and a pickup in Oilseeds in terms of contribution to that. So, that will be the $200 million this year.","Lysine, in all that, you mentioned it before, and I would like to give kudos to the team. They make a significant improvement this year in terms of yields, and that we are about halfway those improvements. So part of that will also come in 2018.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Adam, how I would be thinking about this on a year-over-year basis, the $200 million that Juan talks about is a run-rate savings at the end of the year related to our readiness initiatives. We also have some of the benefits from 2017 that will flow into 2018. And actually some of these savings we actually reinvest back into our business, as well as there's going to be offsetting inflation. So, how I would be thinking about the cost savings, Adam, is year-over-year from 2017 to 2018 the net pickup in terms of cost savings will be about $100 million. That's how I would be thinking about from a modeling perspective.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's some helpful color. And then just a question on the Sweeteners side. I think you had some constructive comments on the international components, the expansions that you've done in Europe and some of the acquisitions. I didn't hear a lot about the North America business. Maybe just any thoughts on how the liquid sweetener contracting for 2018 has taken place and kind of the competitive changes in the market with the new sugar agreement that's kind of rolling in through the balance of 2018 in the U.S. and Mexico?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. So, Sweeteners and Starches continued to do well in North America. If we look at the combined demand, if I look at the combined demand for wet milling products in North America, combined domestic and export, was up modestly in 2017 versus 2016. So we still see our capacity being pressured there. Total demand actually for liquid sweeteners in North America was also up slightly year-over-year. Overall, I would say, we are pleased with the mix of sweetener contracting in North America for 2018, with pricing that will protect our overall North American margins in line with 2017. So, we continue to see positive developments there.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's all. That's very helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Okay. Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. First...","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hi, Eric.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks, guys. First, maybe I missed this. This is probably a question for Ray. Did you give us what your CapEx spend is supposed to be for what you're targeting for CapEx spend 2018?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, it's $800 million. We talked about that in the last quarter as well. And as we finalize the plan, we believe the $800 million level would be the right level of CapEx for 2018.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then when you kind of look at \u2013 we haven't had an ethanol question, but Juan did allude to the fact that they're encouraged with a strong demand function. I think we entered the 2017 with about $1.3 billion of exports. Give us an idea of what you might think that number could be for 2018.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, Eric, we estimate exports last year probably ended a little bit higher maybe than $1.3 billion. Our team would probably put it at $1.4 billion. We saw a pickup late in the year into exports to China or Brazil. And we see that drive in 2018 to probably a number between $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion. Brazil, China coming back to big exporters into big importers from U.S. and continue with some of the traditional destinations, Canada, India, Gulf States. So, we see strong demand in Brazil and we see China driving into their 10% and not having enough capacity to supply that. So we will have China and Brazil for the next two or three years being big importers from North America ethanol.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then just kind of a final kind of 30,000-foot overall question with kind of the Ag Services division. Obviously, we still have a lot of global supply. Looks like we're still going to \u2013 that's going to be one should be conservative when you look out for the next year as well on that. But it's also interesting that we're seeing some corn production coming out of the Ukraine. It looks like China is down a little bit. It's looks like Brazil could \u2013 it looks like we're not \u2013 it's not really visible, but we might be on a path of road to maybe getting some lower carry overs in the Corn area. Is there any semblance that that could be an improvement for your overall Ag Services for next year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, Eric, I think if we go around the world, and you mentioned some of them in your comments, we already know enough probably to conclude that 2018 weather will be less favorable to crops than it has been \u2013 that weather has been over the last four years. So, whether it's Argentine dryness or whether it's the South Plains here or whether it's a little bit of Russia or Australia commentary or whether it's South Africa having a drought and impacting corn, we see things tightening up a little bit at the time when demand continues to be very strong. So, that could bode well for Ag Services business, yes.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think that is something to watch closely. Okay. Thank you, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Eric.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Farha.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Juan, you've talked about harvest investments in your Chairman's perspective. Could you share with us what your key investments are, and kind of what harvests or benefits we expect in 2018 from those investments?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Well, there are many. I can go through the different businesses. So, we're going to have the full year of some of the acquisitions that we made, whether it's Chamtor or Crosswind, in pet treats or industry centers in the destination marketing. We're going to have Campo Grande, the largest specialty protein complex that there is that we started in South America. Those are six plants into one complex, and that took us the last 18 months to bring into production and we're going to have a full year of that in 2018.","We will have the benefit of Tianjin. We're going to have the Fibersol plant having a full year of operation. We have expanded our color plant in Berlin. We are expanding some of our Eaststarch facilities in Eastern Europe. So, there has been many (01:03:58) around our business. And that's why I always remark that I'm very proud how we manage cash flow and we manage earnings on these two years of soft commodity markets, if you will, while we were heavily investing.","We thought that \u2013 I explained to all of you before that some of the valuations in the market did not justify have to go into big hunting for M&A, and we decided to go organic growth. We took a hit in the P&L over the last two years in that, and we believe that all that is coming on stream. Of course, you don't make money day one the moment you turn on a plant. So our forecast will be more back-end loaded as these plants ramp-up and they start to be completely sold out, but we believe that all that will contribute in 2018. And that's why our forecast, going back to the original question from Ken, is our forecast go from a relatively more flattish Q1 to a higher expectation for calendar year 2018 as a whole versus 2017 is because of this ramp-up of some of these investments.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And just some more detail on ethanol. So you in the fourth quarter were short ethanol. And now kind of going forward, could you talk about some of your color on hedges and your outlook and kind of how that market will develop, and any color on how you think profitability for the year will flow for ethanol and what you think about the divestiture of those ethanol dry mills?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Okay. So let me see if I can cover (01:05:45) all that. The team did very well in Q4 managing the end of the year. And as we look at what happened now, so margins were not very good going into this quarter. And, of course, as always happen during this time of the year, plants in the industry don't run that well in the winter. They run at a slower capacity. And this shows when the industry have some discipline, if you will, in productions, margins start to climb up, driven mostly by exports, steel, gasoline domestic demand is not something to write home about, but exports continue to be good.","So, in that sense, we expect a little bit of better margins now. Then we're going to have the normal development every year, which is refineries and everybody goes into maintenance in preparation for the dry wind season and, hopefully, we're going to have a good dry wind season, and we're going to see margins come up into the summer. Then we're going to produce too much in the summer, like we do every year, and maybe margins temper towards the end of the year.","In terms of our progress into the ethanol dry mills, we made the restructuring into Peoria, and I would say we will continue to look at opportunities. We are engaged with people, but we're not going to make any decision that is bad for our shareholders. We don't have a rush to do anything here. We make cash flows. So, strategically, we're not going to build one building the next dry mill. And at the right time, at the right \u2013 in the right conditions, we are planning to divest or joint venture those dry mills. At this point in time, nothing to update you on.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results as well as the drivers of our performance. Then Juan will discuss our forward look, and finally, they will take your questions.","Please turn to Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.77, down from $0.92 in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $764 million. Our team delivered solid results this quarter.","We stayed focused on the levers we could control advancing our strategic plan despite the difficult external environment. North American grain export volumes and margins remained limited. Crush margins were part of the record high 2018 levels and ethanol industry margins remained challenged. Despite all of these, we delivered the performance consistent with the perspectives we provided last quarter, including the strong year-over-year growth in our nutrition business.","Throughout the quarter, we continued to deliver on our strategic plan. In our optimize pillar we are successfully capturing synergies offered by the midyear combination of our Ag Services and Oilseeds business. By looking at the combined value chain of the new business, we've identified a wide range of opportunities to improve capital efficiency.","We have already executed more than $200 million of capital reduction initiatives. As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our U.S. origination footprint, we completed our previously announced transaction with Cargill to exchange grain elevators in Illinois and Indiana. We also celebrated the opening of our new state-of-the-art mill in Mendota, Illinois, an important milestone in our ongoing process of replacing older, higher cost plants with more efficient facilities.","And as we anticipated earlier this year, we're starting to see the positive impact of the measures we took to improve the long-term reliability of our Decatur complex. In our drive pillar, we are continuing to see growing benefits of the improved analytics, technologies and processes we put in place after we launched Readiness last year.","We're implementing innovative uses of AI, machine learning and robotic process automation across the Company to do everything from identifying and solving IT issues to reducing costs and improving efficiencies in our global business services center to helping our customer-facing teams, meet needs with more speed and flexibility.","On the organizational redesign we completed in the first half of the year, including transforming our IT foundational services and centralizing our global operations organization is delivering higher service levels at lower costs. In our expand pillar, a key element of our growth strategy is focusing on major global trends, trends that have the potential to fundamentally change markets and in which we are solidifying our global leadership position.","The first of those game-changing trends is one we see in the headlines every day now, flexitarian diets. ADM has a rich history of a leader in plant-based meat alternatives. Today, our full pantry of great tasting, innovative flavors, ingredients & solutions make us the provider of choice for customers looking to grow with this fast moving market.","Our new plant protein facilities in Campo Grande, Brazil and Enderlin, North Dakota are supporting the increased demand from our global customer base. And in the third quarter, we entered into a partnership with the world's largest beef patty producer to co-develop and produce a 100% alternative protein burger that is now being offered in Brazil.","Another major global trend is nutrition for health. We are capitalizing on our investments in Biopolis and Protexin with the goal of building a leadership position in science-based microbiome solutions for human and animal health. There are tremendous opportunities here, such as our recent announcement of promising results from clinical trials of our probiotics for skin health.","Another growing trend is sustainable materials. Our long-standing expertise and technology and fermentation and our research and development capabilities give us industry-leading abilities to provide the review of feedstocks and underpin the creation of innovative sustainable progress.","Last year in partnership with DuPont, we opened the world's first production facility for SBME, which has applications as a sustainable replacement for plastics. On last month, we announced an agreement with LG Chem to develop sustainable super-absorbent polymers. This is a growing earlier and we plan to continue to expand our presence on it.","Please turn to Slide 4. Readiness continues to underpin our strategic work and help drive our results. This quarter our list of completed initiatives has grown to 218 which taken together will account for about $515 million in run rate benefits on an annual basis. We remain on target for our two year goal of $1.2 billion in annual run rate benefits by the end of 2020.","As of the end of the third quarter, Readiness have contributed close to $200 million in 2019 in year accrued results. We are confident we will reach our goal of $250 million to $300 million of accrued benefits by the end of this year. Finally, more than half of our global workforce of 40,000 has now completed our comprehensive ability to execute or aid to retraining since we began the program.","This training is a critical part of Readiness. It lays the foundation for the permanent culture change that we're working to instill to make our Company better. In some ways, we are entering a new phase of Readiness. We are moving on to a more complex to more complex projects that will take longer to complete, but will deliver more fundamental changes to how we run our Company.","And while external conditions in 2019 are impacting overall results, the benefits we're seeing from readiness are real. And more importantly, they are long lasting. These changes will make ADM better for the long run.","I'll discuss Readiness more later. Now, Ray will take us through our business performance. Ray?","Ray Young","Please turn to Slide number 5, beginning this quarter, we are simplifying the financial information that I will be speaking to, on our calls. However, all the data we have included in the past will be included in the appendix of our quarterly slide deck. As Juan mentioned adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.77, down from the $0.92 per share in the prior year quarter.","Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $764 million down 11%. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 6.5% slightly below our 2019 WACC of 6.75%. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was approximately 19% in line with the range of guidance we provided last quarter.","For the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 20%, which was our initial guidance. We generated about $1.7 billion of cash from operations before working capital in the first nine months of the year, slightly lower than the prior year period. Return of capital for the first nine months was about $740 million, including about $150 million in opportunistic share repurchases throughout the year to offset dilution.","We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 30% up from the 27% in the year ago quarter and continuing to improve from the first quarter high relate to the acquisition of Neovia. Capital spending for the year is forecast to be around $850 million in line with our previous guidance of $800 million to $900 million.","Turning to Slide 6, other business results were $47 million, significantly above the prior-year period, largely due to favorable underwriting results in captive insurance. Revised full year estimate for other will be in the $70 million to $80 million range, lower than the $80 million to $90 million. We previously guided, largely due to lower expected underwriting performance in the fourth quarter.","In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $139 million were down versus the prior-year period, principally due to lower accruals for performance-related compensation and the benefits of our restructuring earlier this year. Partially offset by higher spending in IT, as part of our business process transformation investment and by Readiness-related cost.","As a result we're expecting full year unallocated corporate cost to be in a range of $625 million to $650 million, significantly below the $700 million initial guidance we previously communicated. Net interest expense for the quarter was similar to last year's quarter. We continue to expect full year interest expense on a segment presentation basis to be in the range of $350 million to $375 million, down from our initial guidance of $400 million.","Corporate results also include non-cash early retirement charges and global workforce restructuring charges of $47 million or $0.07 per share in the LIFO credit of $16 million or $0.02 per share. Next, I'll discuss our business segment performance for the quarter. Please turn to Slide number 7.","Our newly combined Ag Services and Oilseeds business reported results that were lower than the third quarter of 2018, but up over the second quarter of this year. Ag Services results were in line with the prior year quarter. In North America improved merchandising results, particularly from ownership positions in corn and soybeans help to offset a weak U.S. export environment.","South American results were higher as we capture better origination margin opportunities in Brazil compared to the previous year and export volumes from Argentina increased. Crush results were down year-over-year. Global crush margins have come down from the record high levels of last year, but our teams nevertheless delivered solid margins in North America and EMEA in the third quarter.","In South America, margins were pressured by higher input costs caused by continued Chinese demand for Brazilian soybeans. Overall, our global crush margins benefited from positive net timing effects of approximately $50 million during the third quarter. Refined products and other results were significantly higher than the third quarter of 2018, largely driven by significant improvements in our golden peanut and tree nuts business. Wilmar results were lower year-over-year.","Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Ag Services and Oilseeds results to be substantially lower year-over-year, though performance should be stronger than the third quarter of this year with Ag Services expected to be sequentially better and crushing expected to be sequentially down.","Slide 8 please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were substantially lower than the year-ago period. Starches and Sweetener results were down versus the third quarter of 2018. In North America, higher net corn costs, pressured margins, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs including the benefits of our work to improve the reliability of our Decatur corn complex.","Starch volumes remained steady. In EMEA continued challenging market conditions including pressure from Turkish sweetener quotas and lower liquid sweetener prices impacting Central and Eastern European operations led to low results for the year. In wheat milling, an increase in sales volume was more than offset by lower margins due to limited opportunities in wheat procurement. Bioproducts results were significantly lower driven by high industry inventories and higher net corn costs in North America, leading to a challenged industry margin environment. Ethanol margin conditions remain negatively impacted by the lack of Chinese purchases from the U.S. and by the small refinery exemptions.","Looking ahead with typical seasonal reductions in sales volumes for sweeteners and for ethanol, as well as the continued difficult conditions for the ethanol business, we expect fourth quarter results in Carbohydrate Solutions to remain challenged, but with the continued benefits of our improvements at the Decatur complex we expect fourth quarter results to be sequentially similar to the quarter just ended.","On to Slide number 9. Nutrition results were substantially higher with operating profits approaching double the year ago quarter. WFSI results were significantly higher than prior-year quarter, with growth across the portfolio. Wild Flavors delivered its strongest quarterly profit ever. Sales were up 16% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Organic sales, excluding acquisitions were up 7%.","In Specialty Ingredients, the protein business continue to expand powered by our leadership position in supplying solutions to meet growing customer demand for alternative proteins. Continued contributions from our growth investments in bioactives and fibers support higher results in the Health & Wellness business.","Animal nutrition results were up substantially year-over-year as our Neovia acquisition continues to contribute. Vitamin additives were another strong performer, particularly coming off the year ago period when margins were significantly compressed. Lysine production is showing improvement, though market pricing has been negatively impacted by the lower global demand due to the effects of the African swine fever in Asia.","With a robust pipeline of new opportunities and continued benefits from investments we expect nutrition's growth story to continue in the fourth quarter, with results once again approaching double the prior year fourth quarter profit of $62 million.","WFSI should continue to benefit from increasing sales in flavors and alternative proteins solutions. Neovia will contribute to improve animal nutrition results. The results will be impacted by the Lysine production in the world markets. Juan?","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 10. As Ray explained market conditions in the third quarter remained challenging. Yet we delivered what we said we would, three months ago. We pull the levers that were under our control to turning a solid performance and I appreciate the team's good work.","We also continue to focus on the three key areas of our growth and returns algorithm. First, we improved underperforming businesses. Golden peanuts and tree nuts, our Decatur complex and Lysine production are all showing improved results, and we are now targeting December 1st for the launch of Vantage Corn Processors, our stand-alone ethanol subsidiary.","This is an important step as we continue to evaluate the strategic alternatives for our dry mills. Second, Readiness continues to spur our efforts to make ADM a more efficient, more innovative and more customer-focused company. We are seeing some truly exciting Readiness initiatives advance in the back half of this year.","For example, we've completed the pilot program in one of our Oilseeds processing facilities that utilize advanced analytics to deliver real time analysis and -- of production data, significantly increasing efficiency and quality. We're now rolling this technology out to more plans, leveraging the center of excellence structure we put into place for our global operations.","We've also piloted and are rolling out an innovative data mining and analytics package that will provide our merchandising and sales teams with an important new tool set to better capture market opportunities. We're also seeing good progress and results from the third pillar of our algorithm, harvesting our growth investments.","Back at the beginning of the year, we said we expected 2019, to be a breakout year for Nutrition. For the first three quarters of 2019, our Nutrition business has delivered $316 million in adjusted operating profit, just shy of the total for all of 2018. Additionally, we are delivering on our synergy targets for our Neovia integration and that business is strongly contributing to our results.","And we're also seeing the benefits of growth in our core businesses, from our expanding stevedoring and destination marketing businesses to the development of new applications from our full portfolio of vegetable oils to our increasing capabilities in food grade and industrial starches.","We are making good progress, however, while we believe our results this quarter were solid in the context of the external headwinds we face. Our team nevertheless is not satisfied. There is still more we can and will do to reach our returns objectives.","Looking ahead, we expect some external headwinds to continue in the foreseeable future. Conditions are fluid, however external conditions, good or bad, do not change our fundamental plan. We will remain focused on taking actions under our control to improve our near term results.","And we will continue to advance our strategic objectives including driving growth from the major global trends I discussed earlier. We remain confident that our strategy combined with our continued disciplined capital allocation, position us well for stronger results in 2020 and beyond.","With that, Jack, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson","So, my first question is, Ray's comments on fourth quarter Ag Services. It's -- obviously we don't know your ownership position to net debt segment was actually quite a bit stronger than I had thought for the quarter. So when you look at kind of the difficult harvest maybe farmers holding pretty tight to new crop, if you're limiting some of your merchandising opportunities, how does the fourth quarter -- how does all that play into your outlook for the fourth quarter?","Ray Young","Yes, I mean, I think you're right. I mean, the general export environment remains somewhat challenge for the entire U.S. agricultural industry, but sequentially we're having a later harvest this year. So we will be procuring. I mean we have procured a lot. We will continue to procure. We will be exporting of all of the two markets outside of China.","The other thing to note is that, with the wet harvest that we're having. We are anticipating to gain some significant drawing revenue as well within our business. And then also just want to remind people that, our Ag Services division really has diversified significantly. And so when you take a look at some of the other businesses such as the stevedoring business such as the global trade business, such as the destination marketing business, every year those businesses represent a greater contribution to our overall results within Ag Services.","So, as I indicated in the call. I mean, we do believe on a sequential basis, Ag Services will be stronger in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","Eric Larson","Okay. On a year-over-year -- on a year-over-year basis, will you expect it to be flat, down, up sequentially, obviously a little bit better than Q3, but how might that compare with Q4, a year ago?","Ray Young","Yes. Versus last year, but probably be similar to slightly better directionally in that area, just speaking of what we're seeing here.","Eric Larson","Okay. So, and then the combination of crush, your crushing results and Wilmar, I would assume that Wilmar is facing some pretty tough comps in Q4. So, I would assume that, that was probably going to be down year-over-year as well, would that be a fair observation.","Ray Young","Well, we said on crush again -- so crush will be -- compared to the third quarter, crush, we expect to be sequentially down in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter. Again a lot of it will be a function crush margins kind of evolve, right, in the fourth quarter. On the case of Wilmar, I mean, Wilmar will be announced in earnings in a couple of weeks. So I think you'll have a better perspective in terms of what it means for our fourth quarter after Wilmar announces its results there.","Operator","Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Your line is open.","Ben Bienvenu","I wanted to ask a question as it relates to Argentina, given the political change there and the prospect for a potential return to elevated export taxes. Is it possible that dynamic, that constrict the exports of Oilseeds derivative products out of Argentina? So that could be a net positive for your overall crushing margins operations. I know you don't have Argentina exposure, but just curious to hear your thoughts there. And then also kind of just opposing that with potentially weaker meal demand at Philippines and Vietnam as a result of the ASF in the near term would be helpful. Thanks.","Juan Luciano","Yes, Ben, so Argentina change governments and of course part of these government in their previous experience has got some export taxes for the country. The country faces significant pace of their debt going forward. So of course, the economic situation is to be consolidated. And obviously the Ag industry is one of the biggest revenue producers of Argentina.","So, the possibilities there, we don't know yet, December 10th is when they take power. I will say at this point in time, what's happening in Argentina is crush is down, because basically the farmer given the results of the elections are holding to their grain. So in that sense, we see lower crush which is always helpful for profitability in Europe, I will say when crush from Argentina is low. So whether that's going to happen next year or not, and to what degree. I think we will have to wait until December 10th.","Your second question was on soybean meal demand. We actually continued to see strength outside China were forecast outside China, soybean meal growth is about 3%. And although there are a lot of headlines about ASF may be expanding into Southeast Asia, we need to be mindful of the relative size of the market, like Vietnam, versus a market like China. So I think that still the discussion is about China, that is what the gap in protein is.","And I will say, if you look at China and with the information we can get it feels to me that the decline in the herd has peaked or bottomed, whatever your perspective is on that. And I think that the incentives at big high prices are given and the producers are having record profits right now in China. They are starting to think about how to rebuild the herd. A lot of them have shifted. About a third of them have shifted into poultry production. That has softened a little bit decline in soybean meal, because obviously you need to feed them.","And a lot of people are looking at more sophisticated meals, because the whole production is being more professionalized and standards are rising. So I think that people are looking for higher quality feed producers and high quality feed of which soybean meal is inclusive in that. There is also these big prices that we have for pork, big pork inflation has created the incentives to increase weight before slaughtering. So we're seeing higher feed on animals as well. So I think in general, we continue to be positive about soybean meal demand going forward. We don't see a significant decline.","Of course, I would say, we will have the balance that rebuild of the herd in China and all these things in China are going to be positive to demand, expansion in Southeast Asia is negative to demand. But I think given the magnitude of those, we are not that concerned about the expansion in South East Asia.","Ben Bienvenu","Okay, very helpful. My second question relates to the ethanol business. You mentioned the formation of the subsidiary, curious around current improvement that we've seen in stocks, production levels kind of dipped in mid-September, they've been steadily climbing back. We have a lot of idled capacity in the U.S. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts around what you think about sustainability of improved performance in the near term and then just your outlook to the extent that you can offer one in the intermediate term.","Ray Young","Yes, I think, a couple of things. As Juan indicated, we are setting up the stand-alone ethanol subsidiary as of December 1. Just for context, starting January 1, we will report Vantage Corn Processors as a separate sub-segment within carbohydrate solution. So clearly we're in the process of making sure transactions are occurring between the new subsidiary with ADM. And so we're well on our way. And the good news is we've got quite a few interested parties that we're talking to right now at the initial stages about some form of sale joint venture or other type of structure transactions. So we're along the -- well along our way there in terms of our strategic alternatives.","You're correct. There has been idling of facilities, idling of production in United States with respect to ethanol, I think the ethanol margin environment this year clearly has been extremely challenging and there's real production levels have come down. And that's frankly resulted in ethanol margins in the industry improving in the month of September, after Labor Day, which by the way it's unusual because normally after Labor Day you actually see ethanol margins deteriorate.","And so there has been some rebalancing of supply and demand. You point out, there is probably been an increase, a little bit of an increase in terms of production recently. We have to watch that carefully. I think what we've learned here, frankly is that when you get supply and demand a little bit more balanced, margins do improve in our industry here. And so we're looking at that very, very carefully. I think it is also important to note here in getting back to ethanol in terms of what ultimately will drive the ethanol margins higher is that we do need to drive incremental demand here.","And I think the discussions right now and the U.S. trying to trade regarding ethanol are important, as a additional catalyst in terms of driving incremental demand for ethanol, which by the way, when we buy ethanol we've actually buying corn from United States. And so that's -- for the U.S. agricultural industry, this is actually a very important part of the discussions here.","We also have the special refinery exemptions. We've had -- clearly have had some negative impact in 2019, but again there's further discussions in terms of that as we go forward. So I think that when you take a look at 2020. You asked the question. Can it get worse than what we've seen in 2019? It's actually very difficult to see a scenario by the industry ethanol margins in 2020 being worse than 2019, because it's been tough in 2019. I'm somewhat encouraged to seeing, idling a facility. So there seems to be a little bit more discipline within the industry right now, in terms of just trying to better match supply and demand.","But again, I do believe that it is important that the U.S. ethanol industry is strong, because that results in basically the U.S. agricultural industry being strong. And so therefore, we remain optimistic that we'll get toward some solution that will drive incremental demand and hence stronger ethanol margins in the future for our industry here.","Operator","Tom Simonich with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tom Simonich","So, just following up on ethanol, could you give us your expectations for U.S. ethanol exports in 2020 with and without China?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I mean I think that 2020 scenario excluding China will be very similar to this year, which is approximately 1.5 billion gallons. I think if you include China, again a lot of it to be a function of when you get toward a trade deal and how that is phased in. We've always talked about the fact that China if they move toward an E10 national villain for the country based upon our calculations, they could easily by 1 billion gallons from United States.","I mean, because the deficit is fairly significant in terms of China production relative to their overall demand. Now what number ultimately we'll get toward in terms of a trade negotiation. That's to be determined, based upon -- I suspect a phase in terms of a gallonage over time here. So again, we've always thought that the potential could be up to 1 billion gallons down the road here.","Tom Simonich","Okay. And on U.S. corn exports, volumes are down 60% in 2019, '20 marketing year-to-date. When do you expect competition to ease at current exchange rates? In the USDA projects, U.S. corn exports down 8% in this marketing year and clearly there is still a long way to go, but how realistic is that projection?","Ray Young","Well, I think that is true. Right now, U.S. corn is not that competitive relative to say, South America, I mean, we do expect that eventually U.S. corn will become competitive. Our thinking is when we get into the first quarter, it's probably a good period whereby at that juncture U.S. farmers will be looking probably to sell more of the corn, because as they start thinking about freeing up space and for next year.","So I think our assumptions right now in the fourth quarter, U.S. exports in general will be all the challenge. And that's reflected in my guidance commentary here. Getting the first quarter, you believe U.S. corn will become more competitive, so that'll probably be more movements of U.S. corn. I think the fact that you're not seeing that much pool of U.S. corn in the fourth quarter. It actually is a benefit for the processors like us because there is frankly a plentiful of U.S. corn for us to actually pull in order to put into our corn processing plants. And so, from a processing business that's a benefit for us.","Juan Luciano","Then also -- Tom also don't forget with these competitiveness over Brazil, we are exhausting the inventories in Brazil and due to the dryness, soybean was a little bit late in being planted that may make -- suffering been a little bit late as well. That may extend the window for the U.S. to be competitive when Ray mentioned in Q1. So that's another possibility there.","Operator","Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research Group. Your line is open.","Juan Luciano","Good morning, Heather.","Ray Young","Good morning, Heather.","Operator","Heather Jones, you line is open.","Juan Luciano","We can't hear you, Heather.","Operator","Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Yes, good morning. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper as we sort of think about the crushing environment in the U.S., I know previously you had said that potentially we could see something close to $1 margins, I guess on the board crush on the basis that if China has taken less soybean. If there is a lack of a trade agreement, I mean how do you see the market evolving, given that the U.S. pork production numbers are up and the chicken production numbers are up and yet the crush margins have been on the board at least a little bit weaker.","Juan Luciano","Yes, Michael, thank you for the question. Listen, we believe in the fundamentals of the crush margins business going forward. Of course, the market right now is trying to digest a lot of significant changes, whether it is Chinese soybean buying patterns and the U.S., the size of the U.S. crop. Some of the timing of the ASF impact that we will eventually see here. So I would say we've seen a decline in crush margins over the Q3, but we also see in that when crush margins decline, the industry react, because demand continues to be, as I said before about 3% and fundamentally sound. So we've seen already crush in Argentina taken down a little bit.","We've seen some of the plants that are dedicated to export in Brazil, taking some of that capacity there. We've seen some shift in Europe also from soybean to rate, just because there is more profitability there. So I think that we see the industry adjusting. In the U.S., we continue to see our customers announcing production increases going forward, and if you think about what happened over the last two weeks, we've seen a recovery in crush margins of about $0.15 per bushel. So they are kind of climbing back to maybe the five year average. So again, I think that we knew that it could be a short term blip when China accounts for sporadic purchases of U.S. soybeans.","But the fundamentals are there. And we think all these blips are temporarily best. So we feel good about our Q4. We came into Q4 with a reasonable hedge book for crush. We also have some positions into Q1. So we have visibility into what's happening, and we are fundamentally believers in the crush environment for 2020, given 3% growth, outside China.","Michael Piken","Terrific. And then just shifting gears, I know I've asked this question before. But on the Readiness initiatives, do you have any more clarity on where we might see the accrued savings, which segments, like little bit of a breakdown in -- is Nutrition getting any of it or, currently how for it would be..","Juan Luciano","Yes, no, I will say, Michael, Readiness come in several buckets as I was describing earlier. But I will say, given that a lot of those savings are coming from operations, the big businesses that own the big assets is where you see most of the benefits. So you're going to see it in corn, you're going to see it in Oilseeds and Ag Services.","I would say Nutrition earnings are driven mostly from growth and the impact that our value propositions have some customers and those applications. So we are outperforming market rates and we continue to grow our EBITDA margin on sales on that and that's not readiness related. They are improving with Readiness because the whole company is get invested and executing. But it's mostly the success of our value proposition. I would say most of the Readiness efforts, you're going to see them in either corporate or corn and Oilseeds and Ag Services.","Operator","Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Steven Haynes","Hi, this is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Just so maybe a quick question on CapEx since you mentioned that you found some more opportunity to optimize capital allocation, kind of what's the go-forward run rate for CapEx, as we think about 2020?","Juan Luciano","Yes. When we look at 2020, we're still going through the plan, but it will be in the range of maybe $800 million. So if you think about it -- that's why we've been trickling down to those levels from the $1 billion level. Depreciation and amortization, given Neovia these days is about $1 billion. So it will be a little bit under that. And we feel comfortable. We said it before that our five year plan doesn't have anything spectacular, put there is mostly harvesting plan.","So you will see our CapEx in that range and it may fluctuate that we do things like one ADM and all that, but it will not fluctuate more than just $50 million or $100 million up or down depending on the year, but putting something in the range of $800 million to $850 million is reasonable going forward for us for the few years ahead of us.","Steven Haynes","Okay. And then if I could just squeeze in a follow-up, any updates on the house to you, in terms of U.S. production and maybe some early thoughts on what's going on the Southern hemisphere.","Juan Luciano","The production of what, sorry, I couldn't hear a word.","Steven Haynes","Just U.S. corn production, U.S. soybean productions and then just kind of the house view.","Juan Luciano","Yes, well, the crop is late and now harvest started and then wet conditions make it stop. And I would say the farmer right now is shifting more to harvest in the beans, and they may come back to corn later. There has been rumors in South America about weather. I will say it has rained in Argentina recently that has benefited the crops. So I wouldn't put lot of issuing to Argentine weather. Brazil, we're talking about dryness, but I live three years in Brazil, Brazil is a tropical country, it always rains. So it will catch up with that. So I would say, I wouldn't put a lot of weather into South America yet.","South America, weather is more important into January, February, we will. I guess here, I think the farmer will deal with this weather and will harvest the crop -- whether the crop initial results in terms of yield, you have your favorite numbers out there, may be coming a little bit softer in terms of yield that may be initially expected but too early to tell probably, Steve.","Operator","Vincent Anderson with Stifel. Your line is open.","Vincent Anderson","Yes. Thank you. I appreciate your earlier commentary on African swine fever, but I was hoping you could talk about maybe what has surprised you the most in terms of how the situation has played out over the course of 2019, and how you're positioning yourself now and specifically, have you continue to see feed mills closing in China, given the somewhat more sustained demand that we've seen in feed than maybe we initially expected.","Juan Luciano","Yes, Vincent. I would say the thing that surprises the most probably is, maybe we -- without the acceleration of growth of production outside China was going to be faster its taking some of these countries, whether it is Brazil and all that, a little bit of time to grow their chickens and all that. So I would say, we didn't see right now the extra impact you now we're crushing compounds about that extra demand that we are expecting. We think we're going to see that in 2020, but it didn't happen in the second half of the year.","I still maintain, what I said in the second quarter of our earnings call that second half for us will be stronger than first half. And we have line of sight on that and I can say that with confidence. So that hasn't changed. I would say in China, we see this structural shift into more professionally driven farms and productions.","That as I said, is going to be a positive for us. We have not shut down any of our plans, and we are planning to, because we think that sophisticated feed rations and sophisticated feed producers like us will be seek to help the industry getting out of these. China will have to produce again and certainly we will not do it in the same conditions that they've done it today because that had broaden ASF.","So we feel there is a lot of work to do and we're working closely with our Chinese counterparts in that. I would say outside China, I think that given the conditions are different, although the disease has spread. I think that the ability to discount is to control the disease is better than what China has. So, the disease can impact your country and you're going to still continue to produce and continue to be an export that we have seen it with Europe for many years. So we are a little bit more positive about that.","And as I said at the beginning is that there is magnitude between what happened in South East Asia versus the amount of pork that is produced in China. It makes it just a China discussion at least from my perspective.","Vincent Anderson","Great, thank you. And just staying on the topic of ASF we've read studies showing that the virus has a pretty decent half-life and contaminated feed, how exposed is your global feed network right now to potentially being part of the viruses spread. Are you situated now in any countries with ASF in terms of your feed production assets or are those assets really only moving feed, between other infected areas?","Juan Luciano","Yes, that's a very good question, because we need to be very vigilant. So it makes for that nobody contributes to the spread of this disease. We see the spreads, because people move either pork, people move food around countries. I would say in the feed side, I mean we have extreme care in making sure as I said that feed doesn't grow into areas where, from areas with disease to areas without the disease, and without the proper care. So I would say we have extreme measures on that. As we have a extreme measures on everything we touch, I mean we are a food company, so quality and preservation of the value chain and value integrity, if you will, is paramount to us. So very much on top of our agenda.","Vincent Anderson","Thanks. And actually if I could sneak in just a real quick follow-up, how strong would you say your feed mitigant portfolio is right now and is that a place you see yourself making incremental investment if a vaccine is truly years off, like some experts are saying.","Juan Luciano","We expect our feed business is part of our growth in the Nutrition division. Of course, so you saw our investment in Neovia, significantly expanding our footprint in Asia. So we have very big prospects for that. And we understand, as you're pointing it out at the ASF will be a multi-year impact in the industry. So we think we're going to have to work together with our Chinese counterparts to bring new technologies and more sophisticated feeds and systems into the country and we are ready to do so.","Operator","Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thanks. I wanted to do a little checking on the Neovia acquisition. And just a math here like you paid $3 billion for WILD, and it looks like the returns are good on that acquisition. It's $360 million of operating profit or so, but Neovia you paid $1.8 billion. It looks like maybe $30 million of operating income per year right now. I think when you bought it, it was earning over $100 million. Can you please correct me if my math is wrong and if not maybe tell us again, is there, has there been a step backward on this business in year one after the acquisition?","Ray Young","I think, Rob, I think that when you look at soybean, Nutrition line, you could be careful because, lysine, as Juan indicated, which is part of the animal nutrition line, it's actually suffering from the impact of excess lysine, the world due to ASF. And so there is a negative number in the animal nutrition line which kind of mass -- kind of the benefits of Neovia.","So when we look at Neovia relative to our deal model, it's basically in line with our deal model in the first year. Again we closed one month later. We also had some adjustments due to inventory, due to PPA, but you take that out of the consideration. It's in line with their deal model right now. And so when we look out into the future, especially given that the cost synergies are coming in a lot faster than what we thought. We feel good about the acquisition in terms of the context of our financial objectives including return objectives right now.","Robert Moskow","Where your return objectives more stringent on Neovia or more liberal than for WILD?","Ray Young","They're consistent. I mean, we always said that's important on the strategic acquisitions that by the time we get to year three that we're earning in excess of our cost of capital.","Operator","Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","Good morning. I was hoping you guys could comment a little bit on the outlook in starches and sweeteners. And just maybe any thoughts on how the contracting season is progressing and more broadly, the impact of some of the dislocations in corn basis, co-products and late harvest and how that's impacting kind of the business and how you think about some of the improvement from your own operations that you should be having going into 2020.","Juan Luciano","So, a lot to wrap up in the question. So I would say, let's start with the contracting season, I mean is going as expected. I think there is no, I mean, I think everybody wants to see what's happening with corn and how the planting goes. So it may be a little bit more, may be a little slower than other years, but is progressing along and is ongoing, so we normally comment as you know in our next earnings call. So when we talk at the end of January or February on this and the results of that is going OK.","I would say this quarter, it was a tough quarter for carbohydrate solutions in general. You saw that we have higher corn costs, higher corn costs than normally by this time of the year we will see a little bit more of a break -- given the harvest. And this year we see maybe a little bit better or may be basis break in a little bit more on the West than then maybe in East.","I would say the biggest drivers this quarter of the shortfall, if you will have been higher corn cost, which were offset a little bit by better manufacturing costs, given the improvements that we then indicated, but not completely. And then some issues that we have in Europe, we have a business in Europe that has been affected by the Turkey sweeteners quota. And that's probably something that maybe you didn't have that much visibility as you look at the numbers from the outside.","I think from a volumes perspective, volumes have evolved as expected I would say, sweeteners, remain consistent with what we've been communicated in which year-to-date, they are down less than 2%. When we look at starches, this is a better story and starches story is, our volumes were basically flat, because we are out of capacity, but we've been able to play with the product mix and shift time of that to the higher value margins. And so, we have expanded margins and of course, of our announcement of the repurposing of Marshall. So, to be able to shift some of our 42 capacity into starches, just because of the growth that, and the opportunities we seen in that, especially in the food area.","So all in all, we continue to be positive about this business. Sweeteners and starches or starches and sweetener is a very solid type of business and we get good returns here. So we are positive about it.","Ray Young","Adam, just to give a perspective, I know like on a quarter-to-quarter basis were down $38 million in starches and sweeteners compared to last year, but it's important get to context. I mean, milling last year we had some very strong procurement gains. This year, we have smaller procurement gains. And so the milling divisions were down about $10 million. And then on the corn starches and sweeteners, the majority of the other variance actually relate to European operations as Juan indicated. We're down in North America a bit due to just higher net corn costs.","But the majority of the variance is really attributable to more of the EMEA operations, which is again a lot of this deal in the Turkish quota situation, is just due to the European sugar prices, which by the way is starting to recover right now, so there is a lot of transitory issues that are in Europe, which are going to pass here.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That color is really helpful. And then just second for me. Last quarter you had kind of talked about give or take $500 million of operating earnings improvement potential in 2020 from the readiness initiatives and normalizing of production at the Decatur and the absence of just the absence of some of the flooding in the North American weather, the spring, does that guidance or that view still hold, that opportunity still in front of you.","Juan Luciano","Yes, I think Adam we like to present it that way because those are things under our control. And those are not forecast, but actually plans that our actions behind those things. So we continue our -- and probably with the exception of the weather that we hope that is not going to be as exceptional as it was this year. But part of that is to continue to fix the leakages of the issue that we have indicator on lysine that we work, we are finalizing that, but we're not going to have those issues in the 2020.","We're going to have the full run rate of some of the organizational changes we have this year and we are controlling that pretty tightly. So it's going to happen. As I described before, I think Readiness, we're going to have another $600 million of run rate increments. And we have those, we have the process, so we don't need to invent anything. We just need to move the project along. And then we have all the incremental harvesting from M&A and the growth and you saw the results of Nutrition this quarter.","And you're going to see similar jumps in Nutrition as we go forward, we look at Q4 even Q4 for Nutrition, we think the possibility of also about doubling the results of Q4 last year. So when you have almost two consecutive quarters of doubling. You can think of what is the potential for next year. So we feel very good about that number of maybe $500 million to $600 million improvements that are under our control come into the P&L next year.","Operator","Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research Group. Your line is open.","Juan Luciano","Heather?","Heather Jones","Hi.","Ray Young","Hi, Heather.","Heather Jones","Sorry about that, I had to go back and forth, between two calls at a time.","Juan Luciano","No problem.","Heather Jones","I know we're near the end. So I'll try to make this quick and I apologize if somebody has already asked you this. But you mentioned higher corn costs for the starches and sweeteners business, but was just wondering if you could give us any early color you have about, how you think basis is going to be trending for next year, given the late harvest and continued weather issues and all, like what are your thoughts on basis for next year?","Ray Young","Yes, I mean basis as Juan commented, basis is actually fairly high. I mean, particularly on the East Coast, the eastern part of United States, the western side has come off a little bit but again on a -- when you look at it from a seasonal perspective, we've got extremely high basis compared to historical norms. Our -- I mentioned that part of the reason why our third quarter and North American sweetener results were slightly down versus last year is just due to the fact that we had higher net corn costs, we normally hedge a lot of it, but there is a certain portion we don't hedge. And so for the unhedged portion we incurred some higher costs.","As we kind of look forward, we do believe at some juncture, corn will get commercialized. I mean the crop is out there, it's a late harvest. I mean remember only 41% of the U.S. corn has been harvested right now versus five year average of 60%. So it is the late harvest, but some juncture that the harvest will occur, there will be accumulation. And at some juncture there'll be commercialization, especially as U.S. corn becomes more competitive in the world markets. And so the timing of when basis will break. Is it going to be, latter part of the fourth quarter? Is it going to be the first quarter? To be determined, at some juncture we do believe that there will be a break in the basis here. And that will benefit the originators like us.","Heather Jones","And my final question is just ASF and one of the times when I was on the call I heard Juan mentioning that there, given the margins in China and all there is some producers that are trying to expand. And I was just wondering if you could add further color on that. Because like Vietnam, continues to have recurrent breaks China is having recurrent breaks. So it's like wondering if you could qualify the magnitude you're seeing there.","And then secondly if you could give further color on when you expect the benefit to show, and 2020 because of the trade issues, the impact on U.S. producers has been delayed and like do you expect that expansion start in early '20 or do you think that's going to happen more in late '20 and just if you could give us some more details on that.","Juan Luciano","So difficult to speculate in all these -- but I would say, given the information we have on the ground in China, we do know that producers are increasing the weight of the peaks before slaughtering. We do know that -- we certainly know we have data from our team that about one-third of the producers have shifted to poultry production given the opportunity there.","And we do know that the incentive, that price is providing to some of these producers, especially for the more industrial ones, they are starting to rebuild the herd. Those were, they ones that were preserved the most, if you will, and less impacted and they have better sanitary conditions. Very difficult for me to put any numbers beyond these Heather in terms of what, what we know, because it's a large country with many operations like this.","In terms of the impact to us, I would say we're going to see the impact in 2020. We're starting to see the impact in Brazil or in Europe. I think the impact on the U.S., I mean, you see our customers haven't getting ready whether is getting rid of -- I mean or getting ready to export, it will depend on what's happened with the 62% tariff that China is imposing to that, if they want to get rid of with that, if they want to issue a tariff exemption, or is there is, this is part of the Phase 1 deal, we will have to see, it's difficult to handicap.","I would say we will see it in Europe and South America certainly started on the first half, whether we see in North America will depend on the geopolitics of all these which I want handicap at this point.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ken Zaslow","Good morning. I know there's been a lot of questions asked about this, but just, is there a way to just frame how much the delayed harvest has actually impeded your profit in 2019?","Ray Young","I guess that's a complicated -- complicated question.","Ken Zaslow","I know, and someone have.","Ray Young","There is just other factor, right. Impact is whole, it's not just a supply issue, in terms of us procuring the crop. It is also demand since the China is not really aggressively in the market here. So it's a complicated issue, to say that just because of a delayed harvest, it has this much impact. I do think that, Ken, the way we kind of think about it is that eventually the harvest will occur, eventually we're going to be procuring all the products, eventually United States is going to be competitive in corn and soybeans. And so, eventually we will be moving the crop out to the world markets here.","Juan Luciano","I think, Ken, the way I tend to think about it is sometimes is not that much the volume or the delay in the harvest is, what that does to the farmers market in beef pattern, if you will. And I think what it does today, since they don't know the size they're holding to the grain. And that's where the impact comes, that's where we're having high basis today when we should -- basis should break more at the harvest, but the farmer doesn't know with 40% and at this time of the year being late, what kind of crop he has.","So I think as Ray said at the end, we're going to have a big crop. There are big inventories, all that will be moved to the market. We will move that. We will try a lot of that, because it's going to be with an early, but I think the main issue is how all these things, whether it is China trade or whether it is the delay impacts farmer commercialization. That's probably the biggest disrupt for us. And today you see it in our, in some of the impact, we are getting in basis in the U.S.","Ken Zaslow","Okay, but you do you think that over time, I mean it is profit but between the China trade deal as well as delayed harvest that you will regain somewhere in 2020 or 2021 that will come fully back to you that 2019 will be kind of aberrational in terms of the profit level. Is that a fair assessment?","Juan Luciano","It depends some -- so some will come back, because we will commercialize that and we have the assets to do that. So we will go through our assets. Some also will depend on the timing, because part of our previous years, Ag Services, great Q4s, remember counted on both having an export, simultaneous strong soy and corn export programs out of the goal. That's what made elevation margins pulp. So part of that will depend on that dynamics and we will have to see it in the Q4 of 2020 if you will.","But in the meantime, I think that our team has done well, look at this quarter. This quarter results product services given the lack of export volumes for corn, we're very significant. So I'm proud of how the team has been playing it. And I think the river getting back into navigation and normal rates has helped a lot that at the beginning of the year for the first half was almost impossible demand. So I think the team has done an outstanding job and ensure they will do the same in 2020.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Victoria de la Huerga for her closing remarks.","Victoria de la Huerga","Thank you for joining us today.

This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.92, up from $0.45 in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $861 million, up nearly 60% year-over-year. And our fourth quarter trailing ROIC of 8.3% is more than 200 basis points above our annual WACC.","Our team continued to capitalize on robust global demand with good execution and great utilization of our global footprint. And while delivering another strong quarter, the team also did a great job advancing our strategic plan, executed on key growth projects and accelerating our Readiness efforts as we build the foundation to take our performance even higher.","Looking back on some of key accomplishments, in optimizing the core, our South American origination team manages risk positions well, including the Brazilian freight situation, and is up substantially year-to-date over 2017. We continued to optimize our North American origination footprint, monetize our investment in Agrible, and as mentioned last quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Bolivian oilseeds business during the quarter.","In our efforts to drive efficiencies, our operational excellence initiatives have delivered cost savings of more than $200 million on a run rate basis over the first three quarters of the year, already meeting our full year 2018 target. We will, of course, continue those efforts.","In strategic expansion, our Origination business is making important investments in digital and innovation capabilities with our just announced GrainBridge joint venture and our work with other industry players to modernize the global agricultural value chain. In Oilseeds, we announced that we are acquiring certain assets of Algar Agro, particularly two crush, refining and packaging facilities in Brazil, which will further strengthen our processing presence in that important region.","Our Carbohydrates Solution business is working to add industrial starch capacity to several facilities to meet market demand, and we celebrated the opening of our modernized flour mill in Enid, Oklahoma, this quarter. And in Nutrition, we completed our acquisitions of Rodelle and Protexin. We'll close on the Neovia acquisition in coming months, and opened the latest in our series of high tech customer innovation centers in Shanghai.","We're also moving very quickly in advancing Readiness. Readiness is central to our strategic goals. It underpins and supports each of our pillars of our plan. We're excited about the progress we're making and the opportunities we are creating with Readiness. Around the globe, our colleagues are identifying, analyzing and now have begun executing on initiatives that are building a foundation for increasing earnings growth in the years to come. I'll be talking more about Readiness in our outlook later on this call.","Now I'll turn it over to Ray to talk about the quarter.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.92, up from the $0.45 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $861 million, up $321 million from the year-ago quarter. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC continued its upward trajectory reaching 8.3%, more than 200 basis points above our 2018 annual WACC. Thus, generating positive EVA of $546 million.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 15%, up slightly from the exceptionally low rate of 13% in the prior year. For the full year 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be closer to the lower end of the 16% to 18% range that we guided earlier in the year.","On chart 18, the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.92 per share. For this quarter, we had a $0.01 per share charge related to LIFO, a $0.40 per share credit related to gains on sales of investments, and a $0.01 per share charge related to discrete tax items.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. The Other segment results increase on stronger ADM Investor Services earnings due to higher short-term interest rates, and improved underwriting results from our captive insurance subsidiary. In the Corporate lines, net interest expense for the quarter increased due to higher short-term interest rates and higher borrowings.","Unallocated corporate costs of $161 million were up versus the prior year due to performance related compensation accruals and higher project spending on Information Technology and growth related projects.","Turning to our cash flow statement on slide 6. We generate $1.9 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first nine months of the year, an increase of more than 19%. Total capital spending in the first nine months was $555 million, in line with our expectation for the year. Acquisition spending amounted to $324 million, which includes our additions of Protexin and Rodelle.","We also returned $568 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Therefore, we continued our balanced approach to capital spending, acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30 for 2018 and 2017. Our balance sheet remains solid. Our operating working capital of $8 billion was up approximately $100 million versus the year-ago period. Total debt was about $7.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance of $6.9 billion.","We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%, in line with the year-ago quarter. Our shareholders equity of $19 billion is up from the $17.6 billion last year, primarily due to net earnings in excess of dividends and repurchases.","We had $6.8 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we had access to $7.7 billion of short-term liquidity.","One additional item to note. Last week we completed the transfer of about $0.5 billion of U.S. retiree liabilities to an insurance company which will cover the benefits of about 3,800 U.S. retirees starting in 2019. This represents an important part of our ongoing efforts to manage our U.S. pension plan risk. As a result of this transfer, we expect to take $110 million to $130 million pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter which will be an item for adjusted EPS purposes.","Next, I'll discuss our business segment performance for the quarter. Please turn to slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $861 million of adjusted operating profit, excluding specified items, up almost 60% from the $541 million in last year's third quarter.","Now I'll review the performance of each segment as well as some thoughts on the fourth quarter.","Starting on slide 9, Origination results were up substantially year-over-year with all businesses showing improvements. Merchandising and Handling was significantly higher versus the weak third quarter of 2017 as the team did a great job managing through a volatile price environment. In North America, we capitalized on our strong asset base to deliver higher volumes and margins including strong export sales, particularly of corn, to customers in markets outside of China.","In Global Trade, there was a similar story, as the team delivered stronger year-over-year results. The group did a great job to plan and execute through the droughts in Europe and Australia, utilizing our global network of origination assets and our expanding destination marketing capabilities to meet increasing demand for crops and products, particularly soybeans and meal in those regions.","Transportation results more than doubled year-over-year as the ARTCO team utilized its assets including the stevedoring capabilities we have invested in to capitalize on strong freight rates and export demand, and deliver higher volumes and margins.","Looking ahead for Origination, we expect North American operations to be pressured by lower elevation margins due to the lack of China demand, partially offset by export demand from the rest of the world, including from our destination marketing business.","Overall fourth quarter results are expected to be solid, but lower than Q4 2017 which included positive impacts from insurance settlements and other income. For the full year, we expect Origination results to be substantially higher than the prior year and exceeding our expectations at the beginning of 2018.","Now to slide 10. Oilseeds results were also up significantly over the prior year period as the business delivered another strong quarter. The Crushing and Origination team set a new overall record for global crush volumes. The team leveraged its strong global asset base and our growing destination marketing capabilities as robust global meal demand, the short crop in Argentina and the continuing U.S.-China trade situation combined to support higher crush margins.","Soybean crush was the major driver of earnings growth in the business with North America, EMEA and South America all delivering substantially higher results year-over-year. Softseed results had a significant improvement from the third quarter of 2017 with particularly good results in EMEA.","Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other was down versus the third quarter of 2017. Biodiesel was up substantially year-over-year and refined oils, including edible oils, continued to perform well. Peanut shelling margins were significantly lower as large peanut inventories amid difficult market conditions resulted in some inventory write-downs. Lastly, Asia was higher on strong Wilmar results.","Looking ahead to Q4, we expect very strong year-over-year growth as we continue to capitalize on a good global soy crush environment. Our PBL is expected to be in line with the prior year as global food and Biodiesel businesses should perform well. We expect continued softness in our peanut shelling business for the fourth quarter as we continue to take actions to improve results.","For the calendar year, we expect Oilseeds to continue to benefit from the many strategic actions the team has taken, from operations enhancements to growth initiatives to portfolio management and deliver excellent results, significantly higher both than the prior year and what we had anticipated earlier this year.","Slide 11, please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were slightly lower than the year-ago period. Starches and Sweeteners delivered solid results, slightly below the strong prior year period. We continue to see a solid North American market for liquid sweeteners and the group delivered good margins and volumes in the quarter, offset by higher input and manufacturing costs.","EMEA sweeteners continued to benefit from recent acquisitions, particularly our Chamtor facility in France, delivering good results despite sugar oversupply in the region that is pressuring sweetener prices. Flour milling was higher on strong weak procurement results and timing effects in both the U.S. and Canada.","Bioproducts results were down. The team did a good job managing risk in extremely weak ethanol industry margin environment. Beverage and industrial alcohols had improved results, benefiting from renewed focus after the reconfiguration of our Peoria dry mill. Our North American sweeteners and bioproducts results were also impacted by Decatur downtime issues as we continued to make improvements to the long-term reliability of the complex.","Looking ahead, we anticipate Carbohydrate Solutions to have lower results in the fourth quarter than in the comparable period last year with better results in Starches and Sweeteners offset by lower results in Bioproducts.","As we discussed last quarter, we will continue to have downtime in our Decatur complex for the rest of the year as we make important upgrades. We expect the underlying Starches and Sweeteners market to remain solid. The industrial starch market represents an increasingly important part of that product mix driven by growing needs for containerboard from e-commerce and we're expanding our starch production capacity to ensure we can capitalize on that growing opportunity.","For the full year, we expect results for the Carbohydrates Solutions business to be lower than 2017 driven by ethanol margins and Decatur downtime.","On slide 12, Nutrition was in line with the prior year period with a very strong quarter from WFSI, offset by weaker performance in lysine. We continue to see good performance across WFSI, with results significantly higher than the prior year period. The business delivered an impressive 10% year-over-year sales growth on a constant currency basis and profit growth of more than 30%.","WILD EMEA and North American results were substantially higher on portfolio mix and improved volumes, and we continued to add to our portfolio with the completion of our Rodelle acquisition.","In Specialty Ingredients, emulsifiers and proteins continued to perform well with strong year-over-year growth and the Health and Wellness business continued to grow with the addition of Protexin.","In Animal Nutrition, issues developed during the quarter that constrained lysine production volumes and increased manufacturing cost, contributing to lower year-over-year results. Changes in industry vitamin pricing also impacted premix margins.","For the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to see fundamental underlying strength in the Nutrition business. We anticipate continued strong sales growth from WFSI as customers and consumers continue to seek out healthy and functional ingredients. On the Animal Nutrition side, premix margin should return to normal levels and we'll see some residual lysine production issues.","Overall, Nutrition results for the fourth quarter should be modestly improved over Q4 of 2017. For calendar year 2018, Nutrition results should be substantially higher than the full year of 2017 providing strong momentum for continued growth.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to slide 13. As you heard, we are anticipating a strong year. Across the company, we are seeing our team perform well and we're realizing the benefits from our actions. Things are going well, but we can't stand still. We must keep getting better.","We have enormous potential and a great opportunity to build on our position of strength and take our performance to a new level through the increasing benefits from the strategic growth investments we have made, and through accelerating our Readiness efforts.","Turning first to growth. A major piece of the strategic plan we laid out in 2014 was expanding our portfolio into businesses that had strong growth potential and more stable earnings, and also growing our geographic footprint. We started by acquiring WILD Flavors in 2014 and combining it with the significant portfolio of Specialty Ingredients, our Corn and Oilseeds businesses already produced, to create WFSI providing an immediate global leadership position in the flavor and value-added ingredients space.","Our approach with WILD was first to enhance the profitability of the business, resulting in an impressive 20 plus percent compound annual growth rate in OP between 2015 and our 2018 projection. Then, we invested to expand the portfolio even further. We're building revenue synergies with bolt-on acquisitions like Eatem Foods, Harvest Innovations and Rodelle. We're expanding into the rapidly growing personalized nutrition space with Biopolis and Protexin and we are investing in state-of-the-art customer innovation centers in the U.S., Singapore, Australia and China.","Today, we are seeing the results of that strategic approach with top-line Q3 revenue growth in WFSI of 10% year-over-year, and 35% OP growth.","This same approach of first driving profitability improvements and then a strong revenue growth is the one we plan to replicate with Neovia at our Animal Nutrition business. We've delivered success and we're excited to do it again.","Importantly, even as we have expanded our portfolio, we have continued investing in our traditional businesses. Around the globe, we have expanded our footprint and capabilities from the construction of new plants like our Animal Nutrition facilities in China, or our new pea protein plant in Enderlin, South Dakota, to acquisitions like Eaststarch and Chamtor to joint ventures like Medsofts, Industries Centers, SoyVen and Aston.","Taken together, we have made more than $5 billion in growth investments since 2014. We have launched six new plants globally, purchased and integrated 17 companies, formed four new joint ventures, and added five new innovation centers and labs. We have also divested more than $2 billion in businesses and assets that were less strategic or were not going to achieve our returns objectives, including our cocoa and chocolate businesses.","We made many of our investments during times of strong industry headwinds while still returning more than $8 billion in capital to shareholders, executing our balanced capital allocation framework and maintaining our solid balance sheet.","And what really gives me confidence about the future is that while many of these strategic investments have already begun to deliver benefits and be accretive to our results, the full impact of some of the recent ones is still coming. And when you add soon to close deals like Neovia and Algar to that mix, you can see why we're confident that our investments will continue to add to growth in earnings in 2019 and beyond.","Next slide, please. Slide 14 shows how Readiness and our strategic plan fit together. Readiness supports each of our three strategic pillars. It's how we are going to take our execution of the plan to an even higher level. So starting next quarter, when we update on how we are advancing the plan, we'll also update on how we are advancing Readiness.","Let me give you some context first on the importance of Readiness. Over the past several years, we challenged each of our business units to be the very best in their respective industries and they did precisely that, setting the bar for performance which is one of the reasons for our success this year. Now, through Readiness, we are taking industry-leading practices backed by robust processes and using them across ADM, so we're not just divesting our individual industries, but the very best companies.","Readiness is not a cost-cutting program, and it's not just about operational efficiencies. It's about changing the way we work, and as a result, further unleashing our team to deliver revenue growth and margin improvement, more efficient and effective project execution, ongoing sustainable cost savings and industry-leading support to our customers. With Readiness, we're standardizing, centralizing, and digitizing how we do business on an enterprise-wide level and we're improving our execution capabilities across the company.","We've reached an exciting point in our Readiness efforts. We moved quickly through the first two phases of Readiness. We started with top-down diligence of the overall value potential, and then we asked colleagues to help plan and identify specific initiatives that would meet our goals. Now, we are moving into implementation. More than 2,000 employees across the company have identified more than 2,500 specific initiatives, and that number continues to grow.","The team has done a great job identifying ways that we can build on our success. We are centralizing more activities into global business centers, expanding manufacturing excellence across the enterprise, moving to the next level of key account management to provide faster service while delivering superior customer experience. And we're advancing and embracing digital technologies, like our recent announcements with other industry players. Some initiatives will take time to implement while others smaller initiatives are getting underway, opening opportunities for significant value creation and helping to support business that are facing headwinds in 2018.","To accelerate and sustain results, we are training all 31,000 of our colleagues around the world through a program called Ability to Execute, which will help guide fundamental behavioral change in how we do our work every day. As we move into the implementation phase of Readiness, we believe we will be able to generate more than $1 billion of run-rate benefits by the end of year two, or roughly double the rate of operational excellence improvements that we have been achieving over the past few years. In addition to run-rate benefits, some Readiness initiatives will also contribute towards one-time benefits in capital spending and working capital.","As I mentioned before, Readiness is about lasting, sustainable change. It is how we will do our work now so the benefits will continue to grow beyond year two. They will ramp up over time in conjunction with the cadence of execution. And some will be used to offset inflation and market factors, but a significant portion will fall to the bottom line.","It's an exciting time at ADM. Our team has shown it can pull the right levers to deliver strong growth and earnings, and they are fully engaged in taking ADM to the next level. Between growth and Readiness, and with the global demand outlook that remains robust, we expect 2019 to be an even stronger year for ADM.","With that, Jack, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Your line is open.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. This is actually Cornell Burnette in with a few questions for David.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Cornell.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","First question was just kind of going back to something that you said in the press release when you indicated that you expect good momentum to continue at the end of 2018 but also that you expect better earnings and returns in 2019. So I just wanted to be clear. Is that you guys basically expressing your confidence that, in 2019, we do have all of the pieces in place such that we can see EPS grow over what we've done this year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, Cornell, we do believe so. We believe clearly that 2019 we will \u2013 we can grow earnings versus 2018. Demand continues to be robust across our businesses, we have a lot of momentum in margins in some of our businesses, and we feel excited about both access of growth earnings that I described, the strategic growth that we have invested in over the last couple of years.","We have several acquisitions that we're going to have being accretive in 2019 that we didn't have in 2018. We have several projects coming into operations that we're going to have in 2019 that we didn't have in 2018. And we're going to have the benefit of Readiness that actually will start being accretive, as I described, with about $1 billion run rate savings by the end of year two, but they're going to be growing in 2019 as well.","The other issue that you shouldn't underestimate is in 2018, not everything went our way as well. We have issues in the Golden Peanut business that we haven't had in the past and we are planning to correct those issues for 2019. We have issues in \u2013 whether it's in Decatur reliability on lysine that are issues that we're going to put behind at the end of Q4.","So we're going to have several things that actually were headwinds in 2018 that will not be there in 2019. So between those things that we're going to fix, but the growth initiatives that are coming to be accretive in 2019 plus Readiness, we feel strongly about 2019 being better than 2018.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just a follow-up maybe on the oilseed crushing side. Just wondering what's your visibility into maybe kind of the crush market environment in the first half, particularly in first half of next year and is it safe for us to assume that you've been able to go in and lock in a good portion of your crushing in Qs 1 and maybe even in Qs 2?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, Cornell. I mean, normally in our hedging programs we would go out several quarters and so it's fair to say that we do have some portion of the early part of 2019 already hedged.","I think it's important to understand also like \u2013 you know, I know people are looking at crush margins, right now, they're bouncing around a little bit. It's actually quite volatile at this juncture. When we look outside into the future, we're actually seeing continued solid demand for soybean meal. I mean, global demand for soybean meal is probably going to be running at 4% to 4.5%.","And so I know there's a little bit of noise right now in terms of crush margins, a lot of it driven by the rumors regarding U.S. and China, but we always look at underlying supply demand and so from our perspective, we actually believe it's a very healthy demand environment for soybean meal. And also demand for oil remains robust, particularly on the biodiesel side. So we actually feel good about where crush margins are heading into future here. Will it be at the same average level of 2018? Maybe not, but it doesn't mean that's going to drop dramatically.","So we believe that we're in a period whereby crush margins, soy crush margins, are going to remain healthy. And then with what Juan mentioned in terms of all the different initiatives that we're driving in Oilseeds, particularly the acquisitions that we're doing, including Algar, the Readiness initiatives, the improvement in Brazil. I mean, the Brazilian freight situation clearly had an impact on a lot of the merchandisers in Brazil. That's going to get behind us at the end of the year. So we feel good about where Oilseeds is heading in 2019 and adds to, again, the confidence that Juan had expressed regarding year-over-year earnings growth.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then lastly, I guess on the softseed side, seemed like you made some comments that softseed crushing, the results kind of picked up and strengthened a bit in the quarter. So just wondering, kind of, what's driving maybe some of the improvement on the softseed side and is that an area where, in 2019, you think you could see better results?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I mean, clearly the short soybean crop in Argentina resulted in less meal heading into export markets, including over the year. So hence, our softseed crushing operations in Europe benefit from a combination of less supply out of South America, but also just good solid demand, particularly in the biodiesel side and so that contributed towards really some very healthy margins that we've seen in the European crush environment.","Cornell R. Burnette - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot. With that, I'll pass it along.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just wondering, maybe two things. One, if you could, to the extent you can right now, give us a little bit more modeling help on Readiness for this year \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 for next year, and maybe the year after, just in terms of how we should be ascribing it to different line items and just sort of that pace of that run rate. So maybe we could just start there.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","So again, as Juan indicated, we talked about $1 billion run rate savings at the end of year two. So that means end of 2020. So that's a run rate there. It's going to build up over time. It's not in a linear progression towards 2020. And also a part of it is going to be used to offset inflation. We do have inflation in our business, so part of the benefits will offset inflation and some market factors.","And so I think how you should be thinking about it, it's a gradual ramp-up, 2019, you recall we're going to have benefits in 2019, but by 2020 you'll get towards the run rate. It's also important to note that it doesn't stop at 2020. Readiness continues. And so while we've kind of indicated $1 billion end of 2020. When you get to 2021, 2022, there's going to be also incremental benefits associated with Readiness.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think, Vincent, you need to ramp it up. Think about the process. So we're training our 31,000 colleagues now. We have the initiatives. About half of the initiatives don't require much in terms of either CapEx, or IT resources, or new people, so we can start tackling and we can ramp up during 2019. Some of them require a little bit more capital, a little bit more IT and processes and maybe more into 2020. So, I would say soft in the first half, accelerating in the second half and then above that in 2020.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up, could you sort of discuss the farmer selling environment in both the U.S. and Brazil in particular?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I would say in the U.S., recently there's been a little bit of a slowdown over the last couple of weeks in farmer selling. It has been more obviously the farmer keeping their soybeans, thinking about a potential resolution of the trade dispute and whether that could top North American soybeans.","In Brazil it's been a little bit more driven by \u2013 more than currency and numbers by the freight tables and the uncertainty that that generated. I think, with the recent results in the election, there's going to be much more optimism that the freight table will probably be corrected or eliminated at the beginning of the year. So maybe that change a little bit, but that has been the biggest factor there.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. Great results.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Your line is open.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning. Nice quarter.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning. Thank you.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Heather.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","A couple of questions. I guess I wanted to start first with Q4. So if I heard correctly, you're expecting Origination to be down year-on-year, Carbohydrates down, Oilseeds up strongly and Nutrition in line. But if I remember correctly Q4 2017 there was about a $80 million benefit in merchant handling, but it was essentially like an inter-companies transfer, so I would think we would get some of that back on the Other line this Q4. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense for your view consolidated for Q4. Do you think the improvement \u2013 adjusting for that inter-company thing, do you think the improvement in Oilseeds year-on-year is going to be enough to offset the reduction in Carbohydrates and Origination?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","So, Heather, let me see if I can build a picture for you. So in Q4, in Origination, certainly we're not going to have the China demand pull, but the rest of the world will be coming to us, particularly for corn. So we still expect destination marketing to offset some of the export that we have lost with China and we have already, if you will, almost 70% of that bulk, we already know the volume and the margins. So I would say Origination without those $80 million would probably be in line with last year. So I think that the team has done a good job of offsetting some of the China impact in the business.","Oilseeds, as you mentioned, and we mentioned before, I expect it to be very strong and much improved versus last year. Healthy crush margins and volumes, that will continue.","Carbohydrate Solutions; the issue is Starches and Sweeteners continue to be very solid. The issue \u2013 and milling. The issue continues to be ethanol and recently, we have seen people taking some capacity down or \u2013 but probably still not enough because obviously we're getting into the low end of the season from a driving perspective.","And Nutrition results, although we're still going to have some impact of lysine on the Q4, they're going to be stronger. So we feel we're going to cap a very, very strong year for ADM with a very good quarter for us.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","And Heather, just on your question on Other, yeah, last year we had a big negative on Other because of the insurance payments. So this year we're not going to expect that to have a big negative in Other.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. That's what I thought. Now, moving to 2019. So, I mean, listening to the \u2013 if I go back and look at the commentary on Decatur earlier in the year, and then clearly I don't remember the last time I heard you all talk about peanuts, so it must be a big issue. With that and what's going on with lysine, am I wrong in thinking those are sizable tailwinds, assuming they're resolved, sizable tailwinds going into 2019?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, that's what I explained to Cornell in the first question before. The peanut was a combination of difficult merchandising situation in North America, but we also lost pretty much the peanut crop in Argentina. That produced a loss in Argentina that we normally don't have. So that was a loss due to the dry weather in Argentina. So peanut was a very strange situation that normally will not happen to us. As I said, you never heard about peanut before.","Then the Decatur plant, it's a plant that, listen, based on the integration of that plant and the great cost position, it's a plant that we normally run very, very aggressively. And we've gotten into some mechanical reliability issues over the summer, especially with the cooling tower. That has impacted that facility. It's a very integrated facility, as you can imagine from a corn wet mill that we produce more than 20 products and that feeds the value products facility where we produce some of our specialties.","So that goes into lysine, that goes into some of the polyols or hydrocolloids that we have in Nutrition. So, all these units are very intertwined. So you see the impact over-spilling a little bit in Nutrition and that with Nutrition being a smaller division, it was hit the hardest this quarter just because in sweetener \u2013 in Starches and Sweeteners, we have larger volumes we can absorb that a little bit better.","So but those issues, we are diligently addressing them. We have seen some improvement already in October. So we foresee that all those issues will be behind us and hopefully we don't pick up new ones in 2019.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","And if I think about Origination in 2019, and let's just assume there's no resolution to the U.S.-China issue, however, there clearly were numerous issues around the globe with wheat crops and I would \u2013 it seems intuitive that wheat export demand would be good in 2019, but just can you give us a sense of how 2019's shaping up in your mind for the Origination business, even if there is no help on the China side?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, Heather. So a couple of things here in Origination that you have to think about. First of all, we are utilizing very much our storage. We have tenants for every storage that we have and we have good ownership position. So we're going to continue to get carries as bases (43:31) appreciate. We're certainly going to have if \u2013 in the premise that China disputes are not resolved, we're going to have an ability to export a lot from the U.S. as our products will be very competitive.","Destination marketing continues to do very well, opened up new markets for us, so we can offset the decline in China exports. And also, we don't offset it one for one, but we \u2013 the team has done a very good job of that. Global Trade will continue to match these origins with destination.","As you said, with the bad weather in Australia and bad weather in Europe, wheat in the U.S. will become competitive and we will see growth in exports that we didn't have particularly this year. This year, obviously we have drop in soy exports and wheat exports, and we have an increase in corn. So we expect some of that to change for next year.","And then, we have some of the businesses that have been growing steadily in our business, in our Origination business, whether it's the Fertilizer business, Transportation doing very strong, and also the Stevedoring business that continue to provide solid year-over-year growth. So, overall, we feel strongly about how Origination is positioning itself. And now, ADM, with other key players in the industry, has taken the lead on bringing digital into the relationship with the farmer. And it's not only the benefit in the relationship with the farmer and our sales and our purchases to the farmer, but also in the cost that can alleviate to us. This had a lot of manual work, there's a lot of paperwork, a lot of waste, very antiquated technology and we think that there is an advantage there to get into blockchain or new digital. So, we feel very good about Origination for 2019, actually.","Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks. I might not have caught it, but are there any mark-to-market benefits in third quarter in crushing? And if so, does it kind of roll over into fourth quarter and make fourth quarter a little tougher? And then, I guess, what I'm also asking about fourth quarter for crushing and Origination is, obviously, it's going to be a lot better than last year, but is it sequentially improving also? Or is it kind of \u2013 I mean, I kind of have it flattish versus third for crushing and Origination.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hey, Rob. It's Ray here. So, normally, in these calls, we would outline any timing effects specifically if it's over $50 million. We've been very consistent about that. So, we didn't outline any timing effects in this call.","What's happened this year, Rob, is that we did enact a new cash flow hedge program for U.S. soybean crush. We started at the beginning of the year. We phased it in with the new hedges. So, it actually allows us to actually start deferring a lot of these mark-to-market impacts on soybean crush that really causes a little bit of volatility in our quarterly results.","And so, we started the program in the beginning of the year. We phased it in. And so, in this quarter, what was interesting is we did have some favorable \u2013 some reversals from the prior quarters, so there was a positive impact there. There were some positive impact related to timing effects on the hedges that didn't qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, but we also had negative timing effects related to the cash positions that are not eligible for this type of deferral.","So, on balance, Rob \u2013 on balance, we actually had a slight negative timing effect for the quarter, and that will add towards the cumulative negative effects that we had at the end of the second quarter. And so, we are carrying into the fourth quarter and into the new year negative timing effects that will reverse out as we move through frankly the next three quarters.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Complicated...","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Hopefully that was clear.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, complicated answer, but at the end of the day it's a slight negative not a positive in third quarter, if you, kind of, reverse it.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. So, the way, it's \u2013 the way I kind of look at it, it's a clean quarter that we had in the third quarter results.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, and so, just sequentially just in terms of the volume you crush maybe in fourth quarter, is the volume higher than in third and, therefore, we should expect fourth quarter to be even better than third?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Normally, that's the case, Rob, right, with the harvest and all that. Normally, the fourth quarter crushing volumes would be a little bit higher than the third quarter crushing volumes. Although I'd just remind you, we had exceptional third quarter crushing volume, just because of strong global demand. So, the delta from third quarter to fourth quarter in terms of increased volumes, like this year, it will be less than normal patterns just because of the strong third quarter.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then the spot margins are kind of moving a little bit lower, but may not \u2013 may or may not accurately reflect what's happening. Is that what you're saying?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Don't forget, we had a lot of it hedged already too, right?","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. Okay. Okay. And then, a follow-up question. You mentioned as part of Readiness that a lot of processes have been standardized and centralized, and I think it's kind of hard for the Street to get a sense of what that means. So, can you give us a couple of examples of processes that have gone through that and how it impacts your bottom line?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, sure. So when we designed the company, you can replicate the company in about 12 global processes. Processes like, for example, prospect to cash is the process from when you get to prospect being a customer all the way to you convert it to customer and you get it to the final cash. And basically, what we do with that is we analyze the process. We look at the number of steps and then we optimize the process to try to determine how many steps can we reduce or simplify or standardize, and basically what that does is two things. It eliminates errors, eliminate waste or low value work, and basically free up people to be out in the street selling more, or actually growing the company with the same amount of people.","So if you think about our company, about 60 something billion dollars with 31,000 people, I think that constantly looking at that, and the productivity of our employees, is how can we continue to grow and handle more complexity, and more variety with the same number of people, if you will. And that's what we're trying to do, and that's what we're training the 31,000 people to being able to be more flexible and redeploy them as we grow, and as we achieve more efficiencies. So, this is happening across the company.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, a lot of my specific questions have been answered, but maybe one just looking into 2019. I mean, if we look at states like North Dakota and South Dakota, between them they plan to divide 12 million acres of beans this year, about 60% to 70% of those beans were exported, probably mostly to China. What's your company's thoughts on what happens in these states next year? And how much incremental corn could we see, or wheat, or other crops, could we see being planted next spring? And what might the ramifications of all of that be on ADM's business as we go through 2019, and assuming that the tires stay in place and we get a big swing out of beans in the Midwest.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Sure, Ann. First of all, I think, it's still too early to kind of speculate what the planning intentions will be of the farmers in 2019. I think, when you read a lot of the analyst reports from economic research, it would suggest that we're going to be down on bean acreage and up on corn acreage, right? And so \u2013 and also up on wheat acres now. So on balance, the amount planted will probably be very, very similar. Just the mix will be a little bit different. Now how much lower in terms of soybean plantings compared to this year, that's to be determined. I mean, I think, there's a lot of factors that will play out, frankly, over the next several quarters before we get towards a number.","But I think the implications for ADM is like there's still going to be strong demand for U.S. products. I mean, even if you take a scenario that U.S.-China trade tensions continue, the rest of the world is actually coming to United States for its products, and we anticipate that will continue in 2019 here.","So, as Juan indicated, our outlook for Origination in 2019 remains very robust, based upon strong global demand and based upon the actions we're taking and based upon the growth of our Global Trade business, destination marketing based business, Stevedoring and all the other businesses there.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think, Ann, also as Ray said, I mean, it's almost \u2013 it's impossible to forecast changes in policies. So what we work very heavily is in to get our team being very agile and very well-connected between Global Trade and the processing businesses, and also to keep our asset base very flexible.","This business it looks stable, but under the water there is a lot of rationalization and optimization of elevator (53:44) in our Origination business as we make some of these scenario planning if you will.","So I think that the team has done very well of \u2013 at adjusting to all these conditions in very volatile years and difficult years. So, we just continue to be very close to our customers, our farmers and continue to have our operations very flexible to be able to react to that quickly.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But you did call out during the commentary that you had lower elevator margins in Q3. Could you just expand on that, and what is the outlook for elevator margins going into 2019 assuming all things remain as is?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I would say going into Q4 we have seen a compression of the seeds to fall (54:32) spread of course, as we have less exports from China. Going into 2019, we feel \u2013 we feel good about the ability of the U.S. to export corn, soybeans are going to be very cheap, continue to be in, the U.S. and wheat could come into play, as we said before, due to the low productions of Australia and Europe. So I think in general we feel good. It's just sometimes we will like that pop in Q4 that, at this point, maybe we're not going to have.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful to get the color. And then just a quick follow-up on European softseed. I mean, given the drought conditions over there and the lack of feed for livestock from things like grass and hay, would you anticipate maybe softseed margins in Europe being stronger next year, year-over-year, just until we get through the next growing season?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, I think our perspective is softseed margins should continue being strong over in Europe as we go into 2019. And again, a lot of it's driven by good biodiesel demand, and just good oil values that we're seeing in that part of the world.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But more on the oil side, not the meal side?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Well, the meal side is also a contributing factor, but we've seen some strength on the oil side as well.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll take it offline. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thanks.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Let me just switch gears a little bit here, and I'd like to get a little more flavor on the WILD and Nutrition business. Right now, that business is about a $400 million OP business, and I think the visibility for that to be $1 billion of OP in the next, let's just say, several years for lack of a better word, let's say, two to three years, is really high.","Could you talk a little bit more about that, Juan? You've got a couple of new plants there. One in Brazil that's just coming on line. They haven't generated a return yet, but it's a very high return business and I think the visibility for that $1 billion of OP in WILD is actually quite high, and I'm not sure that that point has come across well here this morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Eric, for the question. I touch it a little bit on my remarks. I mean, we are very excited about it and if you look at our trajectory when we started with WILD Flavors, we started the business of Nutrition, if you will, with some specialties that the basic processing businesses were expanded into.","So the Oilseed business has expanded into specialty proteins. The carbohydrates or the corn business expanded into polyols and into fibers like Fibersol. And we needed to be able to provide a better solutions for our customers and we needed to be able to formulate those solutions as we get into flavors.","WILD Flavors was a spectacular story. WILD Flavors profit in 2014 were $78 million before we took it over and this year they're going to be around $170 million. So, it certainly has been more than 20% compounded annual growth rate in profitability in those.","But when we started to get to the revenue synergies with WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, we can see now how that portfolio is resonating with our customers. We've been saying for the last two or three quarters that our portfolio is very successful with our customers, and we see now revenue growth of around 10% for WFSI which is the combination of those, a formulation of all that flavor with Specialty Ingredients, and operating profit growth of more than 30% year-over-year.","And if you take that Nutrition theme with that WFSI and you think about adding into that the oils portfolio we have, the starches we have, the sweeteners we have, the acidulants, and the flavors we have, there isn't any other company out there with such a broad portfolio and technical expertise, and that's the interesting discussions that happen at the customer base.","So we have all that, which is about $2.5 billion of revenue, if you will, at this point in time, but growing aggressively at about that 10%. Then, we're going to do the same with Animal Nutrition, with the Neovia. Neovia is another WILD Flavors, if you will, for this. That's about $3.5 billion. And then, we have all the area of Health & Wellness and the personalized Nutrition with Protexin, Biopolis and all that incipient. So, we have those three main axes and we see our way into delivering what you just described, getting into maybe $1 billion over the next few years.","So, it takes a while. Like it happened with WILD, you go into profitability improvement, then you develop the revenue synergies. The same is going to happen with the Animal Nutrition. But it's been very successful so far and we plan to replicate that model into Animal Nutrition. And in the meantime, we're building our Health & Wellness and personalized Nutrition portfolios. So, all very good, all very affordable, all within the financial discipline of our returns.","And the cadence, if you look at what we have done in order to assure execution, we'd done WILD Flavors in October 2014, and we didn't do Neovia until 2018, until we make sure that we have proven that model, we're making the money and the business is working. So, now, we are ready to move to Neovia and we're going to continue with that discipline and that cadence to guarantee to the shareholders that we are investing their money wisely.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Good. Thank you. One quick follow-up question here, and it's on the Oilseed market, particularly U.S. soybeans. Obviously, we know where the pricing is. I also have looked at this and we've probably got the widest basis on soybeans that I've ever seen. You can go buy soybeans $1 under board. Your cash prices are $1 plus consistently over the last two, three, four months below board.","So, we have the cheapest soybeans in the world. We're trading 25%, even a little bit more below Brazilian prices. And I can't understand, I think China has to come in and buy beans sometime in December and January, despite all the rhetoric that they've found new sources for this and that. But I tend to take a little bit more bullish outlook on soybeans, on U.S. soybean market here, but maybe I have some irrational exuberance here. Could you help me out with that thought process, Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, I would say we can get into the same thinking. The reality is that the window is getting shorter and China is finding ways not to use U.S. beans. There is also early planting in Mato Grosso in Brazil. It could lead to early harvest. So maybe China will hold into buying beans until they can overlap with Brazil.","So, I think that we have that upside of potential beans from the U.S. in Q4, early Q1. But, on the other hand, it may not happen. So, again, early harvest in Brazil could make them able to not to touch U.S. beans.","Listen, we're going into Q4 with a strong momentum. It's just that \u2013 so fundamentally Q4 is going to be a strong Q4. It's just that a lot of things could happen with either bases or mark-to-market that could make some profits go into Q4 or Q1, and that is difficult to forecast. What we know is our operating rates are strong. We have a lot of our book already locked, as I said, even with the export in our Origination business.","So, we're going with a strong momentum into Q4. We don't foresee any strange things into Q4. It's just that some of the mark-to-market and the end of the year movement could be that some of the profits end up in Q4 or some of the profits end up in Q1. That doesn't change the fundamental nature of our solid businesses at this point in time.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Correct. Okay. Thank you, Juan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, Ken.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just a couple of tidbit questions. One is, when you think about 2019 which divisions do you think will show the greatest growth and which ones will be the greatest stability? Are you looking for a rebound in ethanol? Just kind of some parameters to that. My second question is, does your divisional outlook reflect or would change if China does get resolved or not? Is it one way is better than the other? Can you just frame those two kind of questions? And I just have a quick follow-up.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Sure. I would say the division that will grow the most in 2019 versus 2018 will be Nutrition. Nutrition will have the biggest jump that they ever had in percentage basis. So ethanol could be an upside. Of course, this year was pretty bad in ethanol and we expect that next year \u2013 there are a couple of things with ethanol that it could make you more optimistic. One is the fact that the price is so low of ethanol, that I think as an oxygenator or an octane booster it could find a way into more gasoline producing countries, if you will.","The second is that we may not have as many expansions or the bottlenecks to absorb next year, and this was part of the issue this year. But I will say Nutrition will be the biggest business.","In terms of the second part of the question was about...","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","China.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Was about China, yes. I would say, listen, for companies like us that are trying to match origin with destinations, having the most optionality is the best. So I think in the long term, having those issues solved and having free trade around the world is the best. The same for the farmer. If you are producing, you want the most optionality to place your production everywhere. So I will say no doubt from a long-term perspective, we want a resolution to that.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then there's a lot of discussion about potential assets coming to sale over the next 6 to 12 months as a company under review. Would you be willing to participate in the consolidation agri business. You haven't really mentioned it. There was probably three or four calls ago you guys were a little bit more \u2013 discussed it a little bit more. Can you talk about where you're positioned now, would you be willing to participate in consolidation? And I'll leave it there.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Listen, we like our strategy and we're implementing that and we've been transparent on that. Of course we look at every option and we always review our stand-alone plans. So, we normally look at that. We are participating in the consolidation. You see our acquisition of Algar, our joint venture in Egypt, So, we're going to look at every deal on their own merits. We're going to keep our returns objective. We're going to keep our strong value creation mind-set, and if something makes sense, we may look at that.","At this point in time, our strategy is clear, and I think we've been articulating it, and we continue to execute that and grow earnings and returns, and we're very pleased with that so far.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks a lot.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Adam.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","A lot of ground has been covered. So I'll try to keep it brief. Just on the Readiness program, the $1 billion of savings in two years, and I think there was an illusion to there being some inflationary offsets. Do you have a net savings target that you're willing to share at this point? Or how much should we think about the conversion from gross to net savings, similarly your productivity programs in the past, those have been gross numbers, I just want to make sure we're all reasonably calibrated on that point.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Listen, Adam, no, we don't have a precise number like that. I understand the need to create a model. Our focus of course is to keep making the company better. So we know, and we know that 2,500 initiatives there has a lot of meat and a lot of profit that will come to the stream. Exactly how they're going to come, we're going to get more proficient in that as we have started executing.","At this point in time we are prioritizing all those 2,500 initiatives. We know because we have committed with you that we wanted to come at this meeting with an idea of the bulk of it. How much is going to pull through to the P&L at this point in time is a little bit premature for us to give more guidance than the one that we have provided already, so...","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly, the corporate expense this year, it's up a pretty decent amount. I think there was some Readiness program costs and expenses in there, some of the ERP stuff as well as you talked about effective compensation, given the performance this year. Is there any reasonable expectation that you could provide on 2019 Corporate at this point?","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I mean, I think the run rates that we're seeing right now, are probably a little higher than where we're going to end up, but it's not going to be totally out of line kind of with what we're running for the quarter. Maybe just slightly lower on a run rate basis.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today.","This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.60, up 43% from the prior-year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $678 million. Our year-over-year results improved as a company and in all four of our business segments in the first quarter, and we continue to be on course for a stronger 2017.","Ag Services was up for the quarter with higher results in U.S. grain and transportation operations. The Corn business delivered a good quarter with improved performances across their portfolio. Oilseed earnings were up, including solid results in global softseeds and from our equity investment in Wilmar. WFSI results were higher, led by WILD Flavors. We are advancing our strategic plan with a pending acquisition of French sweetener company, Chamtor; the announcements of expansions to our Animal Nutrition capabilities in China and a further investment in Wilmar.","We also implemented about $50 million in run-rate cost savings during the first three months of the year. And in line with our balance capital allocation framework, we returned more than $400 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.","We are continuing to execute the long-term strategic plan that we launched in 2012, and we're seeing the results. We have strengthened our core, improving our cost positions and implementing measures to improve results where necessary. Our operational excellence initiatives have delivered significant savings and efficiencies, and we continue to grow strategically by expanding into new geographies and increasing our capabilities in food, beverages and feed. Those actions contributed to the improved results we saw in the first quarter despite still muted margin environment in some businesses and the continued momentum in the execution of our plan gives us confidence that we will deliver sustainable value creation.","I'll provide more detail on our results later in the call. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, up from the $0.42 last year. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $678 million, up $105 million from the year-ago quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26% compared to 25% in the first quarter of the prior year. The slight increase in our tax rate is primarily due to the expiration of U.S. tax credits including the biodiesel tax credit, partially offset by changes in the forecast geographic mix of earnings.","Our trailing four-quarter-average adjusted ROIC of 6.4% is unchanged from the end of the first quarter last year. Our ROIC has continued to improve for the third consecutive quarter following the challenging operating conditions that we experienced during the first half of 2016.","For 2017, we have established our annual weighted average cost of capital at 6.0% following a detailed review of interest rates, equity risk premiums and betas in our cost of capital model. Similarly, our long-term WACC has been updated to 7.0% based upon our review of assumptions and benchmarks.","On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of a, reported quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share. For this quarter, we had a $0.01 per share charge related to asset impairments and restructurings; a $0.01 per share LIFO gain; and certain discrete tax items of $0.01 per share.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. In Ag Services, we had approximately $7 million in impairment and restructuring charges primarily related to our restructuring efforts in the global trade desk. In Corn and Oilseeds, we had small impairments and restructuring charges.","In the Corporate Lines, net interest expense was up approximately $11 million due to higher short-term interest rates and our overall mix of short- and long-term debt the following the issuance of new fixed rate debt in August of last year.","Unallocated corporate of $132 million was up versus the prior year due to a higher people cost, including benefit accruals as well as our increased investments in innovation, IT and business transformation, yet modestly below our $140 million per quarter guidance for fiscal year 2017 that we provided at the last earnings call. Minority interest and other charges improved to $20 million, primarily due to improved results from our equity investment in CIP.","Turning to the cash flow statement on slide 6, we generate about $508 million from operations before working capital changes during the period, down slightly from the prior-year period. Total capital spending for the period was $200 million, about similar to the prior year. Acquisitions of $90 million in the first quarter were primarily related to Crosswind Industries, a pet treat manufacturer. The other investing activities line up the cash flow statement includes the incremental investments we made in Wilmar, bringing our total ownership stake to approximately 24.3%. During the quarter, we spent about $248 million to repurchase shares, consistent with our prior guidance of $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the year subject to strategic capital requirements.","Our average share count for the quarter is 579 million diluted shares outstanding, down 18 million from the time one year ago. At the end of the quarter, we had 577 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was more than $400 million for the quarter.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016. In summary, our balance sheet remains strong. Our operating working capital of $7.4 billion was down $280 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was $7.2 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $6.5 billion.","Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.1 billion was slightly down from the $17.9 billion level last year, due to returns of capital and changes in the cumulative translation account. We had $5.1 billion global credit capacity at the end of March. If you add available cash, we had access to $5.8 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next, Juan will take us through a review of business performance. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $678 million of operating profit excluding the specified items, up from $573 million in the last year's first quarter.","In 2017, we are seeing some improving market conditions as well as benefits from the actions we have taken and continue to take as we execute our strategic plan. First quarter adjusted segment operating profit was up more than 18% versus the year-ago quarter despite muted margin environments persisting for some of our businesses.","Now, I'll review the performance of each segment. So, starting on slide 9, Ag Services results were up year-over-year. Merchandising and Handling results were down versus the prior-year quarter. In North America, demand for grain exports remains strong and the business benefited from good execution volumes and improvements in grain carries. The improved results in North American grain operations were offset by lower results in international merchandising.","As expected, results from international merchandising remained muted in the first quarter. This with substantial global supply of crops continues to limit merchandising opportunities. In addition, the group was impacted by some mark-to-market timing effects, restructuring charges and low volumes at four facilities, which negatively impacted our results in Argentina.","We are beginning to see the benefits of our aggressive actions to improve our international merchandising performance and continue to expect that results will improve, as we move through the year.","Transportation was up substantially. Our North America barge and stevedoring operations saw increased loads and our stevedoring operations reported record volumes. Milling and Other had a solid quarter, but with lower sales volumes and product margins.","And finally, just yesterday, we completed the sale of our Crop Risk Services business to Validus Holdings, which advance our strategy by freeing capital for strategic redeployment while allowing ADM to partner with Validus to offer customers a full array of ADM's grain marketing products and services.","Please turn to slide 10. Corn processing had a strong quarter. In sweeteners and starches, strong demand drove sales volume and margin growth. A key component of our plan is the strategic growth, and the Corn business exemplifies the benefits of executing that strategy.","We are continuing to see higher volumes and margins from our European business. The results out of our new sweetener complex in Tianjin, China, also improved over the year-ago quarter.","Another important driver of success for Corn was bioproducts. Export demand for U.S. ethanol is high. Ethanol margins were better than the year-ago quarter due to exports as well as solid domestic demand.","Our lysine business had better margins versus the year-ago period, thanks to better pricing and improvements in production cost. Lysine improvements helped animal nutrition overall achieve a better quarter despite warmer weather that limited overall sales volumes. Lastly, the Corn business was impacted by about $10 million due to unplanned repairs to a large water pipe in the Decatur complex.","Turn to slide 11, please. Oilseeds delivered one of its strongest recent quarters with overall results up year-over-year. Our crushing and origination results were largely flat. As expected, despite good global demand for protein meal overall, global soybean crush margins remained pressured as alternative protein meals continued to impact the market.","We expect feed wheat supplies to largely clear the market by the end of the second quarter and demand for soybean meal to increase in Europe.","Our global softseed processing footprint and flex capacity have continued to be positive factors. And oil and cottonseed results were both significantly higher than the previous year as we capitalized on margin opportunities both in North America and Europe.","In Brazil, margin has been compressed as farmer selling hasn't kept pace with export demand due to weak commodity prices and the strong Brazilian real. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were down for the quarter. In Europe, food oils were lower as a solid performance from the team was offset by timing effects.","North American biodiesel volumes and margins were down. South American packaged oils and biodiesel were up for the quarter on better volumes and margins. Golden Peanut and Tree Nut was up on improved margins and a strong plant productivity.","Results in Asia improved significantly over the prior-year quarter, reflecting our increased ownership and improved results from Wilmar. Our team in India also delivered higher results as well.","On slide 12, WFSI results were higher for the quarter. The WILD Flavors team delivered another great quarter. The European, Middle East and Africa WILD Flavors group had a very strong quarter with good sales volumes in Africa and the Middle East. In China, WILD Flavors is aggressively pursuing new business with good results. And WILD Flavors in North America continues to be solid and growing. We have seen a consistent pattern of double-digit growth in the WILD Flavors business and remain excited about its continued and expanding contributions.","Results from Specialty Ingredients were mixed. Specialty proteins were up overall with the strength in North America offsetting weaker results in other regions. Results in proteins were impacted by startup costs related to the Campo Grande facility, which started to sell soy flour and continues to move towards full commercialization operations later this year. Fibers were down for the quarter due to startup costs in our Tianjin complex and continued competitive price pressures.","Now on slide 13, I would like to update you on how we continue to implement our strategic plan. Since we launched our plan in 2012, we made some important progress towards becoming a more efficient company, a more global company and a company that is expanding further along the value chain. We feel we have much to do, but I am gratified by the commitment to the plan that our team has demonstrated.","As you all know, our industry has faced some significant market headwinds over the last two years, and I'm really proud that we faced those headwinds and had the discipline to continue to execute our plan. We worked to deliver cost and process efficiencies, and we invested to grow through acquisitions and plant expansions, and we continued to deliver dividends and share repurchases. We worked the levers under our control, putting us further along the path to creating long-term value for our shareholders.","In 2017 specifically, we continued to execute in our three primary areas of focus. In the area of optimizing the core, we have already discussed how our aggressive actions to improve performance have started to show results. As mentioned earlier, we have completed the sale of our Crop Risk Service businesses, which includes a grain marketing agreement with a buyer, Validus. We have achieved more than $200 million of monetizations in 2017, and we continue to be on track to achieving our $1 billion monetization target over two years.","In the area of operational excellence, we implemented about $50 million of new run rate cost savings actions through the first quarter and are on pace to meet our target of $225 million for the year. And we continue to advance our 1ADM business transformation project.","In the area of strategic growth, we are planning on adding to our European sweetener and starch footprint with the pending acquisition of Chamtor in France. We also acquired a 90% ownership stake in BIOPOLIS, a leading provider of microbial technology with a strong portfolio of novel food ingredients. We are continually expanding our capabilities throughout the value chain and with BIOPOLIS, we are once again enhancing our ability to meet the needs of health-conscious consumers.","We announced the construction of a new feed premix facility in Xiangtan, China, which will be our fifth in the country. We also announced our entry into the growing Asian aqua-feed market with the construction of an aquaculture production line at our Nanjing complex. We continued to grow our capabilities in the Australia and New Zealand region with the opening of our new flavor creation and customer service center in Sydney. And we once again expanded our equity holding in Wilmar, which continues to help us benefit from Asia's consumer growing and evolving demand for food.","These are just a few of the recent highlights, and we'll continue, as always, to update you on our progress each quarter.","So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspectives on the next quarter and the balance of the year. In Ag Services, we do anticipate a slightly better second quarter than year-ago period with the stronger grain carries, better results in Argentina and continuing improvements in global merchandising.","In the back half of the year, we'll be watching how the large South American crops impacts North American exports competitiveness. Absent any major dislocation event, we expect it will be a very competitive global environment.","We believe global demand will remain strong for the year, and we expect international merchandising to contribute more as we move through the year. Looking at the whole year, we continue to expect performance in Ag Services for calendar year 2017 to be significantly better than 2016 although likely weaker than what we have thought at the beginning of this year and more similar to 2015.","In Corn, we are expecting a significant improvement in the second quarter versus the prior year. In sweeteners and starches, we believe we will continue to see a tight North American market with solid demand and our international business will continue to grow. We expect to see continued very strong demand for U.S. ethanol in the second and third quarters with demand normalizing in the fourth quarter.","Looking at the second quarter for Oilseeds, we expect flat to lower results compared to the year-ago quarter. Soybean crush margins in the second quarter will continue to be challenged in some geographies due to ample global soybean supplied and a competitive protein meal environment.","The significant increases in crop production in Brazil will lead to better year-over-year export volumes. However, in the near term, slower producer commercialization could continue to weight on margins.","In refining, packaging and biodiesel, we are expecting a steady to improved results as food and biodiesel demand improves seasonally. In WFSI, we expect that the second quarter of 2017 will show better results than the year-ago period, and we believe that WILD Flavors will continue to string strong performances throughout the year.","So our full-year outlook for the company has not changed since our last call although the mix of earnings may be slightly different across our business segment with Ag Services maybe slightly weaker for the year and Corn and Oilseeds maybe slightly stronger.","Taken together, as we continue to execute our plan, we remain confident that the actions we are taking will yield a solid year-over-year increase in profitability and returns for 2017.","With that, Scott, I open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you and good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Good morning, David.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Good morning. David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And so I wanted to spend my time on Agricultural Services. The first quarter results of $88 million, they're still well below the five-year average for Q1 results, which we calculate at around $160 million. Previously, you guys used to give guidance for the whole segment, something like, Ray, correct me if I'm wrong, what, it's like $850 to $950 million. So can you just update us a little bit more here?","I mean, Juan, I appreciate your comments you just made on this thing, but I still find this is a very hard segment to model. So just a little bit more detail on what you expect going forward. And then the longer term, I think, is a fairly critical question that we get from a lot of investors. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, thank you, David. Of course, you have heard that we're working very hard in Ag Services to continue to improve our operations. We have been seeing or facing a couple of years of very strong headwinds into that business. We are expecting improvements \u2013 and we've seen the first quarter \u2013 we still expect an improvement in the second quarter. First quarter was characterized by a strong export out of the U.S. We export significant volumes. The margins were okay, were not spectacular, but were solid margins.","And we have some headwinds in international merchandising. With ample stocks around the world there is a very subdued environment for us to make profitable international trades, if you will, in the international merchandising business. So we've been working very hard to reduce our fixed cost, if you will, in that area, whether we shut down our office in South Africa, whether we consolidated offices in Argentina and reduce a little bit our manpower there. We have made some changes in personnel where we needed to do so.","So it's been our improvement into that business. We still believe that over time, we're going to continue to grow our earnings. We are very pleased with our destination marketing business. We continue to grow 10% our volume there. Our acquisition in Medsofts is doing well. We have opened several offices around the world. So I will say we continue to make progress.","It's still short of the range we used to hit, and we're not going to hit it this year. But this year will be better than last year. And we expect again our trend to continue in the second quarter. So I hope that satisfies, David, a little bit the outlook for Ag Services.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","It does. Thank you. And I know you want only one question, so I'll pass it along. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Okay. Thank you, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Could you discuss your views in the near-term ethanol market outlook. You had mentioned that you expect strong demand to emerge in the near term. But margins have compressed pretty meaningfully on lower-than-anticipated driving demand. You also have emerging risk from Brazil potentially implementing a 16% tariff. So I was just wondering if you can provide some your color on your near-term ethanol market outlook and then comment on how of these uncertainties may have impacted negotiations for the dry mill assets.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Sure, Sandy, yes. So the short term, I will say, we are very bullish in terms of ethanol margins. We think we're going to have a very strong Q2 and Q3. We had very strong exports in the first quarter. We expect Q2 exports to remain very strong. Even without any China in our forecast we are still expecting the industry to export about 1.1 billion, 1.3 billion gallons.","This is the time of the year in which we're going to see domestic demand accelerate as the driving season gets better, if it ever stops raining and the weather improves. And we're going to see a draw in inventories by May. So we expect strong Q2 and Q3 and volumes more normal into Q4. So all in all, we expect a good year.","Brazil, we think that this is going to put a lot of export in our books, in the industry's books by the whole first half. They've been very strong in Q1. We're going to see some of that continue into Q2. But there are other geographies, whether it's India and Canada, that continue to grow and we continue to develop new export markets.","So we're thinking 14.5 billion gallons, give or take in terms of domestic demand, plus 1.1 billion gallons, 1.3 billion gallons of exports. So we think that there is going to be very good balance for the rest of the year.","Second part of your question was to what extent this impact in our dry mills consideration. It hasn't. We continue to have the same strategic question about what we want to do with the dry mills. We haven't found any option at this point in time to execute on that was giving us the value creation that we wanted for our shareholders. So we continue to look and we continue to keep an eye on the developments on the tax reform in the U. S. that could impact some of the options or could value some of the options in different ways.","So we continue to discuss with a couple of interested parties. But probably, as I said, look inside with a little bit to the tax reform progress that the Trump administration may do this year or in next year.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","You're welcome, Sandy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Good morning, Farha.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Good morning.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Just some more color on your Oilseeds business. Could you share with us kind of color around the Brazilian harvest farmer selling and what we should look for in that oilseed processing earning year-over-year for 2017 versus 2016?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yes, sure, Farha. So as it has been widely publicized, obviously, Brazil will have a very large crop. We expect soybeans to be up in production maybe 20% versus last year. Corn, maybe 40%. So at this point in time, obviously, the dynamics in Brazil have been about farmer selling, farmer not liking the prices, not liking the currency at this point in time.","So crush margin has been maybe breakeven as best as everybody fights for soybean origination. Especially difficult may be the Mato Grosso area with the pool of beans from the north ports and Santos as the industries try to satisfy export commitments.","The crushing environment should improve in July forward as the export loses competition to the U.S. And some of the export capacity will shift probably to corn to try to deal with this maybe 93.5 million tonnes crop that Brazil is going to harvest.","The oil balance sheet would probably tighten next year as the biodiesel blend goes to \u2013 to B9 is implemented. And so that's kind of what we see Brazil at the moment. There is a lot of the balance between how much China is going to be importing versus how much the seller \u2013 the farmer will be selling and to what extent they want to keep some carryover for next year or commercialize it before they get to the corn crops.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","And the outlook for Oilseeds business, how should we think about that year-over-year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah. I think it will be better than last year. So we expect biodiesels and others to pick up seasonally. And we expect crush margins to still be a little bit subdued because we need to fight with the DDGs produced from this record ethanol and also some of the still wheat feed that is in the market for Q2.","We've seen already encouraging signs in Europe that demand is coming back to soybean meal. So we know that we are going through those inventories of wheat feed. So overall, we are positive into ending 2017 much better than 2016.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Farha, if you recall last year, 2016, two major factors dragged down Oilseeds results. One, the Wilmar equity earnings; and two, the lack of volumes in South America in terms of origination. Now, those two factors, as we look into 2017, should not be negative factors. And you've seen the strength in terms of the Wilmar equity earnings that translate into our results in the first quarter. And then with the large crop in Brazil, particularly what's expected to be a significantly improved corn crop, origination volumes in South America should be significantly higher, which will contribute towards an overall positive delta in 2017 versus 2016. So again, we expect 2017 to be a lot better than 2016. Again, we don't expect it to approach the 2015 levels. But nevertheless, 2017 for Oilseeds will be a far better year than 2016.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Morning, Eric.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So Juan, the interesting question that I have, and this is really \u2013 we've had four consecutive years of global grain production that really has only had one kind of interruption with this last year in South America. We could potentially produce a normal crop again this year. I mean, obviously, we've got good moisture, good planting. It seems like this malaise could last for awhile in Ag Services; yeah, we know it can change quickly. But the real question I have is, we've had fairly depressed commodity prices now globally for 18 months, two years, yet we still see global production going up, whether it be the Ukraine and Russia and elsewhere, I mean, maybe there are some geopolitical issues there, but where does \u2013 and it seems like the U.S. is losing share. Where does all this kind of wash out at the end? And does it keep the competitors in Ag Services out longer than we might expect?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yes. Thank you, Eric, for the question. I think, listen, I think the world continues to be \u2013 to have a strong demand for grains. And I think that as long as we have good weather, we have good inventories. But the usage is very strong. And I think that we need to continue to plant and to create production because one of these days, we're going to have a surprise, and you will see how the pendulum will swing dramatically.","But in terms of adjusting for this scenario of depressed prices and ample stocks, if that was to continue, you see what we're doing in Ag Services. Again, we are reducing our fixed cost in Ag Services to make sure that we get our returns. That's where you see our reduction in invested capital with the announcement that we did this morning in Crop Risk, whether we continue to keep in the commercialization, that relationship with the farmer. But we don't own those assets anymore. We take that invested capital out.","So again, we continue to keep our share. We continue to expand outside the U.S. You heard about our investment in the Port of Santos. You heard about our investment in the port of Barcarena in the northern part of Brazil.","We haven't been invested last year in the Port of Constanta in Eastern Europe. So we think that the production will continue to grow. And to the extent that we're going to have every now and then a dislocation while we have this strong demand, I think that the industry will be fine, and I think Ag Services will come back to the levels we used to see.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Then just one quick follow-up question. The two things that are in your control in Ag Services division is, number one, for your management, and I'd like a little update of where you sit with all your kind of management disruption in Ag Services, your international \u2013 your trading desk. But then also a quick update on your destination marketing, which that's something you can control. You can pick up a higher margin as you pick up customers, pull support post-port. So can you talk a little bit about those two issues?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Sure, Eric, yes. Listen, in international merchandising, what we've been trying to do is again, is reduce our cost per tonne of units traded. So we consolidated offices in Argentina, that is something that we needed to do, that created some redundancy in personnel, and we have some reductions there.","We closed our office in South Africa. That was a strategic decision. And we will continue to analyze other offices that whether it makes sense. At this point in time, I think that probably most of our restructuring has been done, so we wouldn't expect anything further.","In terms of personnel, as you described, some of these things were very well planned, like the head of the top four, the global trade desk, I'm sorry, the former top four unit. That has been planned for more than a year in which one very experienced trader was basically grooming his succession, and now he's retiring.","We have, every year for you to have an idea, we get an input of about 250 people in our commercial merchandising systems, and we continue to develop them and grow them.","And over time, they all grow into bigger positions, and some of our most experienced people retire. So that was \u2013 I think you shouldn't read that much into that. That was a very planned succession and in nothing reflects the issues that we have with the performance of the global trade desk.","So again, the global trade desk is just trying to reduce their cost per tonne of traded materials since the margins are a little bit lower than before. You had a second part of that, I guess, into the global trade desk, do you have another one?","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes, well....","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Destination market.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Destination marketing, yes, sorry for that, yeah.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","So destination marketing has been doing very well. Listen, we are having a dual approach. When we can, we go and acquire some vehicles out there to improve our share. Medsofts was part of that. We acquired half of that, and it's been growing very nicely and giving us very good profit growth. Volume is growing. I think it grew 10%, the volume that we have in destination marketing this quarter. So we're happy with that.","And when we don't find a unit like Medsofts where we can increase our equity stake or ownership, we go and open offices. And we have opening offices in Central America. We have been opening offices in Southeast Asia. So it's a lot of work. It's a slow work at times. But we have been seeing the pickup in margins, and we have seen in the increase in share. So we are \u2013 continue to relentlessly implement on that.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. I know it's still early, there is a lot of uncertainty. But we're hearing more and more discussion around NAFTA recently, specifically last week. Wanted to know if you can comment on anything your people are hearing in D.C. and then as we've seen more pressure on relationships, what are you kind of doing looking at the potential risk there?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Sorry, Brett, you mentioned about NAFTA?","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, thank you. You came very low there. So listen, there are many issues in the news, and you can obviously have confidence that our teams are deeply involved both in the U.S. and in Mexico on these. I think we are heading towards a discussion about NAFTA. NAFTA has been in place for 23 years. And whether you discuss with the U.S. administration or you discuss with the Mexico administration, there are issues on both sides that they would like to update and modernize NAFTA on.","NAFTA has, from our perspective \u2013 obviously it's a very important customer, whether we export to Canada, whether we export to Mexico. And I think the administration understands that. And we have a very balanced sweeteners supply and demand, if you will, that needs open trade. And I think that on both sides, whether it's sugar coming this way or high-fructose corn syrup going their way, both industries are very healthy and it's in the best interest of both countries and both industries to continue to negotiate and have discussion.","So again, we are at the table. We are helping with data and with our opinion on both sides. And I think that both sides will continue to make progress. And I can't disclose anymore at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thank you. Hey, Juan, I was hoping you can help us understand the order of magnitude as to the growth of destination marketing and its contribution to Ag Services. And maybe offset that with, I suppose, the lower cost per trade that you pointed out in your trading operations because you're restructuring and reducing personnel. It's very hard for me to understand like how much each of these elements contribute to the business, number one. And number two, like is \u2013 are you adding cost in destination marketing that are offsetting the savings that you're getting from the trading?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, let me give you some perspective, Rob, and thank you for the question. On the global trade desk, I wouldn't like to disclose my dollars per tonne of fixed cost because that's competitive information and we benchmark that. And I don't want the number out there. I will say, at this point in time, our reductions are in the tens of millions of dollars, if you will, in terms of the restructuring of that.","In terms of destination marketing, when we put together the plan, as you may recall, we described that about 15% of our global trade were going into destination marketing, we're reaching the final customer, and we were planning to move that over five years to 30%. So to kind of to double that, the amount that we were sending there. That was going to increase margins from about, let's say, $2 to $4 per tonne, to maybe something like $8 to $10 per tonne. We saw last year the increase in our volume. What was the increase to volume last year? I don't have it top of mind.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Roughly 1 million tonnes.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","I think 1 million tonnes. Yeah, and we are seeing this year an extra 10%, that's as of first quarter growing. So that's kind of the pace, if you will. To the extent that it's adding cost, it's adding cost that is included in this $8 to $10 per tonne. So we shouldn't double-count that extra cost, I will say. So I think you should think about adding earnings from the destination marketing volume that is growing and hopefully picking up something like $6 per tonne versus our original FOB trade. And then you have another source of earnings, which is a slight reduction of structural cost in the global trade desk as we improve our footprint there, as we optimize our footprint there. So those will be basically the two numbers you keep in your head.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","You're welcome Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hi, good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Morning.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Rather than we beat a dead horse on Ag Services, maybe I'll ask about the recent weather in the Midwest. There is some discussion out there that we might have lost as much as 20% of our wheat crop. We've got parts of Illinois with significant flooding. I know it's only been the past weekend, but could you comment on what this recent weather might or could do, and what kind of conversations you're having with your farmers in the region? Any change in planting intentions? What might be the outcome of all of this in your view?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, thank you, Ann. Yeah, I was flying yesterday across the area here and you realize how much standing water is there. So, very saturated fields out there. So, I guess, from a corn perspective, we see, we have planted about 34% so far, which is about on top of the average of the last five years. And I'm not sure how much progress we'll be able to make this week until the weather improves. But I think, the farmer in the U.S. have proven that with new machinery they can plant pretty much a lot of crop in a week.","In terms of wheat, I think that we received probably some damage over the weekend. And I don't know how to quantify it other than there is the Annual Wheat Tour underway this week. And I think that there people will be assessing damage. Obviously, wheat is a very sturdy crop for drought and dryness, but I'm not sure about the wind and the flooding that \u2013 or the rain that we had over the last weekend.","In terms of corn planted and soybean planted, as I told you before, about 34% in terms of corn, maybe 10% in terms of soybeans. And I think it's too early to determine any change in acres. So at this point in time, we're sticking with the same numbers and \u2013 before until we get new information from the field if there is some new information from the field.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And no change in the plant of acres on the decline in soybean prices since the initial planting intentions?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Not from our perspective, Ann, no.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in line. I appreciate it.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","You're welcome, Ann.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to go to something you've alluded to in the prepared remarks about lowering the long-term WACC to 7% from 8% previously. And maybe does that change the \u2013 is the long-term target still 200 basis points over WACC? So, is it \u2013 we're now thinking ROIC can get to 9%, not the 10% previously. And if so, does that imply kind of, I mean, any change in the longer term kind of implied earnings, kind of outlook for the business and maybe the corollary there is the weakness and we talked a lot about Ag Services on this call already. But has the performance in Ag Services this quarter and through this crop year made you revisit kind of the embedded Ag Services' earnings contribute to that $230 million (50:03) that's in your kind of base EPS algorithm?","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Adam, we've reviewed basically the underlying cost of capital model over the past several quarters. And so, we took a hard look at long-term interest rates, equity risk premiums, betas in our model. If you recall, when we established the 8% long-term WACC, that was done back in 2012, 2013, and looking back historically over 20 years. And so, some of those assumptions, frankly, were outdated as we kind of look through these assumptions, we did some benchmarking. And so, once we kind of update our model for, like long-term interest rates, recent long-term interest rates, recent equity risk premiums, we determined that it made sense to update the long-term WACC to 7% from 8%.","And a big driver of that was really equity risk premiums, which have come down over time. In terms of what it means, our long-term objective still remains 200 basis points over long-term WACC. So, that \u2013 the spread has not changed in terms of how we're targeting the organization for results.","In terms of your comment on Ag Services, I mean, naturally, when we set projects and when we look at projects that we're evaluating across all the businesses; there's clearly a spread above even the 200 basis points over the long-term WACC. So, our hurdle rates remain significantly higher in the double-digit areas. And we, frankly \u2013 we are not going to really adjust those hurdle rates because, we still believe it makes sense to really drive all the businesses to achieve strong earnings and strong returns. But at least from our perspective, as we kind of think about longer term, what makes sense for our company over a cycle, we do believe like 7%-plus the 200 basis points spread gets you to 9% that over a cycle, we should be achieving about a 9% type of return for this company.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So \u2013 but I just want to be clear on that, arithmetically right, you've taken 100 basis points of ROIC, which on your current invested capital base is like $240 million of NOPAT, which is like $0.40 of EPS. In theory, off-the-table, I'm trying to understand what's that \u2013 like how that exactly changed if at all or it's just a messaging comparing apples and oranges here?","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","No, we haven't changed our assessment in terms of long-term earnings for the company. And so from our perspective, we still believe that it is important for us to kind of drive this 200 basis point spread over our long-term cost of capital.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Jones with the Vertical Group. Your line is open.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. I have a two-pronged question on farmer-selling. Just wondering, given the recent rally in corn and the devaluation of the real, we've been seeing reports of meaningful acceleration of farmer-selling both here and in Brazil, and we just wonder if you could comment on what you're seeing in recent days in that area.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yes, I think, Heather, thanks for the question. Yeah, what we have seen in both places in South America is this equation. I think that when farmers see a rally or when farmers see a change in the currency that's what we see in the sale. Other than that they are holding to the products. Of course, with these big crops, at one point in time they would have to think about how full they're in \u2013 their storage bins are. And as we get further into the harvest, it might prompt more farmer-selling. But at this point in time, we get to one of the weakest farmer-selling rates that we have seen in maybe six years, seven years. So, they are just \u2013 sales are picking up at rallies or change in forex.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","So to be more specific, like in the last week or two weeks, we've seen roughly a 2% to 3% increase in corn prices and about a 3% devaluation of real. So, I mean, I know we're still behind a year-ago in the five-year average. But has there been a meaningful pickup in selling there or just or would you call it a slight increase?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","We've seen an increase, but I would not call it meaningful, Heather.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Just wanted to circle back a little bit to the ethanol side of the business. And just, you talked about an optimism on exports and really, do you see that carrying into the outer years? And really, I guess, what is sort of the longer-term impact of this Brazilian tariff given that historically it's been a strong market? So, I just wanted to circle back there longer-term thoughts on ethanol.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, Michael. Well, Brazil has been a strong market at times and a strong exporter to the U.S. at times. So, we've seen everything in Brazil. I would say, from a long-term perspective, we continue to see markets that really need ethanol for environmental reasons, whether there are some of the Asian countries. And we still see ethanol more than maybe $0.45 per gallon cheaper than MTBE and other alkylates. So, I would say, I think that as long as the U.S. is perceived as being a reliable supplier, we will continue to incorporate new markets. And whether \u2013 we haven't touched much of Japan yet, we haven't touched much of Mexico yet. So, I think we still have a long way to grow, and we are seeing growth in our existing countries, whether it's Canada and India, as I said before. And Brazil has been a nice counterbalance for China this year.","So, it's dynamic, and every year changes a little bit. But the reality is, this is the cheapest oxygenate in the world, and it will continue to find a place. And we've seen that as the U.S. grows a little bit domestic demand, and we've seen that this 1.1 billion to 1.3 billion-gallon type of ratio that we have today is creating good margins. And we think, as I said in my previous question, that Q2 and Q3 will be very strong. And we do believe that maybe a situation like this with the same seasonality may repeat itself in 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just quick question. When you're saying about high-fructose corn syrup and the negotiations, how important is it the \u2013 how much is the exports to Mexico over the last couple of years really tighten up the utilization rates in the U.S.? And if that were to slow, how would that impact you guys in negotiations?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Hey, Ken. So think about it, I think that when \u2013 over the last couple of years, the industry has been maybe from a demand perspective, losing 1% per year or sometimes flat. It has been like that. And about 5% of capacity has been taken out of the industry that has tightened up. The U.S. sends about 11% of the total volume to Mexico. But it's also true that the U.S. gets about 1 million ton of sugar, which is about 18% of the sugar Mexican market.","So, at this point in time, it's kind of a very balanced there. And I was mentioning the 1% decline in demand because five years ago, we decided that just in case demand decline will accelerate, we will start an aggressive program of what we call Fight for the Grind, so finding new uses for the grind.","And we have seen growth in our portfolio of other products different than just high-fructose corn syrup, that has helped also to tighten the market even further because it has given us options, whether it's product for cardboard or other industries that are different than just sweeteners. So, I think we feel that we have optionality if some of these will be impacted.","We don't believe that the both countries are going into a trade war, if you will. We think that there's going to be a negotiation. And we think, as I said that flow over the board, there is pretty balance. Again, with 2 billion pounds of high-fructose corn syrup going south and 1.1 million tons of sugar coming north. So, it could impact us. We have optionality. We don't think it's very likely. That will be my summary, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, guys. I was thinking about Chinese soy oil consumption and the dynamic that was raised was that consumer concerns over GMO have sort of gotten to the point where regular soy oil is starting to decline in terms of supermarket sales and the consumers are moving towards non-GMO alternatives, whether it's sunflower, peanuts, sesame or what have you. And so I'm just wondering, I guess, two things. One, to what extent is that impacting margins or demand for regular soy oil there from your perspective? And two, what opportunity does it provide for you to service the market with those alternative products, which apparently are selling at pretty good premiums?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, Vince. There are two dynamics here. One is, maybe the creation of a little bit of a premium market for non-GMO product, maybe like it happening everywhere, and that provides an opportunity, both for ourselves and maybe for some of our partners in the area. On the other hand, there is a big emphasis in the government to try to educate the people about GMO not being an issue. If you are in China and you need to feed the population, you understand that with 6% of the water on 8% of the arable land and 22% of the population, you need all the productivity you can get. And that's one of the reasons that the government is trying to educate the population on the benefits of GMO.","So, I think that at this point in time, it's a little bit of a niche market. We will try and take advantage on that. I think that over time, GMO will be pervasive in Asia and in China as they need it to feed the population.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","You're welcome, Vince.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Anderson with Stifel. Your line is open.","Vincent Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to switch gears quickly and ask about the opportunities you see in sort of biomass-based substitutes for traditional petrochemicals. I know it's not new technology, and we have seen some smaller producers stumble recently in trying to get this market off the ground again. But from your perspective, are the major hurdles here more of a scale and reliability of supply issue that somebody of Archer Daniels' size could address? Or is it feedstock economics relative value with your other corn products? But, yeah, is this more of a blue-sky research effort in terms of your overall portfolio, or is there a meaningful contribution that could come from this over the next three years to five years, call it?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, thank you for the question, Vincent. I think the biggest factor in this is to get a sponsoring customer or on a sponsoring application. I think the technology works. I think the economics could be made to work at this levels of both oil and corn prices. I think that ADM is always in the conversation because of our enormous fermentation available capacity. So, we can bring things to the market faster than other people.","So, we are engaged with people that are looking for those optionalities as they try to attach their brands to more renewal of products. This is something that, as I said from a technology perspective, it's not an issue. You got to get the timing right. You don't want to be too early into that, and we have seen what happened with that. So we've been prudent into that. And we try to align ourselves, as I said, with large accounts. And you heard our relationship with DuPont in that space. And we have others in the fire that if those accounts feel that there is a time to launch renewal products into the market, we could do so with our fermentation capacity, absolutely.","And it's a little bit of what I described before our efforts into Fight for the Grind. There are things that are more immediate that we're doing right now. There are things like plastics or biomass replacing petroleum plastics that are maybe more hypothetical or in the future, but they are still being looked.","Vincent Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you. And just quickly, would there be, as you think about the most immediate opportunity, would there be any kind of significant capital requirements behind that? I know we're talking hypotheticals here.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, there are capital mostly in terms of pilot plants and I think adjusted some things. But we have some units that, as we have from the times of the PHA, original things that are available if we wanted to bring them into production. And I don't think they will take a massive amount of capital.","Vincent Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking the follow-up. I have two follow-ups. The first one is just on second quarter ethanol. Juan, you said several times on the call, your optimism. As I look at spot margins right now, they don't actually look very good. So, I'm curious about your confidence in the second quarter. Is ADM hedged and somehow, this is why you've got such good confidence, or is it fundamentally you expect a tick-up in the spot ethanol margins from here for the factors that you previously talked about?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","So, that's the first one or those were the two?","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's the first question, and then I have a follow-up to Ray.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","No worries, no worries. So, let me address a little bit of both. I mean, we hedge a little bit, as we always do. But it's in our confidence about the program we have forward in terms of the orders that we see coming, the export demand that we see. And we believe that, May, we will see a significant drop in inventories. And so, it's a little bit of both, if you will. But we feel that we see in our forecast that Q2 in ethanol will be significantly better than last year, the Q2 last year. David, you said you have another one, please. Have we lost David?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. I guess, I feel like I have to ask this question. Your corporate expense line is now more than double where it was five years ago. And I don't think anyone would pay it much attention if it were accompanied with stronger earnings power and a stronger outlook for earnings power going forward based on the environment of the industry and based on the investments you're making in the returns. But today, you're lowering your ROI \u2013 you're essentially lowering your ROIC numbers, which is going to cause several people to have to lower kind of their long-term outlook.","I know you're saying that yours is the same. But can maybe you just give us a sense of, to what extent has the doubling up of the headquarters in Chicago and Decatur affected that? To what extent has rising executive comp affected that and then maybe the more meaningful positive ROI investments in IT and capabilities that will improve the business?","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","Yeah, a significant part of the increase in terms of unallocated corporate on the management line is related to our investments in IT, the business transformation and R&D and innovation. We've indicated that these are \u2013 we view those as related investments. Although again from a GAAP perspective, we classify that as expense. But it's a fairly significant investment. I mean, as you are going to appreciate, one of our priorities is to improve our business processes. And so, we launched this program a couple years ago. And frankly, the run rate of spending as we head into 2017 is actually a fairly significant run rate right now in terms of investments. And so, I think, Rob, that this is actually a very, very important part in terms of our commitment, our investments, in terms of making this company better, particularly in the area of processes.","In the area of innovation, frankly, for a company our size, we were under spending in terms of R&D and innovation. And I think what we're doing right now is actually devoting the more of our spending in that area. So WILD Flavors acquisition was actually very, very important because from that acquisition, we actually acquired a lot of innovation centers around the world. And that type of expense actually goes into this line called unallocated corporate as well.","When you actually take a look at what I call core central staff costs, and when I say core, I mean this is excluding IT, excluding business transformation, excluding R&D. Our core central staff costs actually are still running at what we call the 2012 levels. I mean, if you recall back in 2012, we went through a restructuring of our central staffs. And so we've actually set our budgets and our cost plans based upon ensuring that our, what I call core central staffs, do not exceed the 2012 levels.","And, so, I think it's important to kind of understand that in what I call like true corporate central staff cost, like the functions themselves, like accounting and HR, et cetera, et cetera, we've actually kept a lid on all those costs, where as we have we actually spent more money in terms what I call investments, particularly in business transformation, R&D and innovation. That's where we've seen the increase in. And we think that this is important for this company to make these types of investments at this point in time in order to allow us to be a better company in the future.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks for the color Ray. And the $50 million in run-rate cost savings that you highlight; is that net of this incremental spending in any way or is it just kind of a separate metric?","Ray G. Young - Archer Daniels Midland Co.","That's separate. I mean, that's really related to our operational excellence initiatives there.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

I will now turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Ruth Ann, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. This morning, we reported third quarter net earnings of $399 million or $0.60 per share on a fully diluted basis. Our adjusted EPS was a solid $0.78 per share. Segment operating profit was $887 million. ","We delivered very good results this quarter, despite difficult margin environments, particularly in ethanol and European oilseeds. The strong third quarter last year set a high bar and this quarter represents a solid performance by the ADM team. In the quarter, we continued our efforts to drive shareholder returns. With Wilmar, we finalized our partnership agreements in fertilizer, ocean freight and European tropical oil refining. These are subject to regulatory approval. We began and have substantially completed our global workforce restructuring. We now expect this, combined with other efforts, will result in an annual cash run rate savings in excess of $150 million, up from our prior estimate of $125 million. And we returned $171 million to shareholders this quarter, buying back nearly 2 million shares.","Looking ahead, planting is underway in North America and we are encouraged by the projected corn and soybean acreage. Meanwhile, we will continue to deliver our global origination processing and transportation network to deliver products to our customers and returns to our shareholders.","As Ruth Ann mentioned, before we take your questions today, Ray will discuss a few important changes regarding some of our accounting and reporting. And now, I will turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides some financial highlights for the quarter, which I'll run through briefly. As Pat noted, segment operating profit was a solid $887 million, down from last year's very strong result of $1 billion. Quarterly net earnings were $399 million, down 31% from last year's third quarter. ","Looking at our effective income tax rate fourth quarter, we recorded taxes at 29%, resulting in a cumulative rate of 30%. We continue to believe that 30% is a good estimate for the fiscal year. Our earnings per share were $0.60 on a fully diluted basis compared to last year's $0.86. Adjusting for specified items, including LIFO, ADM earned $0.78 per share compared to last year's $0.89 per share. ","On Chart 19 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year '12 to fiscal year '11. In our standard LIFO adjusted, 4-quarter trailing ROIC of 5.6% was below our WACC by 50 basis points. Excluding other specified items, our adjusted ROIC of 6.9% was above our WACC by 80 basis points.","Slide 6 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Juan will talk about the business segments\u2019 results in his update. Let me touch on a few items of significance in the corporate line. I touched upon LIFO earlier, market prices for our LIFO-based inventories rose in the third quarter, resulting in a charge of $107 million compared to a charge of $43 million last year. Our interest expense is lower due to lower interest rates and lower debt levels. Unallocated corporate costs include the $74 million of restructuring charges, mainly related to our global workforce reduction. Excluding this charge, corporate costs are down year-over-year.","Turning to the cash flow segment on Slide 7, we generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations before working capital changes in the first 9 months of 2012, compared to $2.2 billion in the same period last year. Working capital was a source of cash to us of about $300 million. This includes approximately $1 billion of cash generated from the sale of trade receivables executed during the quarter. Last year, working capital was a significant use of cash of almost $7 billion. ","We made capital investments of $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of 2012. In addition, we spent $239 million in acquisitions of assets. We're on track to spend to our combined target of capital spending and acquisitions of approximately $1.7 billion for this fiscal year. Our net debt decreased by about $100 million during the first 9 months of the year. For the quarter, we returned $171 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. For the first 9 months, we returned $822 million. ","In this quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares, bringing our fiscal year repurchases to 17 million shares. Of the 44 million shares issued in June 2011 related to the equity unit conversion, we have already bought back, to date, 29 million shares. We expect our average shares outstanding for this fiscal year to be approximately 665 million shares.","Slide 8 shows the highlights of our balance sheet. Third quarter cash on hand was approximately $1.2 billion. Our operating working capital was about $15 billion, of which $13 billion was inventories. Total debt was about $10 billion, up slightly from the level at the beginning of the quarter. Total shareholders\u2019 equity stood at about $18.5 billion. ","We had $1.2 billion outstanding in commercial paper, and we had available credit capacity of $3.1 billion in U.S. commercial paper and $1.6 billion in other global credit lines. I also want to note that of the $13 billion of inventories, about $9 billion is readily marketable. ","We believe this strong balance sheet continues to provide us with financial flexibility to manage our business in volatile markets and continue to invest for a profitable growth.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review for the quarter. Juan?","Juan R. Luciano","Thanks, Ray. Good morning to everyone in the call. Beginning on Slide 9, I will take you through the highlights of each of our business segments; then I will provide our current assessment of market conditions and their implications for ADM.","In Oilseeds Processing, our operating profit in the third quarter was $395 million, down $117 million from the same period last year. Last year's third quarter included significant timing gains. Excluding these gains, this year's results were comparable to last year's good results. We also saw sequential improvements in our profits over the course of this fiscal year from an improving margin environment, stronger demand for North American meal and origination opportunities in South America.","Crushing and origination operating profit was $271 million. Improved results in North and South America were more than offset by continued weakness in Europe. Tight South American crop supplies led to increased soybean meal exports from North America. And in South America, favorable positioning and increased farmer selling due to higher crop prices and favorable exchange rates led to good grain origination results. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $75 million for the quarter, down $14 million in weaker biodiesel results from North and South America.","Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were up $31 million over the prior year's third quarter, principally reflecting ADM's share of the results from our equity investee, Wilmar International Ltd. And as Pat mentioned, this quarter, in oilseeds, we finalized partnership agreements with Wilmar in fertilizer, ocean freight and European tropical oil refining. We are working together with Wilmar to prepare for implementation in tropical oils and fertilizers. And in ocean freight, we're contributing our vessels and expect the venture to be operational in May.","Please turn now to Slide 10. As you see, corn processing operating profit was $130 million, a decrease of $74 million from the same period last year. Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $47 million to $93 million. Export demand for sweeteners remained strong, and average selling prices rose as new sweetener contract came into effect through the quarter. ","BioProducts results in the quarter decreased $121 million to $37 million. Ethanol margins remained weak through the quarter amid excess industry production that lessened through the quarter. Results also reflect the $14 million charge related to the closure of ADM's 30 million gallon per year ethanol dry mill at Walhalla, North Dakota. There was also a recovery of $4 million of PHA-related inventories. That's why you see $10 million in restructuring and other exit cost in the bar graph.","Turning to Slide 11, you will see a review of our ag services segment. Operating profit was $179 million, up $8 million from the same period a year ago, and consistent with our recent historical quarterly range of $150 million to $200 million. Merchandising and handling earnings were stable. ADM's Black Sea and other international merchandising operations saw good volumes and margins, while North American grain export volumes were down due to low U.S. crop inventories. Earnings from transportation operations rose $7 million.","On Slide 12, you can see highlights from our other businesses. In the third quarter, profit from ADM's other businesses was $183 million, up $64 million from the same period one year earlier. Excluding net timing effects, the results in other were comparable to last year's results.","In other processing, profits rose $105 million to $201 million. Cocoa results this quarter were impacted by $72 million in mark-to-market net timing gains. The underlying performance in cocoa remained strong, driven by good cocoa press margins. Wheat milling results, including ADM's share of Gruma, were essentially flat. Other financial declined $41 million to a loss of $18 million due to losses at ADM's captive insurance subsidiary related to crop risk and property reserves.","Turning to Slide 13, we want to provide some perspective on current market conditions and their implications for ADM. The South American harvest, while smaller than expected, is improving global soybean supplies as it comes onto the market. That is also reducing demand for meal exports from the U.S., pressure in margins and reducing run rates there. Longer term, global protein meal demand continues to grow and improved capacity utilization should strengthen industry margin structure over time. We're managing our regional processing capacity to better align supply and demand.","In corn processing, poor ethanol margins led to reduced industry production. This has driven a better balance of supply and demand, which should help industry margins. Strong demand for our corn wheat milling portfolio, led by exports of HFCS, has led to good capacity utilization and we expect to see that continue. While farmers in the U.S. are planting expanded corn and soybean acreage, global supplies of those crops should tighten through the North American harvest. And in wheat, we see an ample global supply.","As we move into the summer growing season, ADM will have to carefully manage through the tight supply and commodity price inverse. Now, I will turn the call back to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Juan. As you know, we announced in March a realignment of how we manage our businesses. I want to explain how we will be reporting our segments going forward to line up with how we're managing our businesses.","Going forward, we will report cocoa results as part of a new category in Oilseeds called Cocoa & Others. This category will include our cocoa processing results, as well as the results from our Peanut business and our Cellulose business.","In ag services, we will have a new category called Milling & Other. This category will include the results of our Milling businesses, as well as the results from Alliance Nutrition, Edible Beans and our investment in Gruma. ","Our Other reporting segment will continue to include the results of ADM Investor Services in our captive insurance operations.","Also starting in the fourth quarter, we will move working capital interest expenses from the business segments to the corporate line. Currently, this interest expense is spread among the business units and corporate. This approach is consistent with many other companies. This will effectively move about $20 million to $30 million of interest expense per quarter from the segment operating profit to the corporate expense line.","Lastly, I want to highlight an important change we plan to make relating to fiscal year reporting. As you know, we currently have a June 30 fiscal year end. This was largely driven by the U.S. crop year. As we have become a more global company, the U.S. crop year has less relevance to our financial cycle, and we have a lot more reporting on a statutory basis and tax basis that is tied to the calendar year. Also, many of our business contracts are tied to the calendar year. ","Therefore, to streamline our internal processes and eliminate redundancy and waste, we plan to move to a calendar year fiscal year starting on January 1, 2013. This means that we will have a stub fiscal year from July 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012. This planned change was approved by our audit committee yesterday, and is subject to final approval by our board at its meeting on May 3.","Now let me turn it over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Ray and Juan, and before we take your questions, let me just recap. We had a very good quarter. We saw the value of our diverse global footprint; we remain focused on shareholder value; we expect upwards of $150 million in ongoing savings from our reorganization efforts; and we continue to buy back shares. And as Ray mentioned, we've had some changes in our accounting and reporting.","So Craig will now join Juan, Ray and me for the Q&A. Kristy, could you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just 2 questions. One is, can you talk about the implications of the smaller South American crop on how the trade flow will be out of the U.S. over the next 6 to 12 months, the crush margin outlook for North America and how will it also affect South America?","Juan R. Luciano","Sure, Ken. Yes. This is Juan. What we see this year with the tighter South American crop is that Argentina is the largest exporter of meal. We see the supply from South America being, maybe, 15% smaller. So certainly we have seen a little bit of that -- those supplies push to the U.S., so we've been exporting a little bit more. That's why you see probably we had a little bit better margin than we expected in oilseeds. And we see in that window that traditionally now supplies shift to South America, maybe extending a little bit to the U.S. and also maybe shrinking a little bit over the summer. So we're seeing that as a positive. There may be some implications also from some of the other products in our portfolio, like cotton seeds or other of our oilseed products as people look for alternative to soybean meal. So that's what we see overall. Although it's early, we can see that already in March and April, Ken.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And my second question is on the high-fructose corn syrups side of your business. The hedging, I'm assuming any sort of repercussions from last year are all done. So I'm assuming this is the final quarter that there's any sort of negative mark-to-market or anything going on. So next quarter should be the full economic results of the business.","Juan R. Luciano","That's correct, Ken. Yes.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And how much was the implication this current quarter?","Ray G. Young","It's actually minimal, Ken, on this quarter in our results for this third quarter. As Juan indicated, the contracts rolled in over the course of the third quarter. And so effectively, the residual impact of all the hedging we've done last year, it\u2019s basically washed through.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So this is actually the right run rate then in the current quarter?","Juan R. Luciano","I would say, Ken, during this quarter, we were still implementing the price increases. Some of our contracts were -- have implementations based on maybe February or late February. So I will say probably next quarter will be a true reflection of the new contract being implemented with the new prices.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So wanted to just talk about E15 a little bit, Pat. And we've seen -- I don't know, there's been press articles out there recently talking about how Toyota has gas caps that they started to put on. I think last year that says it's got a big x mark through E15 and E85 on the bulk of their vehicles. And Ford publicly states that it doesn't support E15 in its legacy vehicles. What do you make of this resistance from the automakers in the adoption of E15? So that's kind of the first question on ethanol.","Patricia A. Woertz","Juan's becoming our E15 expert here so I'm going to let him remark on that.","Juan R. Luciano","David, listen, this -- I think first of all, the implementation of E15 is certainly important for us in the long term. I don't think we should see a lot of that being impacting our numbers in this calendar year. And I've been through implementations of these things in different countries. I remember I landed in Brazil when they were talking to ethanol flex fuels and all that. And you always hear all kind of concerns at the beginning. But at the end of the day, economic rationale prevails. At this point in time, with all the governments having so much budgetary issues, you have ethanol having $1 advantage over gasoline. I think it's something that implementation will happen. I think all the stakeholders in all these wants to make sure that all the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed before they launch into these. So we're working with all the constituents through our associations to make sure everybody\u2019s comfortable. But I think that people are bringing up issues and we try to bring some science and solve those issues to give comfort to the people. So it's a long process. But I think if you look from our previous call into this call, we made a steady progress and steps continue to be completed. So we feel that -- we continue to feel that you're going to see some E15 on gas stations probably by the summer. And probably you will see maybe a little bit more of a financial impact in the industry and our business probably in 2013.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on ethanol. So margins, just by our calculations, continue to remain very weak. I noticed here you guys have closed a small dry mill. Do you see significant capacity closures going on this time? Can you frame up what you have been seeing industry-wide in U.S. ethanol?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, David. We probably saw -- as you pointed out, we shut down a small plant, mostly because we want to continue to improve our competitive position. We don't think it's going to make a big dent into the industry. It was probably 1.5% of our own capacity. But I think, from an industry perspective, we've seen like probably 14, 15 plants coming down. Part of that is the maintenance, the schedule that they are in. But part of that is we believe that these plants will have difficulties getting their hands on corn for the next couple months. I think people tend to have maybe 30 days of coverage, so we expect some time in May people start running out of that. So we expect that cycle to perform like last year, in which we see this decline in margins, people having difficulty getting to old crop corn and then shut down capacity and supply and demand matches, and then we see the expansion in margins. We haven't seen that yet, to be honest. So we will see probably that later in this quarter, full effect probably next quarter.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So June quarter\u2019s still tough; the quarter after that maybe partially tough but improving?","Juan R. Luciano","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christina McGlone of Deutsche Bank.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question on the cost savings. For the $150 million for the global workforce reduction, did you realize any this quarter or does it start really in the June quarter now?","Ray G. Young","Yes, Christina. Yes, basically, we implement it over the course of this third quarter. So we'll start really seeing the benefits flow through in the fourth quarter. We won't see the full benefits until, really, March 31, 2013, because some of the reductions and retirements will occur over the course of this particular period.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But it will help the June quarter somewhat?","Ray G. Young","Yes. That's correct.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then I think there was some confusion on the Analyst Day. With the Wilmar joint venture, I think the savings were $30 million to $40 million per year. And I wasn't -- we weren't sure if that was ADM share or the total share? And then with that, when will we start to see that?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, Christina, this is Juan. That's probably the ADM share that we described of those savings. And that probably will happen -- that will be a run rate probably in a couple of quarters. We're still in the process of filing our approvals on all that. So we have signed with them and some parts like ocean freight has started because we have started some elements of the optimization in fertilizers, but the big chunk of it will probably take 30 to 60 days to be implemented.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then for BioProducts in the quarter, it was better than I expected. And I'm just curious, did you make money in ethanol in the quarter or was that the lysine and other immunoacids that made up for a weak ethanol?","Juan R. Luciano","I think, Christina, ethanol margins were tough, but we always talk about the strength of our cost position and we being better than the industry, our integration. And I think the strength of our wet milling portfolio, don't forget we have also some feed specialties, some food specialties there, we have a good quarter on lysine. So all that contributes.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, just building on Ken Zaslow's. And when you talk about -- if we think about the fall and we don't have a South American tail to compete with, so you would think U.S. crush margins would improve. But given the price of soybean meal, do you think it's pricing itself out of rations? I mean how do you look at soybean meal demand even as we head into new harvest?","Juan R. Luciano","During the quarter, we actually saw good demand both for exports and domestic. I think as we saw it later in the quarter, with soybean\u2019s rally against corn, we saw a little bit of the opposite what you are describing. So we're constantly looking at these transitions, if you will. But at this point in time into the Q4, we're still seeing probably better demand for North America than we will expect for this time of the year. So the seasonality seems a little bit better for us this year than last year, probably reflecting the weakness in South America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One is you mentioned that you will be eliminating some redundancies by shifting to a calendar year. Can you help us quantify what those savings are and are they already in your $150 million corporate savings target? And then secondly, Europe, you mentioned Europe was weak. You just had an Analyst Day in Europe. Can you give us a sense of what needs to change in Europe in order for conditions to get better? And actually I have a follow-up on ethanol if I could.","Ray G. Young","Rob, it's Ray. For the purposes of your modeling, you can assume that some of the cost savings are already in our run rate that we provided to you. Frankly speaking, there's a lot of intangible benefits of improving processes that are not quantifiable. And then, frankly, as we implement this, we'll see other benefits flow through. But I think for your purposes of your modeling, I think it's safe just to use the run rate savings that we provided to you.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Europe?","Juan R. Luciano","I will take Europe, Rob, this is Juan. Margins continues to be under pressure in Europe as oil values remain depressed. Basically, biodiesel demand has been very low during the quarter, mostly due to extremely cold temperatures that we experience. So as result of this, the market continues to work through the oil inventories. So we expecting we're going to the fourth quarter, we're taking several measures. We're taking some of our -- we adjust some of our capacity. We have shifted part of our capacity from rapes to soy as we see soy margins, crushing margins a little bit better, since there is a smaller crop in South America offering some support there. Obviously, we can only do this for a part of our operations. And also, diesel demand is expected to rebound on weather improvement and probably increase tourism this time of the year. So we expect some improvement in margins still being tough. You know that the rapeseed crop there is at a 6-year low, if you will. So we're going to continue to see pressure in rapes -- in getting rapeseed seeds. But as I said from a market perspective, we expect a slight improvement.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just a follow-up. I was talking to an industry participant in U.S. ethanol, and he said that his outlook for exports is a lot higher because of the values here, the corn ethanol values have come down so much and it's now more economical. Can you tell us what your outlook is for exports to Brazil and other countries?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. We've been working, obviously, since last year on developing export programs. And they take a while; obviously, you need some qualifications and all that. We haven't seen the uptick that we wanted so far. We are still hopeful that they will improve, but we haven't seen that yet. The economic incentive is there, certainly, but there seems to be needing a little bit more than just the economic incentive for this to happen right now.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Juan, do you think total industries will be flat versus Europe or do you think it will be down a little bit?","Juan R. Luciano","I think the view is about 800 million gallons, something in that range for the year.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","For this year. So down versus a year ago.","Juan R. Luciano","A little bit down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to get some help on the quantification of your positions in the quarter. You noted sort of a benefit in your origination in the oilseeds. And then just a little bit of clarity on the cocoa because I know in those last couple of quarters, you've had obviously a big negative mark-to-market. You regained some of that in the third quarter. I think there's probably still a little bit more to go in the fourth quarter. But if you could just help me kind on where you are position-wise, obviously without giving out your book but just kind of how it impacted your third quarter within grains, origination, within the oilseeds and then also the cocoa, that would be helpful.","Ray G. Young","Diane, it's Ray here. We did indicate that we did have some positioning, positive positioning benefits in our results. If you recall in Hamburg when we met, we provided some level of indication where we were in the quarter. As it turned out, March ended up stronger than we had thought when we met in Hamburg. And part of it is due to the fact that in South America origination, good volumes and actually some good positioning down there. We had some good positioning in North American softseeds as well. And with respect to cocoa in terms of the mark-to-market timing effect. If you recall in the last quarterly call, we indicated there was about $100 million of negative -- accumulated negative mark-to-market that would unwind over the course of the future. The net timing affect that we identified in this quarter was approximately $70 million. So if you do the mathematics, then there's still about $30 million of cumulative negative mark-to-market impacts that will unwind in the future. And again, it's going to unwind in the future, the timing to be determined, Diane.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Sure. Well it seems to me that you had been working to restructure something within that operation, the accounting around it so that it wouldn't be as volatile in the future. So I guess my question is if you think you can get it wrapped up in the fourth quarter here as we move into your next fiscal year, which I appreciate will now be a stub year, but can we expect that business line to be a little less volatile or do you have the same sort of issues going forward just is in terms of the volatility?","Ray G. Young","I guess we've made a lot of progress in terms of dampening a lot of these accounting impacts over the past year, whether it be the oilseeds timing effect, I think we've mitigated that. We've mitigated somewhat the corn hedging as well by using a lot more hedge accounting there. The last piece, frankly speaking, is this cocoa mark-to-market timing effect. And I think we're positively encouraged that come the first quarter of the next fiscal year, that we will be able to mitigate that as well. And we're still working on that, we're finalizing it. But Diane, hopefully, as we start off the new fiscal year, you won't hear me talk about mark-to-market timing effects as much or at all in terms of our future results.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to ask you about global meal demand. I think you've had some positive comments here, but could you talk about, in particular, Asia and then sort of what you're seeing with the North American industry, which has been sort of in caught mode now for some time. Are you starting to see some movement towards any expansion there?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, Diane. This is Juan. Asia, we've seen China continue to have this appetite for more meal. I think imports have been up like 20% this calendar year versus last calendar year. And we've seen, as I said in my remarks, in North America, expanded demand both in exports and we've been exporting to several countries, Philippines, Poland, several countries in the first quarter of this calendar year, and also domestic demand. So I think overall, was a very good quarter from a demand perspective. And so we continue to see the global trend of 3% to 4%, whatever you want to call it. But we\u2019re seeing that impacting North America this time.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just to the extent that we've seen a shift in the acreage base from soy into corn this year, are you concerned at all about sort of supplies in the fall on the soybean side?","Craig E. Huss","This is Craig, I'll take that. I think obviously...","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","It\u2019s a long way to go. I appreciate that.","Craig E. Huss","Yes. We've got up to 96 million acres of corn coming. We have obviously changed the corn ratio dramatically over the last few months, and I think that you'll see some leakage to beans there. And we're 2 or 3 weeks ahead on our wheat crop. That's also dependent on how dry we are going into wheat harvest. But we could see another potentially million acres of beans come back to us there. But, yes, we're very concerned about it. But we also -- when you get to dislocations, it provides opportunities.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, maybe it's more of a philosophical question. Would you rather have the acreage in corn because that benefits your Corn Processing division or would you rather have acreage in soy so that you can keep your plants at some optimal level of processing?","Craig E. Huss","I think we'd prefer margins.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","However you get them.","Patricia A. Woertz","Yes.","Craig E. Huss","It doesn't matter what we prefer, actually. We just got to deal with what we get. But at this point we have a very big corn number and we'll see -- we're going to see some leakage from that into beans and we'll also see some additional acres come into the beans from double cropping. They won't know that until they get the wheat out of the field.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple questions on, first, on China. I understand you're not necessarily as close to this market as some of your other businesses. But are you hearing anything related to price controls on vegetable oil or specifically, soybean oil in that market and is that having any bearing on industry dynamics there?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. We've seen what happened before when there were some price controls. Obviously, crushing margins were reduced. Then crushing margins lately has been expanding on relatively stable soybean prices, and the deliveralization of price controls on oils. Now we hear again about price controls. So we expect that will have an impact in margins, potentially shrinking them again, yes.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Are there spillover effects? Obviously, the crushers in China would get hurt, but in terms of just Chinese demand for soybeans and just generally global trade flows, that would also be impacted.","Juan R. Luciano","I think China has always been very hungry for beans and it's also very hungry for corn. I think they're also very strategic buyers. So I think, potentially, it could hurt the demand for beans, yes, if they are not making any money in the crushing until that corrects itself, yes.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow-up on Rob's question on ethanol exports. Clearly, the economic incentives are there. So in your opinion, what are the other obstacles to exporting more ethanol?","Juan R. Luciano","Well, I think the big customer in all this is Brazil. And Brazil had adjusted, obviously. They are blending rates back to 20% and now they're thinking whether to do it in 21% or 25%. I think they are dealing with their whole supply-demand issues in the sugar industry. And so I don't know exactly why they haven't opened the doors to really advantages, ethanol imports. But we're working together with our team in Brazil and certainly with -- commercially with Petrobras and all that. So we're making the product available and hopefully that will turn out soon.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you're not optimistic that you could expand ethanol exports to other countries outside of Brazil?","Juan R. Luciano","Well, we've been working. We've been working in Japan and several other countries where we'd send samples and we are approval process Canada, too. So there is, I mean, obviously, with the dollar under gasoline, there is a lot of activity and a lot of interest. It just haven't materialized yet in sales. But certainly our teams are working on that.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got you. And then lastly, another announcement about some industry consolidation close to your home turf. Do you have any thoughts on whether we're at the front of some sort of broader consolidation activity or if there's any implication from some of the combinations we've seen of late?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, I think, in general, we could say that the industry is always active. And depending on what part of the region or what part of the world you look at, we're obviously looking ourselves. And things that would make sense for us strategically and meet our hurdle rates, et cetera, we look at. So broadly speaking, I think the world continues to get -- obviously, has a need for our products, needs for more food, more energy and companies look at the opportunities to do that more broadly and on a global scale.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I have a question about just whether low grain inventories are good or bad or indifferent for you. So obviously, soybeans benefited, but corn origination in the merchandising segment was hurt by low grain inventories. So I guess can you help us think about that? I guess as long as things are lower somewhere else, that's okay for you like what happened in soybeans. So U.S. is low but Latin America was even lower in terms of inventories?","Patricia A. Woertz","I think there are 2 different things to look at. One, low inventory and what it does to the margin environment. And as we see a dislocation in Argentina, we think it brings value to us. When you bring it back to the states, where we have a great deal of storage, you will look at a different thing, and that is what is -- if we have large crops and big carries, it's a tool. It's a moneymaking tool for us. So we obviously look at, for example, the big corn crop as an opportunity going forward to bring returns. The tight soybeans that we look forward to next year, we hope will bring margins. But again, it takes away from that ability to store. So it's both sides, the margins and then the storage that we have and the ability to get returns from carries in the market.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Secondly, Ray, the weighted average return on capital continued to drift down. It was actually underneath the cost of capital in the current quarter. With the recent shift to short-term capital spending projects that have quick paybacks, is that -- we're going to start to see that slip here in the next quarter?","Ray G. Young","Yes. I mean I think there's been a lot of focus on our capital returns. I think that when you take a look at our spread over WACC I mean that's -- again, a 4-quarter trailing average number. Again, the reported number, if you recall also includes the restructuring charges. So therefore we look at the adjusted number in order to exclude the restructuring charges. So that's still above WACC. But I agree. We've seen some compression in terms of that particular spread. I think it's fair to say that we've got good capital discipline. I think Juan has talked a lot about that. And we're confident that if we execute the way we want to execute, that will get this spread back up to our long-term target of 200 basis points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","We were positively surprised by your results in oilseeds, crushing and origination. And I'm just curious how that compared versus your internal expectations. And then also are there any other capacity factors coming out of that business?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes, Ann. This is Juan. I will say, probably, March was a little bit better than we expected. By the time we normally go to March, we forecast that there is a shift to South American supply. And probably this year, demand remains stronger for the U.S. As I said, mostly in export, that was the biggest, probably, surprise. And then also, we seen in March the fact that with the real and the dollar relationship, the farmers in Brazil were much more willing sellers. And I think that, that increased obviously grain sales in Brazil. So our origination which is reporting under oilseeds in Brazil had probably had a better March than we were expecting, too.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then anymore capacity coming out that you've heard of in North America, I should say?","Juan R. Luciano","No. Actually, at the moment, everybody's running pretty happy.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just refresh me where you are with global asset review. Are you pretty much done with that intense review or where we are we in that process?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. We're always reviewing. But I will say the bulk of it, we've done it already.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine McCracken of Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just in terms of your comments on corn supplies possibly affecting ethanol volumes. Have you seen any impact from corn quality issues on overall availability of corn or basis levels in general? Maybe you can comment on the possible impact of that.","Craig E. Huss","Christine, this is Craig. No, I don't think quality has come into the picture yet. There's a dislocation this year that is, as the crop is more in the West and in the Northwest. And we think some of the Eastern plants may have some issues and some of the destination plants could have some issues. But there's a degree of corn ownership, as Juan mentioned earlier, probably 30 days. And from that point, as you read the basis levels are very high. And as we invert these markets, it makes it very difficult. And then when you get any kind of flat price breaks, we see export demand come in, and that tends to give more competition for those Eastern and Central plants, as they draw the same corn that the ethanol plants are trying to purchase.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. That make sense. And then just in terms of soy, if you look at balance sheet there, I suspect that things are going to get awfully tight there. I'm wondering could you see a similar slowdown on the crushing side or is that already baked in?","Craig E. Huss","Well, again, it's what type of ownership we have and the industry owns. And there's some ownership out there, but it's going to be difficult to buy beans going forward. And we will see a reduction in exports as South America will rationalize what they have and we\u2019ll go forward. But we're surprised that we've gone 45 to 60 days further than we thought we would and continue to see demand going forward, as South America will figure they may carry their beans longer and if there's a carry in the market. So it's just an ongoing process and the fact what the margin environment is going forward.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","And just tied to that in terms of -- you commented briefly I guess on the oil demand in Europe. As we look at the meal demand in Europe and obviously, things are a little stronger maybe here and in Asia. But in Europe, it seems like with this animal -- shift in animal health policies and a move way from crates, you could see a pretty significant reduction in overall animal numbers there. I'm just curious if you expect that to shift either export demand into Europe or their European crushing in general?","Juan R. Luciano","No, Christina...","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","This the ban on the crates and the pretty significant shift in hog numbers that we're seeing.","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. But we haven't seen that yet. But yes, it's something that we are analyzing as a potential scenario that can impact us, but we haven't seen it yet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ian Horowitz of Topeka Capital Markets.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Quick question. You guys mentioned strength in North American meal demand. I'm not sure how much it could be, but can you comment, what do you think the demand increase was attributable to the DDG declines due to reduced crush?","Juan R. Luciano","I think, Ian, for us, domestic meal demand basically increases as higher corn prices supported meal inclusion in the formulation. So part is DDGs are obviously not growing anymore from year to year, so they are flat. But also when corn rally, I mean, all these meals make it into the rations. So we saw little bit of that combination. Remember, we have a team here that looks at feed from all the different angles. So we constantly are looking at what is the best thing to position based on our margins and our availability.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I know it's a little early in the year and we're all trying to look out a little bit, but can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on 2013 with ethanol policy? It seems like with current gasoline demand, and who knows where it's going to be in 2013, and an E10 -- overall, an E10 kind of market, I know that there's a potential for some marginally 15. How do you achieve the 13.8 billion gallons of consumption for obligated parties?","Juan R. Luciano","Well, obviously, I mean this is a combination, Ian, of factors. Difficult to know where the driving months are going to be. But if we look at the forecast, they are stable or declining. So we're working hard on both things and E15 implementation and certainly developing export markets that I explained before. That's why our commercial team is working. The mandate is obviously expanding to 13.8. So on capacity, when everything runs, is something we've proven it's like 14.7. So what we need to get is that extra billion gallon, if you will, of exports or E15 combination. And then that's probably going to do it for us.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But that's in terms of capacity utilization. But in terms of meeting the -- it seems like meeting the RFS obligation could pose quite a challenge for domestic-obligated parties. Do you seem to disagree, Juan?","Juan R. Luciano","Say it again?","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I mean, I understand exports will help in the utilization rates of the plants, but in terms of actually meeting domestic obligations for the RFS...","Juan R. Luciano","You're talking about the blend grow basically.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Juan R. Luciano","And that's what we said, Ian, we need both the export and E15 to get there.","Ian Horowitz - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But exports don't allow you to satisfy internal domestic...","Juan R. Luciano","I'm just saying for us to get to profitability, we need E15 to clear the blend wall or we need bigger exports so we can run at capacity, yes.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","And Juan, would you expect to see E15 at a measurable volume by 2013?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. We think so. We think this year will be, as I said, not very relevant. It will be an introduction. But I think by next year, yes. If this benefit continues to be there, I think we will see an accelerated implementation. It will make sense.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Case McGee, Vice President, Investor Relations for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. McGee, you may begin.","Case McGee","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we are webcasting this presentation on our website, adm.com. The replay will also be available at that address.","For those following the presentation today, please turn to Slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results. And our Chief Operating Officer, Juan Luciano, will review the drivers of our operations' performance, provide an update on key accomplishments in 2013 and discuss some of the factors that will influence results in the first quarter and throughout 2014. Then they will take your questions.","Please now turn to Slide 3. I will turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Case, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net earnings of $374 million or $0.56 per share on a diluted basis. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.95. Segment operating profit was just over $1 billion, while -- and when excluding specified items.","I'm very proud of the team as they delivered a strong finish to the year. Lower corn costs and improved ethanol margins helped to support a significant improvement in our Corn business. Our great Oilseeds performance was driven by our ability to meet robust global demand for meal and by improved biodiesel results in both North America and Europe. However, our Ag Services business was impacted by the slow U.S. farmer-selling of corn and challenges in our international merchandising.","Looking back on the year, the team made meaningful progress on our efforts to improve costs, cash and capital management. We are ahead of schedule in our cost-saving efforts. We've completed our 2-year program to unlock cash from our balance sheet. We carefully managed capital spending in 2013 and announced a balanced capital plan for 2014.","Looking ahead, we continue to see strong global demand for our products and large global crop supplies. We expect continued good utilization of our North American network until South America's large harvest reaches global markets.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter and the calendar year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.95 per share compared to $0.60 last year. Excluding specified items, segment operating profit was over $1 billion, up 33% compared to last year. The effective tax rate for the calendar year was 33% compared to 30% in the prior year. This year's calendar rate was negatively impacted by valuation allowances on various deferred tax assets and a shift in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by some favorable income tax adjustments related to U.S. biodiesel tax credits. Excluding these factors, the effective tax rate for the calendar year was 30%. And for 2014, the company's planning its effective tax rate at around 30%.","Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.6% was slightly below our WACC of 6.7%. During the fourth quarter, the 6.6% adjusted ROIC reflected an improvement of 90 basis points from the third quarter adjusted ROIC. But the fourth quarter WACC of 6.7% was also up by 50 basis points from the third quarter and 140 basis points from last year at the same time due to a combination of higher interest rates and a stronger ADM stock price. As we expected, the ROIC versus WACC spread turned solidly positive in the fourth quarter, with a static quarterly spread well in excess of 200 basis points, driven primarily by improvement in earnings.","On Chart 18 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of reported quarterly earnings of $0.56 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.95 per share, as well as a reconciliation for the calendar year. For this quarter, LIFO was immaterial.","After-tax charges related to GrainCorp of $167 million or $0.25 per share included $155 million of impairment as we marked our remaining 19.8% investment to the December 31 value and $12 million in after-tax expenses related to unwinding FX hedges on the planned share acquisition and GrainCorp transaction-related fees. Asset impairment charges of $0.11 per share were recognized related to a variety of asset write-downs, including an impairment of $0.08 per share related to our investment in a Brazilian sugar mill.","We had a series of tax adjustments that included a charge of $0.12 per share related to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and a favorable income tax adjustment of $0.13 per share resulting from a ruling regarding the income tax treatment of U.S. biodiesel blenders credits earned in prior quarters back to 2011. And we had an unfavorable quarterly tax rate adjustment of $0.03 per share related to truing up the previous quarters' lower tax rates to our final fiscal year rate, which was higher.","For the calendar year 2013, we finished with reported EPS of $2.02 and adjusted EPS of $2.33. Our adjusted EPS was slightly higher than the 2012 calendar year number of $2.30.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. I would like to highlight some unique or specified items in the operating results before Juan talks about the segment results. Juan's discussions will exclude the specified [ph] items so that you can understand the underlying trends in the business.","In the Oilseeds segment, mark-to-market timing effects in cocoa resulted in charges of approximately $20 million for the quarter versus about $5 million in the same quarter last year.","In the Corn segment, we're separating out corn hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses. For this fourth quarter, hedge ineffectiveness losses we had in prior quarters reversed themselves, and we brought into results $25 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains. By the way, for adjusted EPS, we have never treated corn hedge ineffectiveness as an adjustment item in the past nor we -- did we treat it as an adjustment item in this fourth quarter.","In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of both pretax and after-tax of about $50 million related to our Brazilian sugar mill based upon an updated assessment of the future cash flows of this investment. And there were also some minor impairments recorded on U.S. assets as well.","In the Ag Services segment, adjusted results excluded $155 million of GrainCorp impairment charges in this fourth quarter compared to a $62 million gain related to our share acquisitions through a total return swap structure in last year's fourth quarter.","Now let me touch on a few items of significance in the corporate line. In the fourth quarter, interest expense was lower due to lower borrowings. Unallocated corporate costs were up due to some higher year-end accruals differences and higher share-based compensation expenses. Other charges of $57 million in the fourth quarter include the loss on the FX hedges on GrainCorp and some miscellaneous charges in Europe and North America. By the way, of the $57 million, about $40 million was treated as an adjustment item for adjusted EPS. Prior to cost allocations, our total corporate SG&A expenses for calendar year 2013 were comparable to calendar year 2012 after we take into account the unique items.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. We present here the cash flow statement for the 12 months ending December 31, 2013, compared to same period the prior year. We generated $2.3 billion from operations before working capital changes in the 12 months ending December 2013 compared to $2.4 billion last year.","Working capital changes were a source of $2.9 billion of cash in the period compared to last year, when they were near 0. Total capital spending for the 12 months was at $913 million, and acquisitions amounted to $44 million, for a total spend of $957 million, slightly below our planned target of $1 billion and lower than our 2012 spend of $1.3 billion.","After changes in working capital and investments, our free cash flow for fiscal year 2013 was over $4 billion compared to $1 billion in 2012. Our cash flows in 2013 benefited from lower commodity prices and our focus on cash flow generation. Lower commodity prices represented about $1.6 billion of cash flow generation in calendar year 2013. With strong cash flows, we're able to reduce strongs on our working capital lines, such as commercial paper borrowings.","We did not repurchase shares during the fourth quarter as we were blacked out due to the GrainCorp transaction and then, subsequently, the development of our 2014 capital plan.","With respect to our capital plan, in December, we announced a dividend increase of 26%, from $0.19 a share to $0.24 per share, that will be payable starting on March 13, 2014, and the intent to repurchase 18 million shares by the end of 2014 that would totally offset the remaining equity unit dilution plus dilution from benefit plan issuances in 2013 and 2014. This is part of our balanced capital allocation strategy, where in 2014 we plan to return to shareholders about $1.4 billion in the form of dividends and share buybacks and reinvest $1.4 billion into the business in the form of capital spending and small M&As. We finished out the quarter with an average of 663 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31 for both 2013 and 2012. Cash on hand was approximately $3.6 billion, up about $1.3 billion from the prior year. Our operating working capital was slightly below $11 billion, down from the $14 billion level last year or a reduction of $3 billion. Of this reduction, about $400 million was related to lower quantity of inventory. Total debt was about $6.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $3.3 billion, down significantly from the 2012 level of $7.3 billion. Our shareholders' equity of $20.2 billion is slightly over $1 billion higher than the level last year.","Our ratio of net debt to total capital, that is excluding cash from gross debt, is 14%, much improved from the December 31, 2012, level of 27%. Our focus on capital efficiency and generating cash from the assets is translating into a strong balance sheet as well.","We had $6.6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December as we reduced our revolving credit facilities by $2 billion due to the strength of our balance sheet and the lack of need due to the GrainCorp acquisition not moving forward. If you add available cash with access to slightly over $10 billion of liquidity at the end of the calendar year, we'd clearly have a balance sheet that is strong enough to support the 2014 capital plan that was announced in December, plus support any strategic M&A opportunities that may present itself in the future.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Thank you, Ray, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I will start with segment operating profit on Slide 8 and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments.","In the fourth quarter, the team delivered improved profit overall. We had some record performances and also identified some areas for aggressive improvements. Our underlying segment operating profit was up by more than 1\/3 year-over-year and up more than 60% sequentially. For the full year, segment operating profit was up over the prior year. This was a challenging year but a productive one. And we are restarting to see the results of the team's effort over the past few years to improve our earnings power.","Slide 9, please, starting with the Oilseeds team, who continue their strong performance with very good results in both South and North America. In North America, strong export and domestic demand drove excellent soybean crushing capacity utilization and good margins. In Brazil, our soybean processing operations saw good volumes and margins, and we exported a lot of corn. Our Paraguay crushing plant ran hard and very well. North American biodiesel delivered a solid performance with good volumes. And in Europe, the mild winter led to higher-than-normal biodiesel demand.","Our food-ingredient business saw strong results across multiple product lines, with our lecithin and protein specialties businesses delivering record years. Cocoa results were essentially flat as the underlying business has improved.","In the 2013 calendar year, a number of businesses within the Oilseeds unit set profit and volume records. The team drove growth of higher-margin businesses, expanded geographically and realigned several groups to improve returns and better serve customers.","Slide 10. The Corn Processing team delivered a strong improvement sequentially and over the year-ago quarter. In our ethanol business, lower corn costs, higher U.S. gasoline demand and strong exports supported lower industry inventories and higher margins. We continue to actively manage our production levels to maximize margins and kept advancing our cost-management efforts. In sweeteners and starches, volumes were seasonally solid, and net corn costs improved significantly.","In the 2013 calendar year, the Corn team drove a lot of improvements in the ethanol business, implementing cost-management projects, reducing inventories and enhancing risk management. The renewal of chemicals business earned record profits as well and grew their customer base by 50%. This remains a small business but one that has seen steady growth.","Moving on to Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, with the North American harvest, Ag Services improved sequentially, but results were lower than our expectations. We saw strong U.S. exports, with November setting an all-time record at our New Orleans terminals. But 3 years of low stocks and recent lower corn prices meant U.S. farmers held onto more of their corn crop than usual, causing bases to remain at historic highs for the fourth quarter. A lower wheat carries also reduced merchandising income. In international merchandising, we saw higher volumes, but merchandising and execution issues really hurt profitability. Transportation results were essentially flat, but good volumes in October were offset by the normal winter weather challenges later in the quarter. Milling performed well, rounding out 4 strong quarters.","2013 was a tough year for the merchandising and handling team. The U.S. team carefully managed the inverse as the U.S. harvest arrived, and they handled large volumes at a number of locations this fall. The performance of our international merchandising business this year was disappointing, so we are implementing aggressive actions to improve results. We're focusing on execution, costs and people. We may not see the impact next quarter, but we're going to stay on top of this, and we're committed to turn it around.","As we close out 2013, I wanted to update you on some of our key accomplishments during the year. This is at Slide 12. We remain ahead of schedule in our cost-management efforts. By focusing on technology and standardization, we are more than halfway to our goal of an additional $200 million in cost reductions by the end of 2014. Part of our cost effort is linked with our sustainability initiatives, which include a commitment to a 15% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. We are well ahead of plan in that effort. And it's in energy markets like these that our investments in energy efficiency are particularly important.","In cash, we allot more than $2 billion from our balance sheet between 2012 and the first half of 2013. And in doing so, we elevated the organization's focus on cash generation. We see our cost and cash efforts reflected in our very strong balance sheet.","And in capital, we carefully managed our CapEx, investing $957 million in 2013. We also enhanced our commitment to return capital to shareholders. And later this year, we will share with you look-back analysis of some of our past capital investments. Some of the projects we advanced or completed in 2013 included a biodiesel refinery in Canada, our soybean processing facility in Paraguay and a port facility in Northern Brazil. For 2014, we expect to invest about $1.4 billion in CapEx. To give you some context of how this CapEx will be allocated, around $400 million will go towards maintenance, around $100 million will be associated with our ERP project, and the remaining $900 million will be allocated to costs and growth capital projects. More than 60% of gross capital will be targeted outside of the U.S.","And finally, we want to discuss some of the factors we think will influence our business in both the first quarter and throughout 2014. World crop supplies, as we discussed last year, the world will have record supplies of corn, oilseeds and wheat. These large supplies will present an opportunity for us to utilize our global storage and transportation assets. They will mean lower cost inputs for our processing operations, and they will make all of our products more competitive versus substitutes.","The timing of our U.S. farmer corn sales. How the U.S. farmer decides to market the corn crop will impact merchandising results for our Ag Services business. We're seeing some increase in farmer corn movement in Q1.","We're also going to be watching the South American harvest. The last couple of years, logistical challenges have limited the industry's ability to move crops from farms to the world markets. Last year, delays made South American soybeans and meal less competitive globally, reducing exports. This year, we are better prepared for what looks to be a big soybean crop in Brazil.","U.S. biofuel dynamics. The biodiesel blenders credit expired at the end of 2013, and the EPA has proposed holding the biodiesel mandate steady in 2014. Lower biodiesel demand could result in some softening of vegetable oil demand. The EPA has also proposed lowering the ethanol obligation for 2014. They are currently considering comments on their proposed rule. We will be disappointed if the government stepped back from their support of this program. Overall, ethanol blending economics remains strong. That should drive some continued expansion of both E15 and E85. Ethanol export competitiveness will depend somewhat on corn prices, but, by and large, U.S. ethanol remains a very low-cost transportation fuel source.","The continued growth of some of our smaller businesses. We continue to see opportunities to expand some of our higher-margin businesses, including renewal, chemicals and specialty food ingredients. As Pat mentioned, we see global growth demand for our products. The team will use our global network to deliver for our customers and our shareholders.","Pat?","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Juan. So just to summarize the quarter, adjusted earnings at $0.95 per share; lower corn costs helped to drive improvements in Corn; Oilseeds had a lot of success around the world; and Ag Services, both with slow farmer-selling and international merchandising, had some challenges. For the year, real progress on costs, cash and capital management. And looking ahead, we have a balanced capital plan for 2014, a stellar balance sheet, large crops, good demand, lots of needs to serve.","So with that, operator, if you could please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","My first question is around the Ag Services segment. Juan, you mentioned that it was somewhat disappointing compared to the large crop that came in this quarter, and you're placing some initiatives in place to kind of rectify that going forward. Can you be more specific on what you think needs to be done in the merchandising and handling business to kind of get back to those normalized margins that we've seen in the past? And how much of this is a timing issue versus a structural change in on-farm storage and really preventing the commercial guys to capture some of that historical carry trade?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Thank you, Tim, for the question. Let me split this in 2 parts, if you will: the grain business and the international merchandising. Overall, Ag Services performed in the lower side -- on the lower end of the range. I mean, when we give a range of maybe $200 million to $250 million, we're hitting the $200 million when you look at adjusted earnings. So lower end of the range, if you give me -- let me give you the 2 reasons. The grain business, the impact on the grain business, mostly on the slow farmer-selling, that I will consider mostly a delay. We saw last year the same thing in South America in the first quarter, and I called that as a delay, then we saw the recovery during the rest of the year. So we think that probably will come to market. We don't believe that in-store -- in-farm storage represents a significant shift. We're still going to see the crop flowing through our assets. And again, that part, you should consider partly a delay. International merchandising was different. It was an issue of performance during the quarter. We had some geographic arbitrage that didn't go our way. And we had some execution issues, whether it was in Brazil or Argentina or Ukraine or China. We have several issues going against us. So we have launched a significant review of our operations. We have taken some of our experts from here, the headquarters, and we've reviewed some of the procedures that we have in the rest of the world, and we even have replaced some personnel. So we have a very aggressive plan in place for this quarter not to be repeated itself. So again summarizing, one, mostly a delay; second is we stumbled, and we will correct that.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it's fair to say that once you rectify the situation in the international component and farmers start selling again, there's no reason why you couldn't get back into sell at $200 million to $250 million range based on the size of the crop?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I agree with your thinking, Tim.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question on the corn sweeteners segment. We've obviously seen some of the industry data around some of the pricing resets. How would you quantify how your negotiations proceeded? Were they kind of in line with some of the industry data that we've seen or have they been a little bit better than expectations?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, although we haven't closed any -- every single negotiation, so this is a preliminary view, at this point in time, we see stable volumes for North America and declining volumes from Mexico. That's putting some pressure on pricing in this negotiating season.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. So is it a little bit worse than what you were expecting a few months ago, even though corn input costs [indiscernible]?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think, Tim, that on a pricing perspective, pricing are obviously a little bit weaker, responding to this supply-demand dynamics. Obviously, we -- that will be partially offset by lowering corn costs and our management of our footprint and our product mix. But going in, initially, pricing a little bit weaker than we thought.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ray, just one quick comment for you. It's kind of a request or plea. We need a schedule in the press release that has both pretax and post-tax dollars for all of your charges and where they go. That was a nightmare this morning trying to figure out how to allocate this in dealing with these full models. I appreciate what you did give us, but updating a full model was very hard. To my question, it's just related to ethanol. I wanted to ask how many gallons you sold of ethanol in the quarter. And then really kind of the heart of the question here is, what's the sustainability, in your opinion, of these current spot margins? It's kind of exciting. I mean, we haven't seen margins like this since something like 2006. And I'm not exactly sure what's going to knock us off these pretty good margins. There'll be some volatility, but these dynamics seem strong, but I'd like to hear your opinion on the topic.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","This is Juan. As you said, supply-demand fundamentals drove a reduction in inventory during the quarter. And as such, margins responded to that. A combination of factors. With the drop in corn prices, ethanol is a very competitive fuel. So the export demand has been very strong through traditional places and sometimes not-so-traditional places. Domestic demand was okay during the Q4. We've seen a little bit of a drop in domestic demand as the weather gets nastier in January. Obviously, nobody likes to drive in the dark and with icy roads. But we see export demand continue to be strong. So we enjoyed very good margins in Q4, and we are expecting strong margins going into 2014.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Juan, would you agree that you did not fully capture the spot margins in the fourth quarter? And consequently, could we expect margins for realized results at ADM to actually improve with ethanol going forward?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","So many moving pieces, David, in this sense. I think we saw strong margins at times. As I said, during Q4, we saw inventory being reduced. But then, production came back stronger. And with a little bit of a decline in demand in -- on gasoline, overall demand in January, inventories dropped -- stopped dropping, if you will, so it's kind of flattish. So I think you're going to see volatility. It's high volatility still, but with positive margins, so we're optimistic but remain cautious on the volatility of it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Ann Duignan. Can we step back to Ag Services again just for a moment? I just wanted to clarify something. With the capacity for farmers to store on farm, wouldn't we -- or shouldn't we always anticipate that during the fall as corn price are low, farmers will continue to do this every year, and structurally, through the course of the year, your margins will be lower?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I think what -- I think, Ann, what we have seen this year is that -- traditionally, the farmers get into this with the beans with some material. But with 3 years of very low crops, what's happened is that all in-farm storage was very depleted. And I think what we've seen is a replenishment of the biplane that we haven't seen in quite a while. So this is not the usual occurrence, if you will.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But we've seen a significant increase in the amount of on-farm storage, so wouldn't we anticipate it to be a bigger issue going forward in a normal crop year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","But if you look at the statistics over the last 10 years, production has been growing at 2.2%, while in-farm storage has been growing at 1.1%. So in reality, we're not seeing a significant shift towards in-farm storage versus off-farm storage.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I'll leave it there and maybe come back offline. A separate question, just more of a philosophical question. For the calculation of return on invested capital, are you including impairment charges or not? And if not, why not?","Ray G. Young","For the adjusted ROIC -- I mean, for the reported ROIC, it includes everything. And for the adjusted ROIC, we did back out the impairment charges there. And the purpose there is just we're trying to reflect a run rate. Our adjusted ROIC calc [ph] is supposed to represent the run rate in terms of returns of our operation.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And your adjusted ROIC, that's fourth quarter, was that -- is that -- were you pleased with that? Would you like it to have been higher? How should we think about that going forward?","Ray G. Young","A couple of comments, Ann. This is a 4-quarter trailing average. And so, therefore, while it reflects our fourth quarter, it actually reflects the first 3 quarters of the year as well, which, as you know, was negatively impacted by the residual impacts of the 2012 drought. I think what we're encouraged about is the fact that it's turning. So it's actually -- even the 4-quarter trailing average is now turning in the right direction there. And second, when you look at the static ROIC-over-WACC, we're actually encouraged by just looking purely in the fourth quarter on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, it was actually a very good number.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So all things being equal, we should look forward to a stronger ROIC going into '14?","Ray G. Young","With the 4-quarter trailing average, as we kind of work through the first 3 quarters of 2013, you should start continuing to see improvements in that number.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to touch on Ag Services again because the numbers you gave, I guess, the normalized range being $200 million to $250 million, I thought the previous range was $150 million to $200 million on a normalized basis, but that just included the merchandising and transportation business. So can you bridge the gap? Because now you include milling in there, bridge the gap from the $150 million to $200 million to $200 million to $250 million now?","Ray G. Young","Yes, Ryan, that was simply adjustment for the milling, including the milling division as part of Ag Services. So it's really the same range. So the old $150 million to $200 million equals the $200 million to $250 million, and we haven't really updated that range yet. What we're going to do is we're going to see how the segment performs over the next little while. And then maybe by the end of the year, we could probably have an update in terms of what that range would be.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But is it fair to say that you guys have added some capacity over the last few years and that you've ripped out a decent amount of cost from that business as well, so the range is going to be higher?","Ray G. Young","That's the reason why I say we'll have an update on that range later this year, reflective of the assets that we put into the segment and our improvement in performance in that segment.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","And remember, Ryan, what I mentioned in the last call is that we like to see how the new assets perform under the full crop and that -- before we declare a range. And we haven't seen that as part of the reluctant corn-selling in the U.S. So we haven't seen that yet.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And so -- I mean, given the size of the corn crop, do you think that -- are you starting to see farmer-selling -- do you expect that to come in the next few months before planting season? Or are they waiting to see what happens with the number of acres they get planted in corn?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could it be a lot bigger than that number, given that the previous corn crop was 13 billion bushels versus the record crop we had this year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","We should see a little bit better farmer-selling during -- in 2014. And we expect Ag Services results to improve from what we saw in the Q4 as we go forward and we commercialize the full crop.","Ray G. Young","Yes.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just one more. If you could just give a little bit more detail, I mean, I guess, what happened in the international merchandising operations? Like from the execution issues that you had, could you give a little bit more specific detail?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. They were in different parts of the world. Argentina had some issues with smaller wheat crop and cancellation of exports, so that reduced the volume there. There were some issues in loading in Eastern Europe. There've been some issues with some rejections of boats in China. So I mean, issues here and there. Nothing by itself spectacular or very material, but when you start adding up several issues in a quarter, you get the result. Also, there were not that many merchandising opportunities out there. So when you have a reduced margin per se and then you have execution issues, you end up with the results we ended up with.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","There's been a lot of currency volatility in the last few weeks, especially with Latin American currencies. And I think your stock has been adversely affected by it and maybe wrongly so. And I want to know -- my perception is that the weaker currencies will improve the affordability of your Brazilian and Argentine crop as you merchandise it globally. But I suspect that there's other challenges as well. So can you just talk a little bit about how you are executing differently in an environment where these emerging market currencies are falling?","Ray G. Young","We've seen -- through the history of ADM, we've seen volatility in currencies, whereby the U.S. dollar is stronger and the U.S. dollar is weaker. We adapt to that, and we adjust to that. Frankly, for our fourth quarter results, currency was really not a factor in our results overall, and so we didn't -- that's the reason why we didn't call it out here at all. In looking at the first quarter, clearly, we've seen some weakness in emerging market currencies. Probably, the thing that we're watching more closely is not necessarily the currency moves but, really, what's happening in these specific countries from a political perspective and whether they put restrictions on imports and exports of grains. And so that's probably a bigger factor that we're watching more carefully than simply the volatility on the currency.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I think also, Rob, what -- probably the biggest impact is in the psychology of the farmer and what it does to their intentions of selling, like you can see in Argentina now that they see their crop as a protection of value against the potential devaluation. So we're monitoring much more that impact.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I didn't notice anything with Paraguay's currency situation. Does it affect Paraguay at all or the farmer intentions there?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","No, we have been receiving beans in Paraguay. Plants have been running very, very well. So no, we have seen no issues there at all.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'll reiterate actually what David Driscoll said. It would definitely be helpful for an expanded P&L on the x-o [ph] items for sure. But I have a couple questions. One is, do you expect operating profit in sweeteners to hold steady in 2014 given the fructose pricing?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Ken, this is Juan. I think we -- it's a long road ahead. I mean, obviously, we are very early in the year, and there are many, many variables. We -- as I said before, pricing are weaker going in, than we expected. We have to see how much of that will be offset still by lower corn costs. We have some ability to manage our product mix. There are -- some of our products that are doing very well. There's going to be some opportunities because of our competitiveness in costs to pick up some spot export businesses. So all that goes into the pod. But overall, I will say the first indication is on headwind on price.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. The second question I have is the Argentine devaluation, I guess that it makes your products cheaper. But can you talk about the impact of the Argentine devaluation on the merchandising opportunities if -- maybe I'm going too far, but if there's a devaluation, wouldn't you see a lot of the crop out of Argentina move to the market? Would that create a near-term dislocation or just an overflow of exports that might limit the merchandising opportunities or can you work around that? Can you just talk about how you handle something like this?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes -- no. Certainly, when the opportunities come to the market, I mean, we will benefit from that. At this point in time, the farmers continue not to sell their soybean crops. The expectations are that maybe they're going to sell about 20% of that crop by March, so that may be 10 to 11 million tons of material. And certainly, we can easily handle that.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And my final question is the biodiesel number was extraordinary. Can you talk about the sustainability of this and how we kind of think about the biodiesel number for the going-forward look?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Sure. As you said, it was extraordinary. And as such, it will probably not repeat itself in the further quarters. You know that, certainly, with the elimination of the subsidy, there was some incentive for people to take advantage on that, and that we saw higher volumes in Q4. So I think we are waiting for EPA numbers, and that will determine a little bit the future of that. But certainly, we could see headwinds, and we cannot reproduce this kind of volumes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A question on sweeteners and starches in the quarter. That number, year-over-year growth is very strong, and that's extraordinarily a strong number. Could you just share with us what were the factors that allowed that division to be so strong in this quarter?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Farha, this is Juan. Certainly, volumes were good for us, but the most important factor was the reduction in corn costs.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And so going forward, that reduction in corn costs, they're still going to be there. Clearly, pricing will come down into the next year. Perhaps, just going back to Ken's question a little bit, any additional color in terms of -- for the year-over-year number, how should we think about this division, given that this fourth quarter was so extraordinarily strong for you? Or maybe a longer-term normalized look at what you expect this quarter this sweetener and starches business to deliver.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, the sweeteners and starches business, as I said before, has -- it has more complexity than just the liquid sweeteners. So it's a portfolio of products, and it's very integral to the way we manage our asset flexibility and our product mix. So going into this year versus last year, the industry capacity have not increased. The demand of the volumes is going to be a little bit lower. There is this new soda tax in Mexico that some of the experts are predicting that maybe is going to impact about 5% of volume. There's also -- was a great sugar crop in Mexico that make sugar prices very, very low there. So those are the headwinds that we are seeing. And as I said, that has driven prices in these early negotiations down versus what we expected. Part of that will be offset by lower corn costs. But again, remember, Farha, we make more than 30 products from corn. So our ability to manage that, our ability to procure corn, that gives us an overall sense of profitability at the end of the year, and we've got 11 months ahead of us to turn that around. So again, early indications are some headwinds there, but we still have a lot of levers to pull.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on bioproducts, you've mentioned that you're operating that business better, particularly ethanol, and that you're implementing increased hedging. Historically, ADM used to be much more on the spot market in terms of ethanol. Could you share with us how you plan to manage the hedge program for that bioproducts division? And any color in terms of forward read you could give on that business, that would be really helpful.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, if you recall -- nothing specifically to point my finger on. Last year, in December, we had a very bad year. And we held a call to arms, in which we put everybody to review every step of the operation because last year inventories were very high, margins were very low, so we really needed a big intervention from management on how to turn around that business. So we looked at everything. And it's not that we had a particular weakness. It's just we looked at the risk management, the procurement, the transportation, the manufacturing, the distribution, every step of the chain, and we implemented the battery of actions in all those. And all those with a different intensity in different times of the year had been reflected in the improvements that we've seen in 2013, that plus the industry that obviously improved. So I wouldn't have -- I wouldn't put my finger in any particular thing, other than an overall improvement through the chain in the way we manage the program. And great kudos to the team that has done a fantastic job. And it's the same team that will handle '14, so we're very optimistic.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to talk a little bit more on the ethanol side. You guys talked a little bit about the potential for some growth opportunity for E15 and E85. And I'm just wondering what some of the new capacity or, I guess, previously idled capacity coming back online. How much do you see E15 and E85 maybe growing in '14 and, really, over the next couple years?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Michael, listen, we're very encouraged by the recent improvement in the number of stations that are dispensing E15. It's obviously a slow process. We predicted it was going to be a slow process as maybe was E10, but we've seen the number of stations doubled recently to about 60 or 70 on a national basis that are dispensing E15. We see the number of stations dispensing E85 being in the 3,000. So we've seen some news about some of the gasoline distributors about embracing E15. So we think that gasoline -- ethanol being the lowest cost transportation fuel right now and as people realize that if they price it correctly, they can get market share and they can entice the consumer to use it, we think more and more will continue to happen. And the propagation of that is inevitable as -- because there is economic reason for that. So we're optimistic. It's very difficult to call a rate on something that we don't have control. So we just can only work with our partners to support that introduction. But we are very hopeful about and very optimistic and very confident, given the recent news.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, terrific. And just shifting gears a little bit, I mean, over the last quarter, there was some news about China rejecting some shipments of some U.S. corn. And I guess as you think about your Ag Services business, I mean, how much does that impact that segment of your business? And I mean, I guess now they've sort of specified which variety of the corn that they're not looking to take at the moment. But how does -- did that have any impact on your 4Q results? And is that something you can manage through or how do you handle that?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Michael, the impact was rather small in Q4, but we had an impact. Certainly, it's not business as usual anymore. Our team has worked very diligently in this. We are working very close with the farmers to encourage them to understand exactly what they are planting, working closely with them on understanding whether they're going to be delivering in every location, having all the stewardship programs in place, reviewing also some of the contracts to make sure that we have the proper tolerances to what we can deliver. So we'll probably increase the intensity in which we are looking at the whole process and how vigilant we are. But I will say we didn't have a significant impact in Q4.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, great. And then my last question is just with respect to Argentina, with a lot of the farmers sort of holding back the sales of soybeans over the last 3 months, how do you think about how that will impact your North American crushing margins once some of those soybeans start heading to market? And I guess, taking a broader look, I mean, do you think that could create some headwinds in '14 or do you think that the U.S. demand is strong enough for your products that, even if there is more competition from Argentina later in the year, that your margins can hold?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes to both. Yes, when Argentina brings all that capacity to market and produce the meal, certainly, they will try to export it. So that will put some pressure on either Europe or even the export demand that we're seeing from the U.S. But we continue to see very strong demand continue to grow then, and we need every bean out there to try to satisfy that demand. So it's a little bit of both, to be honest though.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with CL King.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The first question, I don't know if Pat is still in the room, but probably the combination of Pat and Juan, but, Pat, you've done a really good job in getting those returns up in the company and a focus on returns. And you've indicated and shown and displayed that you are willing to divest low-return, either strategic or even non-strategic, assets in your process going forward. Can you just talk a little bit about where you are with that, what you see as more opportunity for ADM to improve their returns via maybe the divestiture thereof of some low-return assets?","Patricia A. Woertz","Yes, Eric, the -- I think you're right that we think what drives shareholder value is a combination of earnings growth, strong capital returns and a compelling strategy for growth going forward that is a value-creating growth. So I think the changes that we've implemented, that Juan and the team have implemented, that Ray and the team have implemented, related to focusing on returns and looking at an economic value creation, is really both -- on both sides of sort of a portfolio look. Those areas with strong returns, what does the future of those areas look like? Is there ways to expand? As well as those on the lower end, is this just a secular issue? Is this something that, forward look, can't be changed? And everything is under review. So I think it's a more detailed granular global look at individual businesses that everything is on the table for the opportunities ahead, and that can include some portfolio changes. Maybe I'll ask Juan to comment on how that gets implemented with each business as they're looking at this going forward, but I think there's a very strong emphasis on overall portfolio management for the ability to get returns that are -- our objective is 200 basis points above WACC, to do that over this cycle and to be able to create that value with the larger portion being in higher-returned areas.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","So, Eric, Pat just spoke about the granularity of our approach. And I think very simplistically, I think, if you think about the strategic characterization of our portfolio, making sure each individual business understands what is the most value-creating strategy for them going forward. For some of them, it's improved profitability with a sense of urgency. For some of them, it's to grow. It depends on how are they in -- respective to their delivering against WACC. So I think it's very important to have that. So you don't have everybody trying to chase growth or everybody curtailing growth because it's looking at profitability. We are a large company, we are a complex company, and we need to manage the portfolio with that level of granularity to be maximizing value creation.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. A more specific question. The futures curve, you talked about historic basis in corn, particularly corn in the fourth quarter. Now that curve has flattened out quite a bit in January. And we're starting to see estimates of 93-plus million acres to be planted this year. And obviously, the incentive is coming down pretty quickly for farmers to hold on to their corn. And they're going to need to get some cash in their pocket to pay for some input costs here pretty quick because planting is 60 to 90 days around the corner here. It doesn't -- it seems to me that you really can't go much beyond toward the end of the first quarter or maybe the start of the second quarter before you start seeing this corn free up, unless there aren't the merchandising opportunities on the export side, et cetera, that create the impetus for them to release those crops. So I guess, the question is, timing seems like it should be more in favor given the futures curve to release some of those. And what is the outlook for corn exports given the Ukraine and Argentina and Brazil and the competition for that and then, obviously, the disruption in the Ukraine? It's a big question.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, no, that's all right.","Patricia A. Woertz","It's all over the world there.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Eric, as I look at corn, certainly, at the moment, good export demand, we continue to see good export demand from the U.S. So that's offering support to corn. Certainly, you see the resistance on -- coming from the side of the farmer selling. And as you said, at one point in time, they need to sell to get some cash. I think that there is some expectations, as you mentioned, on the acreage that maybe the farmers think that for corn to buy some of those acreage out of soybeans, it needs to rally a little bit, and maybe that's the last hope that they are trying to hold to their grains to. A farmer is very well capitalized. They don't need to borrow. So at this point, they've seen higher prices. Obviously, corn dropped much more than soybean recently. So they just -- they don't like the current prices, and they are waiting.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes. Well, I mean, there's obviously no incentive to hold beans. And again, you do have a positive basis yet. There is a basis in corn, but it's -- obviously, it's come down a bit in recent weeks. So it just seems, at some point here, that, that's going to open up for them.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But the other -- just kind of the final question that I have -- I could ask a lot of questions. But when you look out for the kind of the domestic soy crush, given the disparity in the protein markets today, very high beef pricing, relatively high pork pricing and chicken being a very favorably priced meat protein, is that really an overriding key factor that should keep your domestic meal demand pretty strong?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, we're seeing it the same way, Eric. To be honest, I mean, it's been strong, and it continues to be strong. So we're very optimistic about our crushing going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just have a couple of questions left. Could you just tell me what -- in your $0.95 calculation, what was the tax rate you had in the quarter?","Ray G. Young","Well, for the -- as you know, on a reported basis, it was a higher tax rate because of all the valuation allowances, et cetera, et cetera. When you actually back out all the special items and the valuation allowances, we were actually running around a 30% rate for the quarter.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I'll follow up offline because I was getting closer to 25%. And then maybe, Pat, on this EPA issue with ethanol, I know the common period has just ended or it's about to end. And from what I'm reading, it sounds like there's likely to be some litigation and so forth. But you guys are -- make a lot of money in a quarter. I think the fiscal [ph] sets the most since '06. Export market is good. Corn is cheap. You have incentive there to use E15. I mean, if this EPA ruling, in the end, doesn't go your way, how upset are you?","Patricia A. Woertz","Any time the government makes a plan and you make investments related to that plan, you're disappointed if they change the rules in the game. But I think, to your point, economics are kind of the rule of the day, and economics generally override what is even -- or some of the demand assumptions. I think with E10, and at least you figure -- that's going to grow to the 13 billion, 13.4 billion gallons. Juan mentioned E85 had some growth, so does E15. Exports could be 500 million to maybe 1 billion gallons we've seen in some given years. So I think you see a market that, potentially, economics could just use up all the production, which is what you'd like to think would be the case that we saw marching toward 2015. So maybe you even get a little bit of that movement occurring here in 2014. So no, you don't like to see the rules of the game change, but again, economics, at the end of the day, are kind of what seems to be the ruling factor.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And do you have a sense in what the -- sort of what -- let's assume EPA makes the ruling final. What are the stages of litigation? How long do you think it would take to sort of move that issue through the courts? I mean, what court would it go to?","Patricia A. Woertz","I probably am not an expert to comment on that at all. I think the EPA has indicated something about the summer now being their -- the timing of this. So maybe you'll find that life just goes on without any comments from them. And where litigation goes from that, I wouldn't comment.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Russell with Macquarie.","Andrew Russell - Macquarie Research","Yes, just continuing on oilseeds prices and wheat on demand a bit earlier. But there are reports of competitors closing soybean crushing plants in North America, based on weak U.S. soy meal demand and, obviously, a big soybean crop in South America. Could you maybe just hit a bit further on sort of how demand is playing out locally, maybe specifically in the [indiscernible] sector?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think that -- Andrew, this is Juan. We -- I remember, a couple of years ago, we suffered really with low capacity utilization in North America as South America had a very big growth. And we went through a sort of review of our facilities, and we actually shut down some of our facilities. So we are very happy and content with where our facilities are placed and the integration that our facilities has in terms of having crushing and refineries and all that. So at this point in time, from a demand perspective and also from an availability of beans perspective, we are very happy with our footprint, and that's reflected on the results. We see demand, going forward, continues strong. We are working very close with our customers not only in standard products but also in more specialty products, as I mentioned before. So I think the team is in a very good place in North America.","Andrew Russell - Macquarie Research","Got it. And maybe just secondly, following up, you pointed to strategic M&A opportunities, you're able to increase your holding in GrainCorp. Could a tie-up perhaps with a local operator bring that deal back to the table?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, I'd be disappointed, Andrew, if I didn't get a question on GrainCorp, particularly with your accent. I think the strategic rationale for ownership in GrainCorp remains the same today as it did before with -- it's a good business location, strategic region, proximity to Asia. We're pleased with our current ownership stake and have no plans to sell it at this time. As you may know, though, GrainCorp is going through -- and we're very respectful of our process as they identify a new CEO. They have an interim CEO. So we'd like to work with them and create value for both companies. But I won't comment on any increase in stake at this time. We're evaluating that option, and they're in the process of making a change at the top, so I'll leave it at that.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A quick question. In the slides, I think you said that warm weather in Europe was a positive for your biodiesel demand, and I wasn't quite sure why that would be the case.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Well, normally, it's just the driving season and also the difficulties of dealing with biodiesel in very cold weather. Early in the quarter, the weather was seasonally a little bit warmer than expected in Germany at that point in time.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So it's just ease of use and also driving? Okay.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Exactly, yes.","Operator","And we have another follow-up question from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ray and Juan and Pat, but starting with Ray, when I look at the cash balance and the total debt and RMIs, effectively, it's a net cash balance sheet, an extremely clean balance sheet. I think the -- I forget exactly what the share repurchase, the 18 million shares, is like $700-and-some-odd million in 2014, a $1.4 billion CapEx expenditure is very trivial in respect to the cash that was generated by the firm and the size and the quality of the balance sheet right now. Bottom line here, it just feels like you have the capacity to do a lot of things that, perhaps, you haven't really talked about. Maybe you can't because it's M&A focused. But I'd just like you guys to spend just a couple of minutes here. It's been a long time since I've seen a balance sheet this strong for ADM. You look like you have the potential for something big. Following GrainCorp, what's the amount of assets that you see out there that are potentially available for sale?","Ray G. Young","Well, let me start. First of all, we acknowledge the balance sheet is pretty strong as of the end of 2013, when we developed a capital plan for 2014, we reflected upon the cash that we're going to generate in '14. And we want to make sure that we -- with the cash generated in '14, that we provide a balanced approach in terms of returning some of it to our shareholders, and some of it we're going to reinvest in the business. But effectively, we're preserving -- through the 2014 capital plan, we're still preserving effectively the year-end balance sheet of 2013 for us to undertake strategic initiatives. And it's important for us to do that. I think, as you know, we still want to grow the business. There are opportunities geographically that we want to look at. But we're going to be very prudent about that. We're going to be very careful and make sure that these are investments which continue to generate good long-term returns for our company. Let me turn it over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","David, as we look at opportunities, certainly, this is an industry, from a grain perspective, of relatively high capital intensity and low margins. So you need to make sure you are very prudent in how you invest this to make sure you return the cost of capital. So in that area, we're looking at mostly consolidation plays. So -- and so we don't want to add that much capacity, but consolidation plays, we think, is something that we can take advantage of. Plugging those assets into our system, they benefit, we benefit, I think the shareholder benefits. In terms of other M&As, we have many growth projects, internal growth projects, but we are looking also to -- for some specialty products that are very synergistic with our product lines, as we go around the world and work with our customers and see whether they are getting new regulations and new trends that they need to fulfill and whether we can fulfill them with our products, we develop those products. But when we can, we are looking to add that to continue to keep those customers satisfied and buying from ADM most of their purchases.","Patricia A. Woertz","Maybe I'll add then, David, to your point, I would agree that it's been -- it's a very strong balance sheet. And to build on Ray and Juan, both, what we've talked about in terms of a balanced capital plan for next year, it's really the $1.4 billion includes sort of smaller M&A and as well as the growth projects we've talked about in maintenance and our new ERP project that we call One ADM [ph]. But we can also be able to look at strategic M&A, and that doesn't mean one that has -- doesn't have good returns. I think we've shown discipline. We've looked at assets that need to meet our return hurdles and maybe expanding beyond just consolidation, but some of these specialty products, et cetera, we have the capability to do that and do it smartly if the opportunity is there.","Operator","And at this time, we have reached our allotted time for questions. And I would like to turn the call back over to Patricia.","Patricia A. Woertz","Very good. Well, thank you, everyone, for your attention today. If you turn back to Slide 15, it does show our upcoming investor events. Please follow up with Case if you have any further questions or details today, and thanks again for your time and interest.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Ruth Ann Wisener, Vice President, Investor Relations for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Ms. Wisener, you may begin.","Ruth Ann Wisener","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we are webcasting this presentation on our website, adm.com. The replay will also be available at that address.","For those following the presentation, please turn to Slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of the comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. Statements are based on many assumptions and factors, including availability and prices of raw materials, market conditions, operating efficiencies, access to capital and actions of governments. Any changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results.","To the extent permitted under applicable law, the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.","Please turn to Slide 3. On today's call, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Woertz, will provide an overview of the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results. Our Chief Operating Officer, Juan Luciano, will review our operations. And then, Craig Huss, our Chief Risk Officer, will join Pat, Ray and Juan during the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Please turn to Slide 4. I will now turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Ruth Ann, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. This morning, we reported second quarter net earnings of $223 million or $0.34 per share on a diluted basis. Our adjusted EPS was $0.46 per share. Segment operating profit was $647 million.","The team managed well through this period as tight U.S. crop supplies reduced overall volumes. Also, our corn results improved significantly amid a volatile ethanol industry conditions.","During the quarter, we continue to work to improve the company's future returns and earnings power over the cycle. Our effort to unlock cash reached $2 billion, with the team reaching this milestone a half year ahead of schedule. And in costs, we made solid progress toward our goal of $200 million in additional cost reductions by the end of 2014. Our cash flow in the second quarter was strong, and we reduced our debt significantly.","We've received 6 regulatory approvals for our acquisition of GrainCorp in Australia, and we await the final 3.","Looking ahead, we will be managing through tight crop supplies until the forecast large, but delayed U.S. harvest.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Pat. Slide 5 provides some financial highlights for the quarter, which I'll run through quickly.","Quarterly segment operating profit was $647 million, up 19% from last year's $544 million.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29%, down slightly from the 30% rate in the same quarter last year.","On a fully diluted basis, our earnings per share were $0.34 compared to last year's $0.43.","Our adjusted earnings were $0.46 per share compared to last year's $0.38 per share.","On Chart 17 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted earnings for the periods ending June 30.","For this quarter, we had a LIFO charge of $39 million or $0.04 per share.","In addition, we had mark-to-market valuation losses on foreign currency hedges of $51 million or $0.05 per share related to our planned purchase of GrainCorp. During the quarter, we established some currency hedges for the purchase and the Australian dollar subsequently depreciated, resulting in these valuation losses.","In addition, we updated our provision related to the previously disclosed FCPA matter. We increased this provision by $29 million to a total of $54 million, based upon recent progress in discussions with the U.S. regulators examining the case.","Our trailing LIFO adjusted 4 quarter average ROIC of 5.2% was 50 basis points below our WACC of 5.7%. Excluding specified items, our trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC was also 5.7%.","Slide 6 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Juan will talk about the segment results in his update.","Let me touch on a few items of significance in the corporate sector. I mentioned LIFO earlier, a charge of $39 million for the quarter as rising commodity prices during the quarter impacted our inventory valuations. That's compared to a gain of $50 million 1 year ago.","Interest expense of $104 million for the quarter, lower than prior year, due to lower net debt levels.","Corporate expenses of $71 million were up from the $67 million level 1 year ago as we incurred some additional projects-related costs.","I mentioned the mark-to-market valuation loss of $51 million related to our Australian dollar hedging, and I also mentioned the increased provision related to the FCPA matter.","And finally, on the other of $65 million, this includes a mark-to-market valuation losses related to our investment in CIP.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 7. We present here the cash flow statement for the 6 months ending June 30, 2013, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $700 million from operations before working capital changes in the first half of 2013, compared to $1.1 billion last year. Working capital changes were source of $1.6 billion of cash in the period, compared to last year when there were significant use of cash. The company's efforts to focus on working capital efficiency were evident in our first half cash flow results.","Total capital spending for the 6 months was $442 million, and acquisitions amounted to $16 million.","After changes in working capital and investments, our free cash flow for the first half of 2013 was almost $1.9 billion compared to a large use of cash of $800 million last year. With the strong cash flows, we were able to reduce drawings on our working capital lines such as commercial paper borrowings.","We did restart repurchasing shares in the quarter in a modest amount. We finished out the quarter with an average outstanding of 663 million shares on a fully diluted basis.","Slide 6 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of June 30 for both 2013 and 2012. Cash on hand was approximately $2 billion, up from the $500 million from the prior year. Our operating working capital was about $12 billion, down from the $14.6 billion level last year or a reduction of $2.6 billion. Of this reduction, about $1.6 billion was related to lower quantities of inventory.","Total debt was about $7.5 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash of $5.5 billion, down significantly from the 2012 level of $8.9 billion. The $5.5 billion net debt balance represents the lowest level at mid-year since 2007.","Our shareholders' equity of $19 billion is about $1 billion higher than the level last year. Our ratio of net debt to total capital, excluding cash from gross debt, is 22%, much improved from the June 30, 2012, level of 33%. So we are reducing leverage and maintaining a very strong balance sheet.","We have $8 billion in available global credit capacity at end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to about $10 billion of liquidity.","Clearly, we have a balance sheet strong enough that could easily finance the GrainCorp acquisition and handle the seasonal increase in working capital needs as we enter the North American harvest later this year.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Thanks, Ray. Good morning to everyone on the call. Beginning on Slide 9, I will take you through the highlights of each of our business segments.","Oilseeds operating profit in the second quarter was $321 million, down $10 million from the same period one year earlier.","Crushing and origination operating profit was $185 million, up $35 million from the year ago quarter. European crushing results improved significantly year-over-year as delays in the arrival of South American meal contributed to stronger margins. In North America, tighter crop supplies resulted in weaker soy and softseed crush margins. South American operations recovered from the first quarter and generated strong overall results equivalent to the year ago quarter. The team in South America continued to manage through logistical challenges and we saw improved export volumes and margins.","In Paraguay, our new soybean processing plant ran at full capacity for the quarter.","Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $93 million for the quarter, up $9 million on the stronger European results.","Cocoa and other results decreased $58 million due to lower margins on businesses contracted in earlier quarters.","Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were up $4 million from the same period last year, principally reflecting our share of the improved results from Wilmar International Ltd.","Please turn to Slide 10. Corn processing operating profit of $223 million represented an increase of $149 million from the same period 1 year earlier.","Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $9 million to $126 million. Excluding the impact of corn hedge ineffectiveness, sweeteners and starches results improved by $25 million on steady North American sales.","Bioproducts results increased $158 million to $97 million as ethanol results improved significantly amid volatile industry conditions.","Turning to Slide 11. You will see a review of our Agricultural Services segment. Operating profit was $81 million, down $33 million when excluding Gruma from the year ago result.","Merchandising and handling earnings declined $16 million to $14 million. The impact of last year's drought continued to limit U.S. origination and export volumes. And international merchandising results declined on lower margins. Results this quarter were also reduced by some non-recordable expenses.","Transportation results decreased $14 million to $3 million as lower U.S. export volumes reduced barge freight utilization.","Milling and other results remained steady, excluding last year's Gruma earnings, as the milling business continued to perform well. We sold our stake in Gruma last December.","Looking ahead, the impact of last summer's U.S. drought continues as U.S. crop supplies remain tight. At the same time, the crops in the field seems to be developing well with 64% of the corn crop rated good to excellent compared to 23% the year ago. With high prices for last year's crop and lower prices for the crops coming this fall, the market is inverted. We have to manage this inverse carefully so we don't carry on -- carry high-cost inventory into a low-cost environment.","In terms of timing, this spring rain delayed plantings and the recent cold weather will lead to late harvest this fall.","Slide 12 is a progress update on our efforts around what we call the 3 Cs: capital, cost and cash. Through the first half of 2013 our CapEx is in line with our production of $1 billion. We continue to focus our growth investments outside the U S.","In the area of costs, we have already implemented steps that will deliver about a 1\/3 of our target of an additional $200 million in cost reductions by the end of 2014. These savings will come from improvements in energy and working efficiency, repairs and maintenance, process technology and procurement.","And we have continued to strengthen our cash position. After our team achieved our $1 billion challenge several months ahead of schedule last year, we determined to find the second billion dollars. And as Pat mentioned, we now achieved that goal, once again, ahead of schedule. I'm proud of the team's effort in capital, costs and cash that are enhancing ADM's future returns and earnings power.","Pat?","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Juan. So let me summarize. Segment operating profit up 19%. Ag Services down on tight U.S. supplies. Oilseeds had strong crush and origination, but weak cocoa results. Corn was up with volatile ethanol conditions. And we have to carefully manage the inverse as we look toward a later harvest. And very good ahead of schedule progress on the 3 Cs.","Now before Craig Huss joins Juan, Ray and me for the Q&A, I wanted to let you know that this will be Craig's last quarterly call. After 37 years with ADM, he is retiring later this year. Craig has been a huge presence at ADM: his size and voice, and certainly, his contributions. So thank you very much, Craig, for all of your efforts.","And with that, operator, if you'll please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","A very quick question. Looking forward as the cost basis in both beans and corn have collapsed over the last few weeks, I suggest that it's going to be a challenging environment managing this inversion between build and a new corn crop. But I guess on the margin, are you feeling a little bit better about supply since the last quarterly call as maybe farmers are more willing to sell, or either around the margin are you becoming a little bit more cautious?","Craig E. Huss","Tim, this is Craig. I would say that you've heard a couple of times that the crop is going to be a little delayed. And I think that the main reason for that is this crop is so healthy and it's 64% good to excellent. I think we'll have bigger crops. They may be a couple of weeks later, but we are recharging the process where our storage should be full and it should help us going forward. As far as the farmer selling, he probably will be a reluctant seller at some point, but -- for example, the $14 billion ballpark corn crop, there's going to be -- there will be plenty to move.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just moving on to the cocoa business. Any updates as far as your strategy there? And then I guess, if there is not the potential to divest this in the near term, based on your comments on the prior call, do you expect that you'll be able to get some pricing increases or at least margin improvement compared to the first half and the second half?","Patricia A. Woertz","Tim, certainly conditions that have negatively impacted our cocoa business have subsided or moderated a bit. And this isn't the business we have to sell. We've been doing a very careful portfolio review. And as I know you'll understand, if the discussions are ongoing or if there's a process underway, it's premature to comment on that process. I will tell you that we're very disciplined and we look at portfolio importantly. It needs -- we need to take into account the both financial objectives and how it fits into our strategy. So in terms of confirming that we have -- we're taking a look at this, I can say that, but I can't say any more than that.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, as far as the improvement in cash flow, should we expect any updates on your new initiatives forecast in the coming quarters, or are you still waiting for the GrainCorp transaction and the harvest to come in before making any final decisions on that?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, you can imagine if we have about $10 billion in cash that we have lots of opportunity and options. And of course, you -- as we've talked about the GrainCorp acquisition, we still believe it's on track to close by the end of the year. We hope for that. And we can take the uses of cash, including -- we started back our share buyback program. We are going into a harvest, as you know. So it's just a normal cycle. We'll have a need for cash. But we have lots of flexibility and extremely strong balance sheet.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Dave Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Craig, I want to wish you the best. I've always appreciated your insights and you really will be missed. Thanks for all the years' great stuff, and good luck in retirement. Certainly well earned.","Craig E. Huss","Thanks very much.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Pat, want to ask you a few questions related to ethanol and the Renewable Fuel Standard, the RFS. The first one is just related to -- do you believe that the independent refiners have a legitimate complaint on the RIN costs? And I would just observe that, frankly, on their conference calls in this recent quarterly report, I mean, they seem to be going crazy on this issue. But I'd really like to hear your version of this RIN issue and whether or not they have a legitimate complaint. And then I have a follow-up related to ethanol, if I may.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, this is Juan, David. Listen, the market today provides an incentive for people to blend ethanol. And I would argue that E85, for those people that are pricing it correctly, it has -- we have seen some of the volumes for these distributors, if you would, tripled. So there is an opportunity there. There is elasticity and good demand will come if this ethanol is properly priced and that passed to the consumer. There is also, if you've seen the very level in several countries -- in several states and we have counted already 10 states in which all the regulations have been -- are in place for this to be implemented. So we believe that people have options to blend more. And so we believe that the RIN price is a reaction to their behavior and they could price ethanol more effectively. That will increase demand and they don't need to resort to RINs. So that's my position.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you believe that there's any movement in Congress that is sufficient enough to alter the RFS?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I think to the extent that the RFS impact us, we feel very confident that, that regulation will be maintained.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. Last question on this. It's just E15, in particular. I think by my work, there is about 20 stations in the country that sell E15 and I believe that's about 6 states. So kind of -- what do you assess here on E15 at the moment? And maybe more importantly, do you think that this is really going to catch fire and that we're going to see a heck of a lot more E15 stations throughout the United States in 2014?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, David. I think that we said it before that it was going to be slow and we didn't expect a material volume in 2013. We think that as people get more comfortable and more states have the regulations in place, this will start to proliferate. Also as people tried this effectively, I think that the incentives, especially on a larger corn crop, the incentive to blend ethanol will be there.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Would you then characterize the outlook related to this much better corn crop, much cheaper corn crop? Would you characterize the ethanol outlook as very good for 2014?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I think we said it before, David, that we are very optimistic about the ethanol future for '14 and '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As we look to this large crop, there are a lot of comparisons with 2009 in terms of crop year. I'm wondering if you could comment by segment, if that is the case and we get a very large crop, large volumes, is there any reason why ADM will impose the kind of operating performance in '14 that it did back in 2010? Are there any structural differences such as ethanol margins that would cause you not to deliver very strong margins next year?","Patricia A. Woertz","Ann, let me start and then maybe Juan wants to go through by business a little more. Given that the U.S. is likely to produce a record crop, as your statement indicated, we think conditions are definitely unfolding in a way that would produce some very good conditions for us. But I would add, even more importantly, it's the work that we've undertaken as well with the progress on cash and costs and capital, as well as acquisitions and our investments in a higher return area that position us. We're thinking very well about the opportunities in 2014, a potentially very, very good environment and very good work that when that environment hits can position us for higher returns. Maybe by division, Juan can comment.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Sure. Ann, the way I look at the conditions in the future and maybe you can take Q4 since it's going to be a quarter that we're going to see -- start to see the impact of the new crop, we will see in that environment certainly North American crush utilizations coming up in oilseeds. We will have seen an improved softseed margin environment with a big canola growth in Canada. I think we will see, with lower corn prices, that will favor the relationship between corn products and some of the substitutes, so product inclusion should increase. I think you're going to see better blend in economics. They will entice more blending in terms of ethanol, maybe even improved sweeteners exports as you see a better relationship may be potentially between corn and substitutes like sugar. I think, fundamentally, what we see is that a larger crop will allow us for a better utilization of some of the investments that we've done in the past. So you take that is a source of improved earnings. As I said before, I think that we are optimistic about ethanol margins for '14 and '15. And certainly, a larger corn crop will -- or crops in general will provide ag services and opportunity to utilize all the asset footprint that we have in North America more fully. So I think the opportunity is there for potentially big results.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That was good color. I appreciate it. And just as a follow-up, is there any permanent negative margin impact on the fact that U.S. farmers have now expanded their on-farm storage capabilities?","Craig E. Huss","No, I don't think it is at all. I think the on-farm storage, it just increases total storage and it may delay at times, the point at which they sell the crop. But they have the same pressures and incentives today they've always had is to forward thinking what they think it will do. But I -- it may take a little pressure off selling at harvest. But overall, I don't think it makes a major change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Obviously, I guess an intricate part of the transition over the last couple of years and obviously even further back, can you talk about how, either you, Craig, how are you going to do a succession plan? Who's going to take over your spot and how that's going to work over the next couple of years?","Patricia A. Woertz","I'm going to ask Juan to comment on that. Thanks.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, Ken. I think we have explained it before. We have a risk committee that Craig currently chairs, and we have the business president there and Ray and myself and other people. In this role, Craig works very closely with our business unit heads as they manage their commodity risks within their segments. So Craig's responsibilities will be transitioned to ensure our ongoing oversight on commodity risk management. But this is a smooth transition. This is an area in which, although we're certainly going to miss Craig tremendously as being a great coworker and team member, we have huge expertise and bench strength in these areas. So I think that with the other participants in the chair -- in the committee, I think we're going to be fine.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. My other question I have is -- obviously, with the big crop, your Ag Services is going to have a lot of volume. Can you talk about the margin side of it because there seems to be a lot of crop out there that's not the same sort of dislocation? Can you talk about how you can maximize profit to be maybe like the 2010 and 2011 environment or does it change where you got a lot of volume at a much lower margin structure? Can you just give us a little bit of a balancing act here because I think that kind of helps us all kind of think about the future for ADM?","Craig E. Huss","Sure, this is Craig. I think, first, a large crop doesn't necessarily squeeze margins anymore than a small crop does as people are pushing to whatever capacity they can through their assets. So I don't like to tie those 2 together. We will meet some demand. But we have all these assets that we've talked about for the year that are not being utilized. And we, as the largest storer of grain in the United States, we will be filling those assets. And we'll manage those depending on the cost of carry, et cetera. But I think we've had 2 substandard crops and this is a recharge that is just essential for ADM and we plan on taking advantage of it.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Do you think -- as there's plentiful crops outside the U.S., is there the opportunity to, again, maximize the whole chain of crops or does that change the direction of how much profitability you could actually make in the Ag Services business?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","We look at this, Ken. We think that potentially the U.S. could go a little bit lower in terms of exports in the future because there are other people that are growing their corn acreage. But we look at this in the sense of -- through the value chain. There are so many ways in which we can make money. And we'll look at this from Ag Services perspective, providing different services through the chain and we feel very comfortable about that. Demand continues to be very strong around the world. If you look at, for example, the imports of China, how they're rising to the different commodities. So we do believe that our rolling moving crops and handling crops around the world will benefit significantly with the largest crop around the world. Even our international merchandisers will profit from that as we have invested, as you know, in many, many units and the world. So we feel very good about the potential impact of large crops everywhere in our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Two questions, the first is on GrainCorp. Recently.","we've seen press articles and increasingly you're seeing a lot of talk related to the election, regarding GrainCorp. Do you have any concerns about the timing and whether the transaction will be approved?","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, our timing is still within the process of our expectations. You never know when a new election could have been called when we look back earlier in the year. But we believe that we are -- we've worked with both the Australian regulatory agencies, as well as outside and we're pleased that we have the 6 approvals that I mentioned. And the 3 that remain include FIRB in Australia, South Korea and MOFCOM in China. And I think we're on track for what we thought would be a good taste. We're very respectful of processes and each one have their own regulatory processes to go through and answer questions and so forth. And I feel like we're on track.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then the second thing is regarding South America. How did you think your team did in terms of opportunities versus challenges? And going forward, into next year, where can you look at that business growing because that is an investment area for you?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think the team did a tremendous job in the second quarter. Remember, I mentioned in the first quarter we had 2 impacts, the impact of higher trucking costs that we couldn't hedge; and then the impact of less origination as the farmer was not selling. The team came back strongly in the second quarter, and I think execution was beautiful. In terms of our investments there, the Paraguay crop -- the Paraguay oilseeds plants continues to perform very, very well, running at 100% capacity. And we continue to evaluate other investments, both in the area of logistics in the area of processing. As you described, that's an area of investment for us or growth for us, and we have a very, very good team running it.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And just one comment. Could you just comment on crush margins in South America and perhaps the soy crush margins around the world, kind of what you're seeing over the near term and then how do you express -- expect that to progress going into next year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, crush margins in South America were good in Paraguay and Bolivia. There was a little bit less in Brazil as part of the issue is trying to export mill and you get to queue in the ports. So -- then everybody turns into the domestic market and there is some pressure there. Europe margins were very good when compared to last year. Obviously, some of the delays in South American export, they have provided some opportunity for better margins and soybean in Europe. And biodiesel with less imports and tighter oil inventories was also provided some good margin environment for rapeseed in Europe. South America -- North America, obviously some pressure and you will pressure in the next quarter as we're dealing with the tight crop situation and the inverse that we mentioned before.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then the ability of managing soy crush into next year because we will have a more ample harvest, and do you think capacity in terms of supply demand going into next year, could you just kind of share with us about profit outlook for that business?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","We continue to see demand growing, and our customers have been reporting very healthy earnings and demand, so we feel very good about it.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So question is just you noted that ethanol was volatile in the quarter. So could you just give us some insight into what was driving that volatility and also what the team did well as opposed to results that you posted?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think you pointed correctly, the team did a very good job. What happened there probably during the quarter is we saw some reductions in inventory early in the quarter. And obviously, that bodes well for margins. Then when margin increased -- this is an industry that still has overcapacity. It's a little bit immature industry. Some of these players are undercapitalized, if you will, so a lot of people tend to run for cash. So we saw basically capacity coming back and we saw at the end of the quarter a little bit of a stabilization of that reduction in inventory. And maybe even, to be honest, in July, we saw a little bit of a creep in inventory or a creep in -- yes, in inventory for a few days. So they continue to be volatile. I think that the industry is more disciplined. I think this is a time of the year in which most of us, before the big harvest and before the winter, people tend to do some maintenance to their plants. So we see that may be playing out, those dynamics playing out over the next couple of months. But that's kind of what's happened during the quarter, better margins at the beginning of inventory decline then some people came back into production and that puts some pressure to margins that moved from late June into July.","Patricia A. Woertz","Vincent, maybe adding to Juan's point a little bit. I think we always have thought that there'd be continued volatility even through 2013, until you get the additional bump of the RFS. But import volumes should also decline as we kind of go into the fall. And the integrated network we have, I think, it's a core competency to be able to serve the business and move those volumes around as needed.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then if we think about '14 and you just referenced the further step-up into the RFS, which theoretically at some point will either forces the RIN issue or forces E15 or forces some type of legislative response. Your optimism -- or maybe, Juan, give us an update on your optimism and just clarify whether -- how reliant it is on the RFS for 2014 staying where it is?","Patricia A. Woertz","Maybe I'll start with Washington, and Juan can comment on the economics, which I think economics drive is more so almost than anything else. We did have hearings take place this summer and we heard that the RFS is an important issue. It is important for assuring market access to ethanol. The producers don't control the infrastructure. So consumer's ability to buy E15, E85, et cetera, continues to be important. We heard the White House reiterated support. I think it called it the backbone of the climate policy, included RFS. So you have to remember, for Congress to try to pass anything, there needs to be agreement in -- agreement by both houses and both parties, et cetera. So I think that's the less likely pressure. I think you'll see more the pressure of economics associated with additional blending and RIN sanity somewhat happening.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","That's all right. I just want to emphasize what Pat just said in the sense that I think that the size of the corn crop will bring a very strong economic incentive to blend. I think we all want lower gasoline prices. I think that E15 is there and E85 is there. Listen, I lived in Brazil 20 years ago and we were using higher blend rates than 15% and this was -- these were cars produced by the same manufacturers of cars here. So I think that economic incentive on passing that to the consumer will prevail.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, just looking at your ROIC calculation, the one line in there, the interest-bearing liabilities, obviously that's been coming down as crop prices have gone down, your working capital has gone down. How low do you think that line can go as we move into next year's crop?","Ray G. Young","Well, Vincent, this is Ray here. I think in my comments, part of the reason why we're building up the balance sheet flexibility is that if there's an opportunity for us to accumulate some inventory and benefit from the carry, we will. And so therefore, from a capital perspective, clearly we're managing this thing very, very carefully and managing both the capital investments and also inventory and working capital. But we want -- but we're preparing our balance sheet in order to take advantage of carry opportunities as well. So as we enter the fourth quarter, if there are carry opportunities, we will invest. And we will benefit from that in terms of our financial results, including our returns.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine McCracken with Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just wanted to talk on a -- or had a couple of questions, first on -- relative to the last question on ethanol. You mentioned the issue of overcapacity. We've seen several smaller plants here over the last couple of months being acquired. The expectation is that they'll reopen and add back to some of the production given the margins that we've seen. Is there any risk that we add to the overcapacity situation? Is this something that ADM is looking at as some of these plants now are changing hands?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Christine, we said before this is part of the volatility we keep on referring to. This is, as I said, a relatively new market. It is a very fragmented market. It needs to go through consolidation and there is going to be a period of pain until we gain into that full capacity. As I explained based on the dynamics that I've seen before, we are optimistic for '14 and 15, but '13 is going to still have periods of great margins and periods of some margin pressure as we've seen recently.","Patricia A. Woertz","Christine, we remember that, that 15 billion gallons is really how the industry has been built out to meet that requirement in 2015. And some of that is not running. Some of it maybe is a bit more -- or permanently might fold and maybe others will change hands, but we don't see it being built in a greater capacity than that 15 billion gallons.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","I'm just curious on your sweeteners and starches because you did say, I think, in your comments that things were a little stronger there. And that's a little different, I think, than some of the CSD volume data that we've seen and the comments by some of your competitors. So I'm curious if you think you're gaining share or is there some other strength in that business that we haven't seen.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","We've seen liquid sweeteners volumes that were in line with our expectations, probably slightly lower than last year. But the volumes to Mexico continues strong for us. So all in all, we reported a very solid quarter and we saw solid demand, yes.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","And going forward, given how, I guess, soft sugar prices are and your competitive position, you're still fairly confident, I think, based on your comments?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Going forward in Q3, I see we expect volumes probably in line with last year and some down seasonality on Mexico, but as I said, normal year-to-year seasonality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about your capital spending plan. I know that you've talked over the last few quarters about reducing CapEx this year. I think you're running in the billion dollar range. One of your competitors on their call recently talked about -- that the industry had added a lot of capacity, greenfield capacity, over the last few years in emerging markets and that maybe the growth in volume hadn't been there really to support it because of what happened with commodity prices. So what is your take, as we look over the course of big crops this year, I'm sure we'll get big plants in Brazil next year about CapEx versus acquisitions in terms of building your -- obviously, you're making a big acquisition in Australia. But just in the emerging markets, in particular, how do you view that? Do you see additional capacity needed above and beyond what you already have in the works or are you more inclined to acquire it?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, it depends. Our preference normally, Diane, is to go and try to acquire so we continue to consolidate the market. We've done that with Elstar in Poland, we're doing now with GrainCorp as we gain access to geographies we were not present in. When we cannot find that, like in the case of Paraguay, we build. So I would say probably we could build more in terms of, for example, South America infrastructure, if ports or logistics. And in terms of processing capacity, our preference will be to buy and try to consolidate the market.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","You think now is the term to buy given that it seems like the profitability levels in South America and North America for that matter seem to be improving?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","We have had a very -- having the world as the opportunity, we track all these in our pipeline around the world and when properties get in our range, that's when we activate the processes. So we are looking at our preferred properties around the world. So I will not show my hand into saying which area we're looking at, but we have a very disciplined process to allocate that $ 1 billion.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then I guess for Ray, can you tell me what you think your optimum leverage ratio should be? I appreciate you're obviously going to have some working capital flows here coming down because of what's happened with the commodity prices. So you'll have increased cash position as you monetize higher value inventory. I guess, where do you think the optimum leverage ratio should be? And what are you going to do with your excess cash flow to the extent that Juan can't find stuff he wants to buy cheap enough?","Ray G. Young","Diane, I've always indicated that in this industry, it's very important to have a strong balance sheet. And hence, maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings is important priority for us. And so when we look at our leverage position -- again, we look at leverage, there's balance sheet metrics, there is income statement metrics. We look at those things very, very carefully. I think our balance sheet metrics right now are very, very strong. Some of our income statement metrics are a little weaker because we're still living through the residual impacts of the 2012 U.S. summer drought. But going forward, if you think it about, this company is a cash machine when it comes to generating cash. When you look at the past couple of years before the drought, we were generating $2 billion to $2.5 billion in cash flows before working capital and before CapEx. And so if Juan wants to look for investment opportunities, there's no doubt about that. But even with those investment opportunities, assuming we continue to grow this company and generate the cash flow, I do feel that we'll have opportunities in the future to provide additional returns to our shareholders. We always believe in a balanced approach towards investing the free cash flow of this company between internal projects and for our shareholders.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess, what's behind the question is I kind of thought you were already getting that done in terms of maintaining your investment grade rating with the leverage ratios that you had previously. So I'm just trying to get a feel for it, the reason why you made such a significant debt paydown this quarter is because you're positioning your balance sheet for the closure of GrainCorp, or is it just an overall more conservative kind of step-down in where you think your leverage ratio should be...","Ray G. Young","No, no. I don't think you should read that. We're preparing ourselves for GrainCorp and we're preparing ourselves for potentially a very fearful [ph] harvest where there'll be some significant opportunities for us to invest in inventory to benefit from that carry. So that's what we're preparing the balance sheet for those opportunities right now.","Patricia A. Woertz","Diane, I'll even reinforce what Ray has said. It's not a more conservative approach at all. I think we need to think about as year end approaches the year, there will be some significant needs for cash. And we are positioned to take care of those with a very strong balance sheet.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just to return to the working capital question. As we think about the year, how should we think about that number? If you can help me again with the trajectory of that working capital needs given the larger crops?","Ray G. Young","It's tough to estimate that Ann, because it will be a function of what the opportunities look like as we get to the fourth quarter, the timing of the harvest. So that's part of the reason why I want to make sure we have full balance sheet flexibility right now because we could build up significant inventories if the opportunities were there or it could get delayed. So it's -- I don't have a point estimate in terms of what our inventory balance will be at the end of the calendar year. But I can assure you that if there are opportunities, we will take advantage of it.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","That's great. And then ROIC at 5.7%, I think you said in the quarter or the trailing 12 months. Is that 200 basis point target still a good target? Or does that need to be adjusted?","Ray G. Young","No, no. It's still a good target. The way I kind of loo at it, I think our conditions -- again, we're still living through the residual impacts of last year. I kind of view ourselves pretty well near the trough right now. And so to the extent that we're still earning our whack at the trough, I think that's not a bad performance. Going forward and look towards 2014 when you get back to more normal conditions with greater earnings power and our continued focus on ensuring their invested capital base is low, I'm confident we're going to see improvements in the future.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then will you comment on the relationship between sugar and HFCS, the gap -- the price gap you think where consumers were considering switching from one to the other?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Listen, when we look at these, there is always a small volume maybe in Mexico that some of the people switch. But in reality, most of our customers prefer to deal with the liquid. And we're very closed to a big corn crop that probably will bring all those prices much more in alignment. So we shouldn't magnify the impact of this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with CL King & Associates.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First of all, arguably, your second quarter was probably, just from a timing preview, probably your more -- would have been your most challenging quarter. Delayed harvest here, though, is probably reality in the third quarter. Now I'm really focused on 2014, but in the near term, you had really good soy crush margins 1 year ago. You did lose money in ethanol in Q3 1 year ago, but could the third quarter be a little more challenging than you may have anticipated earlier?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Eric, Juan here. Listen, Q3 presents a lot of challenges for us. Think about we are still dealing with the big inverse that we need to deal through. Yes, we're going to have something a big growth, but in the places where we are located which is in the corn belt, the harvest will probably happen late September, beginning of October, which is more Q4 tilted. So I would say, Ag Services will continue to suffer through low margins in Q3. And we're going to some pressure increasing in oilseeds as we fight with a very tight balance sheet. So Q3 will still be a tough quarter where we'll not see the full relief of the harvest yet.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, exactly. And it's just a transition quarter anyway. It really reflects last year's crop harvest. It's nothing to do with the going forward. But it also looks like you moved a fair amount of high-cost grain through your P&L this quarter. And if we can get anywhere close to what -- if we can put in the bin what the harvest numbers and projections are this year, you're going to be replenishing with a lot lower cost grain. So it seems like you should be pretty well positioned on your inverse. Is that a fair assumption?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","We like to say yes. We like to think that we manage well through the inverse. I think that the guys have done a good job of reducing inventories as we face these. I mean, you've seen it in the balance sheet. You've seen it in the billion dollar challenge. So I think we have a very experienced teams that know how to work through this and that's where our footprint and our integrated model shines. So we feel pretty good.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just a quick question for Ray. Ray, you were 50 basis points below WACC on returns in the quarter, which given the seasonally and cyclically very depressed Q2, that was a big performance. Is there any way to quantify what your cost cutting and your return measures, your working capital improvements may have benefited your return numbers in the quarter year-over-year?","Ray G. Young","We haven't quantified it exactly, but there's no doubt reducing our invested capital base contributed significantly towards our results here. And then the prior cost cutting that we did last year and as Juan indicated, we've made good progress towards the next $200 million challenge. Clearly, these help in terms of helping with the earnings, the numerator of the calculation here. So I do believe both -- all the actions we've taken, it's helpful, the numerator, the denominator on your ROIC calculation. It's the exact -- how many basis points. I mean, we haven't calculated that, but clearly it contributed towards these results.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes -- no, I'm sure it did. One final question. Just remind me what are the 3 countries that were still -- you're still waiting for, for regulatory approval for GrainCorp?","Patricia A. Woertz","We have one already received in Australia, which is the ACCC, the Competitive Commission, and we're waiting on FIRB, the Foreign Investment Review Board, so that's one. The second one is South Korea, and the third one is China or with MOFCOM.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions, one is just on corn processing for forecasting. You used to earn in corn sweeteners $500 million of profit a year; it's been more like $300 million lately. And with corn costs coming down, I would think that there might be a little bit of a benefit coming your way, if you can capture it in your pricing. So I want to know what's a normal level of profit for that? And then second, on share repurchase, why not be more aggressive in the market buying back your stock right now? I know you want to keep your balance sheet free to buy a lot of corn. But the value -- the price of that corn is going to be radically lower and you're going to have a lot of cash coming in. So why not step up at this moment when your PE is quite cheap and the outlook looks good?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Robert, Juan here on sweeteners. You know sweeteners have been -- consumption has been declining in the U.S. so we've been doing, I think, a good job of balancing capacity and demand with exports. And we think the situation will be stable going into next year. Again, a lot will depend on this relationship between corn and sugar. And we believe that with lower corn prices, we will have opportunities, as I said, to increase exports and increase conversions and increased inclusion of corn products in all the supplications. So we feel good about it. I'm not going to speculate on a specific dollar range for the business, but I think the business should continue to perform solidly going forward.","Patricia A. Woertz","And Rob, on your share buyback question. I don't think the GrainCorp acquisition and share buybacks are mutually exclusive at all. I think we're dispositioning ourselves. And we did do some share buyback this quarter and I think the possibility of pace and amount can potentially increase as we go forward in 2014.","Ray G. Young","Rob, as I indicated, I think we've got very strong balance sheet. Where we have some pressure in our credit metrics is really our earnings metrics. And frankly, as we kind of get through this year and into the new year, our earnings metrics are going to improve and I think that's going to give us a lot more flexibility.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question for you on ethanol and E15. I guess, as you talk to, I guess, some of the gas stations offering E15 kind of what the demand has been like and what the price differential is for E15 and how much lower can prices go or the spread between ethanol and gasoline with the lower cost of corn? So I think, I guess at some point you're going to need the demand pulser from the consumer. And I guess, what is that price point that kind of gets them involved, which otherwise could back up the supply chain and then leads to an oversupply in ethanol?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Juan here, Ryan. I would say we continue to work very closely with everybody to try to help and facilitate as much as possible the incorporation of E15. That is like a $1 range right now, a $1 margin that they can profit from. And we've been -- I'm going to leave the economics to them in terms of what to do. But we've seen, for example, in people that price -- I think I mentioned it before during the call, for people that price accordingly and competitively, we've seen some of the people working in E85 farms tripling their volume in a very short period of time. So the consumer is very hungry for a reduction in gasoline prices and when they see the opportunity, they take advantage of that. So I think that this dollar delta is a big incentive. And with cheaper corn going forward or a more competitive priced corn going forward, this will present to me a huge opportunity for people to introduce either E85 or E15 more into the usage of the day-to-day American. So we see it with optimism.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For taking the follow-up, it's quick. Juan, just to be clear, I apologize. You almost answered this question, I think, 3 times but I still don't know the answer. In 2014, if we had $5 corn, will HFCS be priced at a discount to Mexican sugar?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I don't know exactly what's going to be sugar prices, but I would say it will probably be competitive in that sense. I don't know the calculation off top of my head, David.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to pass the call back to Ms. Patricia Woertz for closing remarks.","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, everyone, for your interest in ADM.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Case McGee, Vice President, Investor Relations, for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Mr. McGee, you may begin.","Case McGee","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's call will be available at our website, adm.com.","For those following the presentation today, please turn to Slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results. And our President and Chief Operating Officer, Juan Luciano, will review the drivers of our operations' performance in the quarter, provide an update on actions that are improving returns and discuss the outlook going forward. Then the team will take your questions.","Please now turn to Slide 3. I will turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia A. Woertz","Well, thank you, Case, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 and adjusted segment operating profit of $819 million. Our net earnings were $533 million or $0.81 per share, and segment operating profit was $888 million.","In the second quarter, the ADM team continued to execute very well and delivered strong results. We capitalized on robust ethanol demand, our recovery of U.S. grain export volumes and continuing strong demand for oilseeds products. I'm very proud of the work that the team has done recently, not just in running the day-to-day business, but also strengthening the enterprise with aggressive cost and cash management and positioning our company for future growth. This work continues to drive improved returns with this quarter's ROIC showing a 200 basis point improvement over last year.","Since our last quarterly call, we've announced the construction of a sweetener and soluble-fiber manufacturing complex in the Chinese port city of Tianjin. We've announced the completion of the Toepfer deal and the start of integration there. And we have announced an agreement to acquire WILD Flavors, a global leader in natural flavors and flavor systems, to complement ADM's existing texture, nutrition and functional solutions. It is through these and other actions that we are improving returns. These are efforts that, in a minute, Juan will discuss a little bit further. Now looking at the second half of 2015 (sic) [2014], the crops in North America and Europe are developing very nicely, and we are preparing for what could be very large harvests.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks, Pat. Slide 4 provides on financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.77 compared to $0.46 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $819 million, up $198 million or nearly 32% from last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 28% compared to 29% in the second quarter of the prior year.","Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 7.7% improved from the 6.9% at the end of the first quarter and also significantly improved by 200 basis points from the 5.7% at the end of the second quarter last year. As we indicated during our first quarter call, we have introduced the annual WACC concept for calendar year planning that is reflective of a single A capital structure and the interest rate environment at the beginning of the year. For 2014, our annual WACC is 6.4%. Our long-term WACC is 8.0% and is reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. In addition, we've added the concept of economic value added to our key metrics. In the second quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average EVA was $345 million based upon adjusted earnings and the annual WACC. On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share.","For this quarter, LIFO represented a $73 million pretax credit as commodity prices decreased through the quarter. Additionally, we recognized $31 million in pretax costs related to the upcoming global headquarter relocation and restructurings and integration underway at Toepfer and at Alliance Nutrition.","We also note in the appendix the net timing effects for the quarter, primarily related to ethanol. In total, the net timing effects for this second quarter were about $0.07 per share positive. In the absence of these net timing effects, the adjusted EPS for this second quarter would have been $0.70.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. I would like to highlight some unique or specified items in the operating results. Juan's discussion of operating results will exclude the specified items and net timing effects, so that you can understand the underlying trends in the business.","In the oilseeds segment, mark-to-market timing effects in cocoa were negligible for the quarter versus a gain of about $11 million, or $0.01 per share, in the same quarter last year. In the corn segment, we again separated out our net timing effects. In the second quarter, we benefit from the mark-to-market losses on ethanol hedges recorded in the first quarter that were related to second quarter sales of ethanol. In addition, we had some corn hedge ineffectiveness losses. The net impact was $70 million in positive timing effects or $0.07 per share. Included in ag services segment results was again related to recovery of about $17 million of a $22 million loss provision originally established in the second quarter of last year.","Let me also touch on a few items of significance in the corporate line. In the second quarter, interest expense was lower due to lower borrowings. Unallocated corporate expenses were higher, in part due to some reclassifications of costs into corporate and the lack of some onetime favorable items recorded in last year's results, but also due to higher project costs related to the start-up of our ERP program, some higher costs relating to trueing up some credit loss provisions and some increased R&D expenditures within the quarter. As we discussed earlier, we had $31 million of charges related to the global headquarter relocation cost accruals and restructuring and integration costs at Toepfer and Alliance Nutrition. But these charges are down significantly from last year when we recorded an initial FCPA provision and also had some losses on FX hedges related to GrainCorp.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. We present here the cash flow statement for the 6 months ended June 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year. We generated just over $1 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first 6 months of 2014 compared to $0.7 billion last year. Working capital changes were basically flat so far this year compared to a source of $1.6 billion last year.","Total capital spending for the first half was about $400 million, which is slightly lower than our 2013 spend of $458 million, including small acquisitions. We indicated in early July, with the announcement of the WILD transaction, that we will be reducing the capital spending in 2014 to about $900 million before the ERP program expenditures, down from our original $1.4 billion plan. After changes in working capital and investments, our free cash flow for the first half was about $585 million.","In February, our $1.15 billion convertible debt matured and we paid down this debt, contributing to our overall debt reduction. In the first half of this year, we spent about $500 million to repurchase 11.5 million shares, and we paid out more than $300 million in common dividends. So far in the first 6 months, we've returned more than $800 million to shareholders. And even with the WILD acquisition, we're on track to return the $1.4 billion that we indicated in our 2014 capital plan.","We finished out the quarter with an average of 659 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. But at the end of June, we had 655 million diluted shares outstanding. We have approximately 6.5 million more shares to repurchase this calendar year to complete our 18 million share repurchase target.","Slide 7 highlights the balance sheet as of June 30 for both 2014 and 2013. Cash on hand was approximately $2 billion, similar to last year. Our operating working capital of $11 billion was down $1 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $700 million related to lower inventory prices and about $500 million related to lower inventory quantities, offset by a net increase of about $200 million in other working capital items.","Total debt was about $5.6 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $3.6 billion, down significantly from the 2013 level of $5.5 billion. Our shareholders' equity of $20.2 billion is slightly over $1 billion higher than the level last year. And our ratio of net debt to total capital, excluding cash from gross debt, is 15%, much lower than the June 30, 2013, level of 22%.","We had $7.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to almost $10 billion of liquidity. Clearly, we have a lot of financial flexibility related to our balance sheet, and we will be able to easily finance the WILD acquisition.","Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Thank you, Ray. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. I will start with segment operating profit and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments.","In the second quarter, our underlying segment operating profit was up sequentially. An improvement in all 3 major segments drove an overall improvement of 32% year-over-year. I'll walk through those results now.","Starting on Slide 9, the oilseeds team delivered a solid quarter, with very good crush margins around the globe. North America has a very strong performance as the team earned good margins in both soybean and canola crush. In South America, good domestic demand supported high capacity utilization and good margins in soybean crushing, refining and packaging. Slower farmer selling limited South American origination results.","In Europe, we saw good crush margins for softseeds, with good meal and oil demand. The U.S. biodiesel industry ran at lower rates, while demand for biodiesel in South America and Europe was good. Our lecithin and protein specialties businesses both delivered their best quarters ever. In cocoa, the margin environment remained good. And our results from Asia reflect the lower first quarter by Wilmar.","Please turn to Slide 10. The Corn Processing team delivered yet another strong quarter. Ethanol saw great margins and volumes with good domestic demand, driven by gasoline consumption and blending economics. Once again, ADM's scale and logistics expertise allowed us to ensure a steady supply to the blenders, despite the challenging logistics environment. And U.S. ethanol's competitive price in the global market led to continued strong export demand. This quarter also benefited from some very favorable pricing we booked during the first quarter.","The sweeteners and starches team optimized their product mix and leveraged lower net corn costs to maximize volumes and margins despite lower average selling prices. In the quarter, we saw good demand from sweeteners and starch customers in both the forward and the spot markets, and we run our plants at high utilization rates.","Slide 11, please. In the second quarter, ag services results improved overall. In the year-ago period, low crop supplies limited U.S. exports. This year, good crop availability and competitive prices supported significant increases in exports. In the second quarter, we also saw higher export volumes sustained longer than normal, following logistics challenges in the first quarter. Toward the end of the second quarter, we saw the beginning of the seasonal decline in U.S. volumes that typically runs until the harvest.","International merchandising continued to improve, and we began work to fully integrate the Toepfer business into ADM as we completed the acquisition of the remaining stake in early June.","In transportation, the strong U.S. exports also supported southbound barge freight rates and utilization. We also had good northbound demand.","Now on Slide 12, we wanted to briefly update you on our actions that are driving improved returns. We focused those efforts in a few areas: strengthening the business, managing our portfolio and growing the business.","In the area of strengthening the business, after meeting our goal of $200 million in ongoing cost savings by end of 2014, we determined to double that goal. We are on track to achieve a total of $400 million in ongoing cost savings by the end of the year.","In the area of managing our portfolio, we are advancing regulatory approvals for our acquisition of WILD Flavors, which we expect to have completed during the fourth quarter. At the same time, we are working with the WILD team to prepare for the launch of the WILD Flavors and specialty ingredients business unit. That segment will include the WILD business, as well as ADM businesses that are already operating with a customer intimacy strategy.","Toepfer integration is progressing smoothly as we are merging our operations globally and working to eliminate overlaps. In May, we announced an agreement with Synthetic Genomics to commercialize Omega-3 DHA for the food supplement and animal nutrition markets. The partnership may create another use for our Clinton, Iowa fermentation assets. We have completed a successful laboratory trial and are moving ahead with the pilot run in the plant.","The sale of our South American fertilizer to Mosaic is on track to close by the end of 2014, and we expect to have signed agreement by the end of the third quarter to sell our global chocolate business.","Our efforts to improve returns also involve investing to grow the business. Pat mentioned our sweetener and fiber plant in Tianjin. That's on track to begin sweetener production early next year. In Brazil, we began construction of our specialty protein complex, and at our port in Northern Brazil, we have received all permits and approvals. We have begun receiving trucks, and this week, we are loading the first vessel.","So we're making good progress to strengthen the business and we're seeing that reflected in our returns today.","Please turn to Slide 13. We're looking forward to a busy second half. We see strong demand for our products with favorable ethanol economics, sustained global protein consumption and continued demand for specialty ingredients, and plentiful crops will rebuild inventories, making our products even more competitive versus substitutes. We're monitoring geopolitical events in Argentina and Ukraine. So far, we've seen little, if any, operational impact from those situations. And we expect U.S. export volumes to rise significantly in the later months of the year. We are optimistic as we prepare our global operations for the coming quarters. We have the assets, the net worth and the team to deliver a strong second half. Pat?","Patricia A. Woertz","Thank you, Juan. So in summary, the team again executed well. Another great quarter from corn, very good results in oilseeds, a strong recovery in ag services. We're looking forward to our close of the WILD Flavors acquisition, and we're preparing for what could be a very large harvest in Northern Hemisphere. We've made great progress on improving returns, and we continue to take more actions to drive further improvement.","So with that, Melissa, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christine Healy with Scotiabank.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Just the first question is just on the U.S. crop, the large one expected this fall. Can you talk about what you guys are doing on your end to prepare for it and prevent some of the logistical issues that happened last year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Sure, Christine, yes. Obviously, we've been watching this crop grow with very favorable weather. So we've been doing maintenance to all our operations to make sure they are all ready and the same with all the transportation networks. You know that there have been issues with transportation in the past. I think that we assessed them last year in Brazil, and we saw the improvements this year of what we did in Brazil. We're doing the same thing here in North America, talking to the railcars, aligning our trucking transportation, our barges. And as you can see in our transportation results, that -- we think that's a competitive advantage of ADM and provide normally opportunities to us. So we are looking to this harvest and to the second half of the year with a lot of optimism.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on Wilmar, I think it's been a while since you guys given us an update. I know you guys have planned on setting up, I think, several joint ventures with them on oilseeds and fertilizer, ocean freight. Can you give us an update on how that's been going?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, sure. Wilmar, we continue to work very closely. Not only we created the Olenex fats and oil joint venture in Europe, we have advanced things like joint procurement of certain items that allow us to leverage our combined scale. We continue to work on 2 or 3 other projects that include potential projects in North America and in Asia. So all in all, very good relationship with Wilmar. The results that you've seen here are their results of the first quarter. We reported with 1 quarter delay, and we previewed those results in the last calls with analysts.","Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one. Just the new port terminal in Northern Brazil, can you remind us what the annual capacity of that is?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, at the moment, it's 1 million tons, and we have an expansion plan to get it to 6 million tons. So we're very proud that, that had received all the approvals. It's receiving trucks this year and we loaded the vessel this week. And we're going to receive -- be receiving barges by Q2 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I want to talk about ethanol for a moment. In the quarter, the margins, excluding the hedge effects, were something like $0.31 a gallon, according to my calculations. Spot was about $0.70. So Juan, can you talk a little bit about the performance of the business versus spot margins? And then specifically, what I'm just trying to understand is how this might evolve going forward in the next couple of quarters.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Sure, David, yes. I would characterize the performance of the team as very, very good this quarter. The way I tend to think about it, David, in terms of the math for calculating cents per gallon, you take the $141 million of profitability of the bioproducts segment. You need to add the $70 million of mark-to-market that would relate it to hedges of sales for the second quarter, so there were ethanol sales for the second quarter. That takes you to about $220 million. We have a capacity of 1.7 billion gallons per year. So that's kind of the way we think about it. In terms of what did we hedge or not hedge going forward, going into this -- second quarter, we were about 50%. Going into Q3, we have about something like that and very little for Q4 at the moment.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So just to make sure I understand this. The reason that you want to add back that change in the hedge timing is because you're saying that truly economically, that $70 million really belonged in the second quarter. So add that back to the $141 million number to get ethanol profits, that's kind of close to about $0.50 a gallon. And then since we continue to see pretty high spot margins, is that level somewhat sustainable, at least given your 50% hedge comment in Q3?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. First of all, on the first part of the question, that's the correct way to think about it. Those were second quarter hedges. So the true economic is -- require that you add both things to see the performance of the business. The second is, yes, we see sustained margins for the rest of the year, so we're very optimistic about the second half.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Final question for me is just simply ethanol exports. Can you guys give us an update on your logic? Maybe we've seen a little bit of weakness here in exports here in the third quarter, but curious what your full year forecast is and how you might see 2015 ethanol exports industry-wide.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. We continue to see very good level of exports. Actually so far, we are in that range of about 850 million gallons to 1 billion gallons per year. We see -- this is a time of the year, David, that you should see Brazil being much more aggressive here. And actually, we continue to see us exporting, even exporting a little bit to Brazil. You probably have heard that Brazil have increased, or has a proposal to increase, the blending rate, part to try to import less gasoline and part to try to help the sector. So we continue to see opening opportunities and opening markets for us. So we are bullish for our export forecasts for 2014, as I said, about 1 billion and also for 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam of Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Pat and Juan, you both mentioned the large U.S. harvest. And we've gotten several questions from investors on how we should think about ADM's earnings opportunity, particularly in ag services, between the benefit of a large harvest versus maybe less dislocation of grain needs around the world. Could you just compare and contrast the opportunities and earnings power for ADM in that environment?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. I think we have a very good footprint in the U.S. that is not only about elevators, river terminals, export terminals, and certainly, all our transportation footprint. So you only get the power of all that asset footprint when you have a large crop. So we believe that this crop will give us the opportunity to collect income, if you will, from several parts in our value chain. I think that you are correct in the sense that there are good crops around the world, so there are less opportunities. Weather has been very, very favorable for growing crops around the world, which is a good thing. We're going to have plentiful of crops around the world to be moved. There's going to be discontinuities though. You have the issues of quality in wheat, for example, that will present opportunities for our people to blend and to take advantage of opportunities. You have the issues with freight that provide opportunities for freight arbitrages. So we see this with very good eyes. I mean, it's a -- crops look fantastic. Our assets are in very good shape and very well located. So it should be -- it should have ag services hitting in the high side of the range certainly.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. So net, a large harvest is better for ADM because you get to utilize your assets just much more fully?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","I would say so, yes.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just circling back on ethanol, could you just update us in terms of what you think production is running at, and if you think there's any additional capacity build coming online in the U.S., and how you just think about that supply-demand balance for this year and into next year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. We think that this year, total production will be around 14.3 billion gallons, something in that range, probably. Recently, it's been running a little bit higher than that because this is a high driving season. I think that EIA estimates are, for this year, about 134 billion or 135 billion gallons of gasoline. So 13.5 billion, you take the billion gallon of exports and you are there pretty tight. So certainly, this is an industry that is running as hard as they can at about 14.7 billion, and you can argue whether that's sustainable on an average for the year. In terms of new capacity, we don't believe there's going to be any new capacity, if anything, that you would see. People are already maxed out and hitting their permit levels or their baselines in terms of that. So if you add more capacity to that, you are just creating ethanol for export markets, and that will be fine since that doesn't affect the local balance. So we are very optimistic about ethanol margins being sustained at very good levels.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And my final question relates to the RFS. There's news that potentially, the RFS is going to the President's desk. Any thoughts on what blend levels will likely be relating to the RFS? And any outlook for 2015 RFS levels?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","No, Farha, we won't speculate on that. I just can tell you given these economics and with lower corn prices, ethanol is so advantaged that we'll continue to have a way in the fuel market. So export will continue to be the driving force behind margins here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's tough to beat a dead horse, but ethanol again. I'm just curious if there's any reason why you wouldn't be hedged into fourth quarter. We're watching oil prices decline and ethanol prices more likely to trade with oil prices going forward. I'm just curious, is there a reason why you wouldn't be hedged further out?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","No. Normally, when we start, we see the liquidity of that. So it was not that much liquidity. We normally, at this time of the year, we probably are -- this time of the quarter, about 50% for this quarter and maybe 20% for the Q4. And as more liquidity gets and we see the margins, we might put a little bit more on that.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So it is related more to the liquidity issue.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then separate question on the corporate charges or costs. Can you just walk through each of those and give us some more color? You talked about reclassification of costs. Could you just explain what those are, update on where you are on the ERP implementation and then the credit loss provisions? If you could just give us some kind of a waterfall, that will be great, or as much color as you can.","Ray G. Young","Yes, Ann. I mean, we're up about $38 million year-over-year on unallocated corporate. Of that $38 million, over $20 million of it is really related to these, let's say, one-timers and reclassification of costs. One-timers from last year of people, one-timers from last year, that we don't have this year and reclassification of costs. And some of this reclass really relates to certain costs that originally were in, let's say, the operating segments that we took into corporate in order to make it simpler to manage. So case in point, some of the maintenance agreements for software and IT contracts, we basically centralized it into corporate. So that's just an example. So the majority of that delta is really related to these issues. We have started launching the ERP project, so there's some additional costs there, I mean, year-over-year, roughly $5 million. So it's not a lot, but it adds up. We had some additional R&D expenditures. We're trueing up some credit provisions. I mean, all these are small amounts, which kind of add up to cover the rest. Just for calendar year planning, it's useful for you, in terms of your estimations going forward in Q3 and Q4, to assume roughly a $100 million run rate on that particular line item in your models. So that's probably a fair assumption for you to use.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful, and that was going to be my follow-up. Just a real quick one on railcars. You own about 50% of your railcars. You lease about 50%. I'm just curious if that's similar in the U.S. or if you own just disproportionately more. And what are you seeing out there with the rail companies in terms of contracts for railcar costs going into the fall?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. We own what you described. About -- we have about half the ownership of all the total railcars that we use. We certainly have a very close relationship as we are a very big user. And we feel, as I described before, that all our transportation is an advantage. And it's not only the moving units, but also the pipeline, the way we are set up. And so we think that as situation gets tight -- and I think the rail is a little bit of an overflow, not only of the issue of oil transportation in the United States, but also the issue of trucking and the difficulty to find drivers and all that, that is pushing a little bit of rail over to -- a little bit of freight over to rail. So we see that situation probably continues as we're going to have a lot of oil production and a very strong harvest. But our guys continue to make good money out of that and continue have the customers very well served. So we let them operate. They do a very nice job of that.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So more of an opportunity, not a risk, you think, going into a big crop?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I found that the progress on ROIC very encouraging at 7.7%. But I was just wondering, Pat and Juan, how will the board and management treat the inclusion, I guess, the dilutive effect of the WILD acquisition as they're determining the ROIC run rate? And as I recall, in the 3-year LTI plan, you need to have at least 1 year where there's -- you're 200 basis points above your WACC. Will the acquisition be included in this year? Will it be included in next year? How do you think you're going to treat the dilutive effect?","Patricia A. Woertz","Rob, first of all, interesting question. I will not be able to speak for the board, but I can tell you that in the past and in all of the deliberations of the board on this subject, they take everything into consideration. So I think our calculation is, as we think forward, say, for the sake of argument, we close at the end of October, the effect of that last 2 months of ownership and not having the earnings associated with the higher capital employed would probably be about 20, 2-0, basis points effect. So yes, I think the board will definitely take into consideration as they normally would. I will comment that returns are very important and focusing priority for this board, for this management, I think, we're very aligned about that and that's, I think, the key to your question.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, it is, and I appreciate all the disclosure and the increased scrutiny on it. I think it's the right thing to do. Just wanted to see how the acquisitions would be treated. And then maybe just a broader question about the outlook for this year. Obviously, the tone is very bullish for the back half. Maybe you could help us on forecasting. Just how do you think about weighting seasonality in the business first half versus second half? You have the strong North American crop really driving things. Maybe that's fourth quarter loaded. Juan, maybe you can give us a little bit of help in that regard.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. So obviously, from an ag services perspective, Q3, I mean, is kind of a lower volume type of quarter because you are getting at the end of the crop year. And then we get all the bump of September, October, November, December and into '15. So that's where they're going to be producing the higher profits. From an ethanol perspective, it's probably very optimistic for the second half but not a huge seasonality in that sense, if you will. And then from a crushing perspective also, we're going to get a good harvest here in the United States. I think that the U.S. will continue to be the most competitive soy meal out there to be exporting. And so that's -- in general, when you look at all our operations, we've seen during second quarter very strong volumes. If anything, we've been surprised by all of our volumes. And when you see our volumes of processed, we are even trying to be careful with margins. We are up like about 4%. When we look at the grains move, we are north of 40% up. So in general, we see very good demand. The other thing that we see is that plenty of opportunities ahead of us because the farmers, in general, are very little sold so far. In our customers, to be honest, are very little bought. So there's a lot of business to be done in front of us. So we see that with very -- with a lot of optimism, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just one more follow-up. I thought one of the issues in the '13, '14 crop was that U.S. farmers added a lot of on-farm storage. Do you foresee that being an issue for this year's crop as well? Are they adding more storage? Or do you think that, that issue kind of unwinds?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. We monitor that, Rob, obviously, and we don't believe there's a significant material change in the structure of the industry. We still believe we're going to process and we're going to handle a very large crop. And the timing in which the farmer is going to sell it anyway, that's kind of the fine-tuning and our team will take care of that. But overall, we're going to be managing very large crops through our assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping to go to Slide 12 a little bit and talk about some of the actions to improve returns and dig into them in a little bit more detail. Juan, maybe first on the cost savings that you've talked about, taking the target up to $400 million by the end of the year. Can you talk about where in the P&L we should be thinking about that? And should we think about the incremental $200 million of cost savings that you're now kind of going after as being potential earnings, year-over-year earnings, upside in '15?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Sure, Rob -- I'm sorry, Adam. Listen, we have a very robust plan internally that goes actually all the way to 2019. The plan is built in like about 10 categories, including water and maintenance and repairs, including energy efficiency, including procurement. So I'm not going to bore you with all the details, but yield improvement and all that. So when we put together that, we estimated obviously that the team was starting to get going, and we estimated that about $200 million run rate by the end of '14. We are north of that year-to-date. So we certainly -- in the first quarter, we realized we are going to be way ahead of schedule as the team continues to find opportunities. And now it looks much more like, again, $400 million by the end of the year. Where do these things go? You have to find it in all the businesses, obviously. They all trickle down to the businesses. Since they are procurement, sometimes it's in chemicals. So you might find it in oilseeds by reducing the chemical usage or the chemical prices. Sometimes, you find it more in corn when there is energy efficiency. But there are new technologies applied to oilseeds to continue to reduce our costs. So I would say in general, you're going to find it in all the divisions, maybe a little bit more in the processing units than in ag services. Ag services have maybe less of an opportunity since they don't process, but they also have milling inside them that they will see the impact on that. In terms of how much of that will we see, obviously, we do all these and we spend capital and resources to see it in the bottom line. So we expect this to be accretive to next year's and the following year's operating profits.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe continuing on the slide, on the bottom, on the investing to grow: the sweetener and soluble plant, the Brazil specialty and the Northern Brazil port. Can you talk about the investment size in each and the timing of when those should start contributing to earnings?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. I don't remember exactly which ones we have disclosed or not, but let me talk about the contribution. And sweeteners and -- a sweeteners plant in China, in Tianjin, will start producing early in 2015. So you should see -- obviously, we will -- although we are developing the market with exports from here, there's going to be a period of ramping up to that. So maybe 2016 or late 2015 is when you start seeing the earnings impact of that plant. The protein specialty complex is going to be later on because we're just starting. So that will take 18 to 24 months to build, so it's more a 2016-and-a-half type of situation. That complex is a $250 million investment in Brazil. And again, it's very aligned with what you heard before, that specialty proteins have had another quarter -- another record in this quarter. We have -- we are selling very, very well and there is a lot of pull from our customers. So this plant cannot come fast enough. And then the Brazil northern port, you're going to see the impact starting this harvest -- right now, actually, we are loading vessels and the full impact is probably more important next year because we're going to start receiving barges, starting with the harvest of Brazil of next year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe one final quick one for me. The sweeteners and starches performance in the quarter was actually quite strong and maybe you could provide a little more color on where -- on what's really driving that.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. I think it's a combination of things. I think our team is very good at what they do. They have many, many levers to pull in the sense that we have the ability to flex production, not only into ethanol but also into dextrose of other products. So I think grind is up. Volumes have been tracking consistent with last year and a little bit better than projections. To be honest, when we started the year, we thought that the decline in export to Mexico was going to be bigger than what is actually happening. So Mexico has been strong. I mean, it's down versus last year about, I don't know, 15% but it's better than we expected. So we prepare for that. So we prepare with some spot businesses. We prepare with business developing other products to make sure that they offset that. And between the ethanol strength and the strengths of those other products, we've been able to offset the decline in the liquid sweeteners. So we are -- and with that and corn costs and the continuing improvement we do at the plant, that's when you get the results. So very proud of the team.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the sweeteners question. The run rate in that segment had been sort of plus or minus $100 million for a long time. I just couldn't tell from your prepared comments and also the answer to the preceding -- the previous questions whether the performance in this quarter is what we should be thinking about for the third and fourth quarter as well.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. I think that from a margin perspective, this is what you should be expecting. There is certain seasonality as you go -- as you end into the picnic season in the U.S. or things like that, you see a little bit of a change into that. But yes, from a margin perspective, this is what you should be expecting, Vince.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then could you just sort of talk about -- obviously, it sounds like the U.S. in the second half is going to be better for you with the larger crop and better preparation around logistics. But what are the, if any, are the challenges in Latin America year-over-year in the second half, just with what's going on in Argentina? And how much is that offset by maybe the new plant in Brazil?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. We -- certainly, situation in Argentina is complex, and looking at the macro scenario, we pull a little bit of risk in Argentina. So we have reduced our participation. We are a very big export in Argentina, but we pull risk a little bit off from the country and that's why we haven't been impacted significantly. The team, I think, did a good job of managing the circumstances. The -- and you said it well. It should be picked up by Brazil, and that's why we're opening the port in the north and we're very excited at about that. The problem is, circumstantially, Brazilian farmers are not selling. They are not helping with the prices. They are not helping with the real and the dollar exchange rate. So that has been dampening a little bit our origination earnings and that's what you saw in oilseeds. We think that, obviously, that they are only like 10% sold from new crops, so we will see commercialization of that later in the year, and we will -- part of that will come back to our P&L later in 2014.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just as one last follow-up, on the new port, I called it a plant earlier, but I meant the new port, you talked about the millions tons of volume. Is that going to be -- how much of that going to be incremental to your volume year-over-year? And how much of that's just going to be volume redirected there versus going to Santos?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","No, a lot of that, Vince, will be new volume. One of the reasons we're doing this, obviously, part of that is to alleviate the constraints of evacuating everything through the port of Santos. But a lot of that is also so we can increase our origination in the northern part of Brazil. So I would say, call it, 70-30, 70% new stuff, 30% redirecting stuff into better logistics.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Juan, I just have a question on the starch and milling business. I think some of -- several of your peers have highlighted very strong starch demand in Asia, and another peer has indicated that milling is an attractive growth area. I know you have a lot on your hands right now, but do you feel that ADM is sufficiently positioned in these areas? And looking out over the next year or so, are these areas that ADM may look to expand further based on some of the market dynamics that we're seeing?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes. Tim, listen, we've been -- I know that corn team has been looking at other carbohydrate sources, not only corn. Part of that we've been doing with some of our partners in Asia, exploring that. So there is a very rich pipeline. If anything, in ADM, the issue that we are dealing with is keeping the focus and the prioritization as we look for returns and having a very balanced portfolio to make sure we deliver the improving returns that you've seen. Certainly, the Tianjin plant is a plant that profits a little bit from the length of starch in the market. We don't produce starch there because we thought that at this point in time, it was more convenient for us, given the length in starch, to actually procure that starch. But we have plans in the future at the proper time to be able to back integrate that. And then we're looking -- we have teams exploring Southeast Asia for other opportunities. As I said, I think the issue has been an issue of prioritization and how do they stack up in terms of returns versus other opportunities we are pursuing right now.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And your milling results were a little bit flat, based on your press release. Do you see room to expand global capacity there? Or do you feel that you're sufficiently positioned?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Well, I think the business has a strong position in the U.S., a strong position in the U.K. and the Caribbean. So demand has been stable and very solid. So that has been a business that is very, very good cash flow, a cash cow, if you will. They've been returning very, very good. It's a team that looks a lot at how to maintain the assets because milling is kind of an old technology. So I think we had a little bit of a softer quarter. As corn gets cheaper, obviously, some of their feed products get a little bit less profitable in that sense, but now we are coming into higher seasonality for that business. And -- so -- but it's been one of our most predictable businesses and more stable businesses. So we have a very good level of comfort in the stability of earnings that they can deliver. So very good team, very good position, not much to worry about that business.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question on your comments around wheat dislocations around European wheat quality. Obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the potential for Black Sea basically backfilling for some of the lower-quality wheat conditions in France. But there's also been talk that some of this wheat could be downgraded to feed quality. And with the significant crops coming on in North America, how do you think about the competition from European wheat feed within your global network? Is that a potential risk factor that we're not thinking about in the second half?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Listen, our team -- I was checking Monday -- yesterday with our team there. They feel very good about the opportunity in the Black Sea and to fully use our assets. So the Toepfer team is very excited about it. I think that, in general, in wheat, in the world, there is adequate supply. But as you described and I mentioned before, there are delta qualities. So sometimes, there are lower protein here, and sometimes, there are smaller crops where the quality is very good. And our team is very good at equalizing all these around the world. So we see mostly as an opportunity, to be honest, not only for equalization of that or arbitrage, but also to provide the right blends to our customers. And that's what our milling team do very, very well with the combination of having a grain business associated to a milling business, so that's a very strong competitive advantage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just kind of a big picture question. As you get through the harvest, how do you see like -- when do you think that investors will get a peak into the true earnings power of ADM? Do you think it will be the fourth quarter, the first half of '15? How do you kind of progress to seeing like what you guys -- all your work has done? And with the crop coming in, in normal conditions, when do you think we'll actually be able to see some milestones from a performance point of view holistically?","Patricia A. Woertz","Yes, Ken, I think we're quite confident in our ability to continue to grow the earnings power. You're -- the last couple of fiscal years, obviously, have been challenging due to the lingering effects of the drought. We've talked about $3 a share, breaking through that. We've talked about targeting certainly our long-term objectives to be 10% ROIC because, of course, our long-term WACC is 8%. We've done all these efforts to drive results related to whether it's costs or cash or portfolio management. So I think your question is a good one. Can I pinpoint the exact quarter? Probably not. But as you look through the latter part of this year and into next year, and we hope to close on the WILD acquisition again late 3Q, by Q4, that's another $0.10 to $0.15 a share. I think you should see these accretive actions in a sustained level definitely by the turn of the year as we look for that.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, perfect. And then my other question is on the crushing outlook. This quarter -- the current quarter that we're in is usually a high maintenance quarter or obviously a slow churn. Is there -- should we expect a seasonal pullback this quarter, then come back up in the fourth quarter? Or how do you think about that just from a seasonality point of view?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think we see the normal seasonality, Ken. I think that this quarter happens as per historical averages in which the capacity -- we slow down in the U.S. And we shifted that very good crush margins in Brazil. We have a solid situation in Europe. So I think nothing very unusual, I would say.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And after the harvest, again, it's a futures market, so we don't know if it's going to stick. But the crush margins look to be in the $0.90 range relative to historical averages of $0.50 to $0.60. Do you think those are real margins? Do you think -- is there a point in time that you could actually start hedging those margins? How do you think about that? Because that seems pretty extraordinary.","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, I think it's reflecting a little bit what I described before in which we feel like our customers have -- are really uncovered in that sense. And I think that there is a lot of potential demand out there. And with the expectation of very low prices from a beans perspective, you get to some of that margin. Obviously, our team is all over that and I'm very excited about the future. Fundamentally, what you need to think about is that we've seen demand very, very solid. And that's what I think. When you see the need for soybean meal around the world, the U.S. will be the most competitive soybean mill exporter from October to, whatever, February, March or something like that. So that presents a very good opportunity. Because when you get exports, when you tip the balance in the local capacity utilization, that's when you get margin expansions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I just wanted to follow up on merchandising and transport. So in the quarter, the $115 million in merchandising, and I think transport $27 million, $142 million. Ray, Juan, Pat, maybe you guys could just comment on kind of what you really expect out of this division. I know we've had this conversation on a number of calls. But as I was going back and just kind of looking at history in this business before wheat milling was contributing to the segment, I mean, there were plenty of periods where this thing was $200 million, $300 million in profitability. Is there any real reason not to think that you can't get back to those kinds of quarterly profit contributions from merchant transport after we get this new harvest in to kind of \"recharge the system\" I think is the phrase you guys were using in the past?","Juan Ricardo Luciano","Yes, David, this is Juan. Listen, we are very optimistic about the ability. The team has put together a wonderful plan to take care of the harvest. If you see -- even with relatively low volumes when compared to the potential of Q4, they have performed already in the $200 million range. Still, there are some things that they need -- we need to get there. The wheat carries we used to have, today, are a little bit lower in magnitude versus the peak, maybe in the range of 60%. And the volumes available are a little bit lower than that. But when you think about having carries back in the market and being able to take advantage of this very significant crop, we have not reduced our footprint. So when you have a bigger crop and our footprint has expanded a little bit, we think that we have the potential to go back to previous earnings in which -- that you described. So we have no reason to believe that we cannot get back to those levels. We just haven't seen it in the last 2 years. That's why we are cautious with our forecast, but we think this business should operate in the higher side of the range.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Patricia Woertz for any closing comments.","Patricia A. Woertz","Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results as well as the drivers of our performance. Then Juan will discuss our forward look, and finally, they will take your questions.","Please turn to Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.60, down from $1.02 in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $682 million. Over the first half of this year, we faced widespread external headwinds, including extreme weather that had a negative impact of $65 million in the second quarter and $125 million in total for the first half of the year.","The team executed well to minimize these headwinds, and we undertook a series of aggressive actions that, combined with the absence of severe weather going forward, will help deliver a stronger second half and set us up well for 2020. Just as important, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives to enhance agility, accelerate growth and strengthen customer service.","Our actions this quarter expand our three strategic pillars. In our optimize pillar, we completed the significant global organizational changes announced last quarter, including further reductions in management layers, centralization of activities, the elimination of positions and the early retirement offering for eligible colleagues in the U.S. and Canada. We continued to optimize our U.S. Origination footprint, reaching an agreement with Cargill to exchange grain elevators in Illinois and Indiana, and we're seeing the positive results of the turnaround efforts at our peanut and tree nut shelling business.","In our drive pillar, we simplified our operational model by combining our Origination and Oilseeds business segments into a single business, Ag Services and Oilseeds, which we'll begin reporting in the third quarter. We also centralized our milling management and commercial teams in Decatur, which will offer efficiencies as we further integrate our flour and corn milling businesses. These actions are part of our wider simplification efforts as we continue to streamline decision-making and management structures in order to drive action and accountability. We announced a realignment of our manufacturing operations, driving standardization and efficiency by moving to a global centralized structure led by our Senior Vice President of Global Operations, who is reporting directly to me. And we continued to expand our global centers of excellence, or COEs, which are ensuring focus and expertise in key areas such as technology, talent and growth.","In our growth pillar, we completed our acquisition of leading European citrus flavor provider, Ziegler Group, positioning ADM as a global leader in the growing natural citrus ingredients market. We cut the ribbon of our upgraded nutrition flavor research and customer center in Beijing as we continued to expand and enhance our capabilities in Asia. And we continued to lead the industry with new innovative solutions for our customers. We introduced BIOSIPEC, a comprehensive system for intensive shrimp production, and unveiled a new line of renewable vegan Omega-3 blends. We also secured multiple sales wins in the areas of alternative proteins, where our products can now be found in the retail and foodservice channels on three continents.","These actions will help us deliver a stronger second half of the year, and even more importantly, they are helping us advance the transformation of our company to ensure we can capitalize on significant market opportunities and deliver strong results in 2020 and beyond.","Please turn to Slide 4. All of our strategic work as well as the processes we use to execute day in and day out continued to be elevated by our Readiness efforts. Last quarter, we reported that we had completed 185 of our prioritized Readiness initiatives. At the end of the second quarter, that number has grown to 275. Those completed initiatives will account for $500 million in run rate benefits on an annual basis, keeping us on target for our two year goal of $1.2 billion in run rate benefits. In terms of accrued benefits, today's Readiness has contributed $130 million, putting us well on track to meet our goal of $250 million to $300 million in accrued benefits by the end of this year. Finally, 1,000 more colleagues completed our comprehensive Ability to Execute training during the quarter, giving them the knowledge they need to lead our efforts to improve the company. I'll discuss Readiness more later.","Now Ray will take us through our business performance. Ray?","Ray Young","Yes. Thanks, Juan. Slide 5 provides some of the financial highlights for the quarter. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down from the $1.02 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $682 million, down 26%. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 6.9%, generating positive EVA of $42 million relative to our 2019 WACC of 6.75%. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was approximately 13%, which included transition tax benefits and other discrete items. Excluding those items, the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was about 21%. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 20%, which was our initial guidance.","On Chart 19 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our quarterly earnings of $0.42 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.60. The adjustments include a charge of $0.18 per share related to asset impairment and restructuring charges, including a noncash pension remeasurement accounting charge as a result of the U.S. early retirement program; a $0.3 per share charge related to LIFO; and $0.3 per share tax benefit related to the transition tax and certain other discrete tax items.","Slide 6 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before I go to business segments, let me touch on some more noteworthy other items. Other business results were $11 million, below the prior year period, due primarily to insurance underwriting losses, partially offset by higher ADM Investor Services earnings. Our revised full year estimate for Other is in the range of $80 million to $90 million based upon actual and expected underwriting performance, down from the $100 million level we guided earlier in the year.","In the corporate lines, net interest expense for the quarter increased as expected due to higher long-term debt levels, largely due to the funding of the Neovia acquisition. We now expect full year interest expense on a segment presentation basis, however, to be lower than what we indicated in the Q1 call, in the area of $350 million to $375 million, down from the $400 million level. Unallocated corporate costs of $132 million were down versus the prior year, principally due to lower accruals for performance-related compensation, partially offset by higher investments in IT and Readiness-related costs. As a result, we are tracking below the $700 million guidance level for the calendar year. Corporate results also include early retirement and restructuring charges of $101 million or $0.14 per share and a LIFO charge of $25 million or $0.03 per share.","Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 7. We generated above $1 billion from operations before working capital in the first six months of the year, just slightly lower than last year. Total capital spending for the first half of the year was $383 million, similar to last year. We're on track towards our revised capital spending guidance of $800 million to $900 million. Acquisitions to date of $1.9 billion are primarily related to the closing of Neovia in the first quarter. Return of capital for the first six months was about $500 million, including about $100 million in opportunistic share repurchases in the second quarter.","Slide 8 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 and 2018. Our balance sheet remains solid and continues to position us very well for the full year. Our operating working capital of $7.8 billion was in line with the prior year. Total debt was about $9.4 billion, resulting in a net debt balance of $8.6 billion. Again, that's higher than last year's net debt balance of $6.8 billion, primarily driven by the funding of the Neovia acquisition and other bolt-ons. As we move to the rest of this year, we expect to delever the balance sheet with the cash flows generated.","We finished the quarter with net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 31%, up from the 27% in the year ago quarter. Our shareholders' equity of $19 billion is up slightly from the $18.7 billion last year, primarily due to net earnings in the excess of dividends, share repurchases and translation adjustments. We have $5.8 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of the quarter. We had available cash. We had access to $6.7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our average share count for the quarter was 566 million shares on a fully diluted basis.","Next, I'll discuss our business segment performance for the quarter. Please turn to Slide 9. In the second quarter, we earned $682 million on an adjusted profit basis excluding specified items, down 26% from the $924 million in last year's second quarter.","Now I'll review the performance and outlook for each segment. Starting on Slide 10. Our Origination team executed well in the second quarter despite a raft of difficult external conditions. As you may recall, the second quarter of 2018 was an extremely strong one for Origination as the drought in Argentina and increased purchases of U.S. crops by China in anticipation of the tariffs combined to deliver very strong margins and volumes for U.S. exports.","This year, in the second quarter, the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and the lack of U.S. competitiveness, particularly for corn, limited North American export volumes and margins. However, we are very pleased with the way our recent growth investments and the teams' execution helped to offset some of those negative results. Destination marketing contributed with strong performances in Latin America and Egypt, and the contributions from trade finance continued to grow. It was a similar story in Transportation. The high river conditions limited barge volumes and increased costs compressing margins, but again the team to use the tools at their disposal to help mitigate the headwinds as much as possible. And particularly, our stevedoring business showed impressive year-over-year strength despite conditions. Overall, across the Origination segment, this quarter's high water conditions had a negative impact of about $40 million.","Now to Slide 11. Oilseeds results were somewhat lower than the extremely high results in the second quarter of 2018. In Crushing and Origination, strong domestic industry demand supported crush margins in North America and EMEA. In North America, crush volumes were down, mainly due to production outages caused by high water at the company's Quincy, Illinois facility. That high water resulted in a negative impact of about $10 million for the quarter. Crush margins in South America were substantially lower on higher soybean prices, oversupply of oils and lower export demand. South American origination margins were down on lower China demand during the quarter.","Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other results were lower than a year ago quarter, driven by weaker margins in South America and some timing impacts in EMEA. North American refined oils continued its solid performance. Asia was higher on Wilmer results.","Now beginning next quarter, we will be reporting the results of our new combined Ag Services and Oilseeds business units. We will report subsegments that will include, one, ag services, which will include North America, South America and EMEA Merchandising and Handling, including Global Trade and Transportation; two, crushing including North America, South America and EMEA; three, refined products and Other, which will include refined and packaged oils, biodiesel and our peanut and tree nut processing business; fourth and finally, we will report Wilmer equity earnings as a separate subsegment as well.","To assist you in comparisons, you will find in Slides 22 and 23 a pro forma of 2018 and the first two quarters of 2019 under the new segmentation. Now looking ahead, for the new Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, we expect third quarter results to be below last year's very strong third quarter of $478 million when we benefit from the short Argentina soybean crop. Compared to the second quarter of this year, the ag services subsegment should see improvements due to seasonality of earnings as well as more normalized river conditions, offsetting some of the minor impacts of our reserve Louisiana export facility being off-line. Our destination marketing and other value-added service businesses should continue to help offset headwinds from lower U.S. export competitiveness. Looking at the crushing and refined products and other subsegments together, we see solid results in the third quarter based upon the margins that we have locked in on crush as well as benefit from the timing effect reversals and continued good demand for refined oils and biodiesel.","Slide 12, please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were lower than those in the year ago period. In Starches and Sweeteners, the North American team did a great job growing starch volumes despite lingering impacts from the flooding at our Columbus, Nebraska complex. North American sweetener margins remained robust overall. The EMEA region continued to be impacted by low sugar prices, the Turkish quota on starch-based sweeteners and higher wheat prices. Flour milling margins in North America were down in a market environment that limited weak basis opportunities.","In Bioproducts, ethanol industry margins remained negative as the China trade situation continued to weigh on export demand and industry inventory levels remain elevated. Manufacturing costs and production volumes were also impacted by the high water at Columbus. Across the Carbohydrate Solutions segment, the impacts of severe weather in the quarter were about $15 million, 2\/3 in Bioproducts and 1\/3 in Starches and Sweeteners, all in line with our initial expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the ethanol margin environment to remain challenged, especially with the recent run-up in corn prices, until we see significant increases of ethanol purchases by China and industry production that is better matched with demand. North American Starches and Sweetener volume should remain steady. In addition, the businesses' cost position will benefit from the improvements we've made at the Decatur corn complex.","All told, we expect a third quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions that is lower than the equivalent period in 2018 and more similar to the second quarter of this year, absent any significant recovery in industry ethanol margins. On Slide 13, Nutrition results were slightly higher year-over-year. Within WFSI, WILD North America sales and margins were very strong. This was offset by changes in customer ordering patterns in EMEA and lower sales in APAC.","In Specialty Ingredients, strong customer demand in specialty proteins and fiber was offset by some isolated production and shortfalls. Health & Wellness continued on its aggressive growth trajectory, driven both by contributions from acquisitions as well as organic sales and margin improvements. The WFSI team continued to drive solid pipeline growth and deliver new customer wins by providing a range of solutions across major growth sectors, including complete flavor systems for the beverage category, plant-based proteins for the rapidly growing alternative meat and dairy segment and probiotics for our supplement customers.","Animal Nutrition results were higher than the second quarter of 2018, driven largely by the accretion from the Neovia acquisition, which was partially offset by lower margins on lysine. Looking ahead, Nutrition's performance in the third quarter should be substantially higher, approaching double that of the $67 million of operating profit in the third quarter of 2018. In WFSI, we expect solid growth in both sales and margins as the team continues to deliver new sales wins, we see increasing contributions from additions such as probiotics, vanilla and citrus and isolated production shortfalls are resolved. Animal Nutrition should be up year-over-year, benefiting from the improvements in premix margins, which were negatively impacted by changes in industry vitamin pricing in the third quarter of 2018 as well as accelerating benefits from the Neovia acquisition.","As we look at the back half of the year for ADM in total, we should see overall results that are higher than those in the first half of 2019 when we were adversely impacted by $125 million of weather-related effects. The major variable impacting our fourth quarter performance this year will be whether we will see significant purchases of U.S. agricultural products by China, particularly ethanol. We actually see the net impact to the new Ag Services and Oilseeds segment as somewhat neutral if there is a resumption of agricultural trade in the fourth quarter or not. For example, if trade resumes in the fourth quarter, the North American Origination business would benefit, but the South American Origination business may lose volumes and the North American crushing business may have higher input costs in soybeans. If we don't see a resumption of significant agricultural trade with China, particularly ethanol, well before the end of the third quarter, it would be difficult to achieve adjusted earnings per share in 2019 similar to the 2018 as it would be near impossible for the ethanol margin environment to significantly improve from where we are right now. Juan?","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 14. I'm pleased with how aggressively our team has moved to deal with some of the external headwinds that we have encountered this year. And while facing a challenging near-term external environment, we also remain focused on our long-term strategy: improving our company and positioning ourselves to capitalize on market opportunities. We are making good progress on our strategy. First, we are continuing to improve our underperforming businesses. We are seeing the benefits of our turnarounds in Global Trade, South America Origination and Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts. We have also made good progress in our Decatur complex, on lysine production and at our Campo Grande facility and see further opportunities in the back half of this year.","Second, Readiness is continuing to gain speed and is helping us make ourselves faster, more efficient and more customer-focused. For example, this quarter, in order to globalize our sales standards and improve service to key accounts, we've centralized our Nutrition sales and account activities. We're also advancing our IT foundational services, rewiring our entire IT operation to be more efficient and more effective. And we're launching a new phase of our One ADM business transformation initiative, focusing on better data to enable even faster decision-making, better processes for improved reliability and flexibility and better systems for enhanced user experiences and productivity. Our team is continuing to identify and execute on new Readiness opportunities. And as I mentioned, thanks to their good work, we have delivered significant financial benefits and are on track to meet our 2019 accrued benefit and 2020 run rate goals.","Third and finally, we're working to harvest our growth investments and ensure that they are fully delivering on their potential. We are ahead of our plan for delivering synergies from Neovia. As we continue to more fully integrate all our recent acquisitions, we are seeing increasing benefits in our business results. For example, in the second quarter, we used our new citrus and vanilla capabilities to deliver important wins in the confectionery and beverage segments. It is these actions that will allow us to capitalize on three key market opportunities that we believe will significantly impact our industry in the coming months and years.","The first, which Ray has already mentioned, is the reopening of China to U.S. agricultural food and ethanol products. I won't speculate on timing, but fundamentally, we remain confident that more normalized trade will eventually resume between the two countries. We are seeing some hopeful signs as last week; China announced the waiver of certain tariffs on agricultural products as a sign of goodwill to help advance the trade talks. And while our team has done a great job minimizing the impact of the trade disruptions today, it will benefit both ADM, and more importantly, U.S. farmers, when China once again is a major purchaser of U.S. agricultural products, including grains, meats and ethanol. In the meantime, we continue to work on the operational and legal separation of our ethanol dry mill assets as a standalone business unit that will facilitate the eventual sale, joint venture or spin of this business. The second opportunity is ASF. We discussed last quarter how China needs to cover about a 10 million metric ton animal protein gap, and that may be on the conservative side. We're starting to see early signs of how ASF could affect global markets. In the first six months of the year, meat imports into China have risen 40%; pork imports are up 30%; and poultry, up almost 50%. Europe and Brazil are among the markets that have seen sharp increases in meat exports to China. In the U.S., pork production is up 5%. In Brazil, it's approaching 6%. We've even seen meat companies upgrading production facilities to prepare for anticipated demand. This will be a large multiyear event for our industry, and we continue to believe it will support incremental demand for the global crush industry outside China.","The third market opportunity underpins much of the portfolio transformation we've made at ADM over the last five years: meeting the needs of a population that is both growing and becoming more affluent and conscious of what it eats and drinks. That change requires more than one kind of solution. Growing populations in developing nations require more basic foundational nutrition, while the growing middle-class is looking for foods and beverages that are natural, sustainable and support good health. Thanks to the changes we have made and are making, ADM can meet all of those needs. Today, we have a value chain that encompasses more of the human and animal nutrition market than ever before, the broadest portfolio for the present and future of food. We're a leader in plant-based proteins, and we're excited by the demand trends we are seeing in that fast-growing segment and the opportunities they create for a wide array of ADM ingredients. We're a leader in bioactives, in enzymes, in natural flavors and colors, in fibers. And of course, it's critical to remember that we continue to lead in the foundational products that we've been in for the last 100 years. In short, we are uniquely positioned to meet the world's growing and changing nutritional demands.","Slide 15, please. Our core beliefs at ADM has always been consistent, but as the world's needs have evolved, we have evolved with them. We therefore revisited how we express those beliefs. Today, this is how we identify our purpose as a company: we unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life. That is both a novel cause and a commitment, and we are creating a company that is purpose-built to meet it. By ensuring that all our businesses are strong, by improving the way we operate through Readiness and by ensuring that the growth investments we have made delivered both for ADM and our customers, we will be able to serve our novel propose to nourish the world, while at the same time, creating value for our shareholders by delivering growth in earnings and returns in 2020 and beyond.","With that, Lisa, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research.","Heather Jones","I guess I want to just start on ASF. So you mentioned that you had seen early signs of that impacting feed demand. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of your estimate of the magnitude of supply that was -- that will be ultimately lost. How is that tracking relative to your initial expectations? And could you give us a sense of when you think the increase in feed demand will be of size enough to positively benefit ADM's business?","Juan Luciano","Yes. Thank you, Heather. The ASF situation is evolving pretty much as we expected or as we described in the last quarter call. The herd loss estimate in China continue to grow, and now we're talking -- last time, we talked 20% to 30%. Now we're thinking maybe 35%, and there are reports of even higher. There's also the expectation that production will continue to drop into 2020. We see that this is spreading not only inside China but also to other countries, and we have heard, of course, about Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.","We've seen domestic corn -- pork prices in China rising, and they've risen already 30% to 50% in that range year-to-date. And in the last month, it basically raised 15% versus the previous months. We've seen imports accelerating in pork. June reports about 62% increase in imports supporting to China. As we described before and we imagined, we saw the initial beneficiaries being Europe and Brazil, and they experienced export growth in the first five months of the year. Europe is up 41% to China. Brazil is up 29% in the first six months of the year.","We've seen other imports coming into China in the first half. Poultry is up 49% from Brazil. Beef is up like 120-something percent with Australia, Argentina and all those countries supplying. We have seen delegations of Chinese officials looking at production facilities in Brazil and giving new permits for exports. At least we have seen about seven of those. We have seen China approving poultry exports from Russia, pork exports out of Argentina. We have seen increase in soybean meal in -- rations in China and the U.S. We have seen increase in weight on hogs in China, and we have seen a strong poultry production in China.","So my point is it's developing as we expected. On the question of when it's going to impact our assets and the assets around the world or outside China, I think that China has done -- we have seen a little bit of a suppressed issue so far because China has inventory of frozen meat and because everybody that had a healthy live pig was basically sending to slaughter just before it gets infected, so to a certain degree, helping in moderation of the impact that we expect to be cut in the second half when the frozen meat inventory ends.","We have said it before. We thought that maybe at the end of August, beginning of September, we may see that impact increasing. When it's going to get -- so naturally, it's going to increase first in Europe and South America, and we may see a potential impact in North America later on.","I think that we will see an increased impact in demand in late Q3, early Q4 in the market with the full impact really being in 2020. So as far as we can tell, that is the best information we can provide, Heather, right now.","Heather Jones","No, that's very helpful. And then I just have a detail-ish question. Ray, you mentioned that corporate expense is tracking below your original target. I was wondering -- and I did hop on late so you may have said this and I missed it. But anyway, could you give us more specific color on what you expect that to be, unallocated corporate for Q3 and Q4?","Ray Young","Yes. I think we're probably running around $175 million per quarter, around that area there on average for the last two quarters of the year based upon the kind of the run rates that we're seeing.","Heather Jones","So Q2 was more like a true-up quarter?","Ray Young","Yes. Q2 was a true-up, and then Q3 and Q4 -- again, we're going to be below $700 million, but -- so when you kind of work the average itself, it's going to be around $175 million, around that area there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","It's actually Steve on for Vincent. [Indiscernible] if I ask a follow-on, on the other corporate line -- I'm sorry, the unallocated line. You mentioned that it's going to kind of go back to the run rate in the back half. So was the shortfall in the second quarter, was that just all accrual on the comp side? Or...","Ray Young","Yes. It's mainly a true-up, right? So it's a onetime true-up. And so that's the reason why when you get back to a normalized run rate, it will be running lower than what we thought. But that's why I'm saying, well, $175 million per quarter of the last two quarters approximately.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then maybe just a question on U.S. crop production. So lot of focus on planted acreage and bushels. Given the crop got in late this year, are you seeing maybe some increased risk on test suites? And can you comment maybe on whether or not that may kind of flow through your P&L in any shape or form?","Ray Young","No. I think that -- and clearly, include the crop got in late. And then USDA numbers, a lot of people are looking at that. And the USDA will be coming up with the revised estimate in acreage coming up. I mean our internal viewpoint is that the acreage will come down, particularly in corn, and so probably into the mid-80s, around that area there. And what's interesting on the yield side, we still believe that the current estimates of yields are probably reasonable at this point in time. And part of the reason is like with the seed technologies and genetics, it's amazing what the -- what yields can be. So I mean our viewpoint is that, yes, acreage will come down on corn. It may creep up a little bit on soybeans. Yields are probably be in line with the USDA numbers, but we'll see. Again, we're in a critical pollination stage right now of corn, and then we'll see if -- ultimately where things will end up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Larson from Buckingham Research.","Eric Larson","So the question that I have, and I -- this is starting to come up more and more. The longer our trade disputes go on with not just China, but Mexico and Canada and basically around the world, it changes behavior from not only our export partners but also the producers in those countries. And it's hard to gain share back if this continues to go longer and longer. If -- are you seeing any of that? We just saw some estimates come out for production for -- estimates for F '19, '20 production for Brazil next year. They're talking 125 million metric ton production of beans and then 100 -- over 104 million of corn, which is again, that was in the big records. And I guess my question is if we end up losing market share around the world, does it kind of change the way, one, you think about your global asset mix? And would you may have -- would you have to do some zigging and zagging to be able to account for those changes of global production?","Juan Luciano","Yes. Thank you, Eric. Yes, I agree with you, and we have highlighted this issue with the trade dispute is that people trying alternatives. And eventually, they become a little bit more comfortable with those alternatives. So this is not good for the U.S. farmer. This is not good for the percentage of U.S. in the export markets, and we hope it's going to be resolved soon. I think that the U.S. is still a very large producer and still very important to the world. So we are not past the point in which we cannot recover where we are.","Regarding expansions around the world, don't forget that the U.S. is very strong. The U.S. dollar is very strong. That also pushes a little bit production to other countries, and we have seen it over the last maybe 5 to 10 years in which more emerging countries have grown, helped a little bit by the lack of competitiveness of the U.S. exports given the strong dollar. So some of that dynamics we have been dealing with. And so we've been expanding into Europe. We've been expanding into Brazil and South America. But I think that fundamentally, it hasn't changed dramatically our view of the future. We continue to make the company better. You have seen in our Origination results how some of these new services have popped up and presented good improvement versus last year, whether it's the destination marketing, whether it's stevedoring, whether it's trade finance. And so we continue to adjust our earnings.","I will say you've been -- you've seen our investment in Algar in Brazil, and we continue to look at these things. As I said, I don't think it's too late, but we certainly encourage both countries to get to the table and continue discussions and find out a solution for the sake of the U.S. farmer.","Eric Larson","Okay. Good. Then the final question is there's a lot of other things going on in China. And I think we've talked a little bit about this. Now you've got -- their corn inventories have fallen quite sharply. I believe they were as many as much as 230 million metric tons four, five years ago, and maybe that's now below 100 million metric tons. Looks like they could be having some production shortfalls, maybe armyworm is having an impact. it sounds like it's continuing to get worse. And then you've got -- you're flowing in feed demand over there at least in the near term until they rebuild that herd. Can you kind of talk how that impact might be on Wilmer? How that might affect world trading patterns? I mean there -- are those incremental factors that we might not be accounting for at this point, Juan?","Juan Luciano","Yes. It's hard for me to comment too much on Wilmer since I'm an insider, being in the Board. But I would say -- I would remind you, Wilmer has a very diversified business model. So whether they are in tropical oils and they are in sugar, in consumer pack, and they are in 13 countries in Africa through associates and all that and also in India. So I would say it's hard to pinpoint exactly one point making a significant impact on Wilmer. So we're still very, very bullish about our ownership there and their prospects for growing, especially their investments in China into the future.","When you think about China, you described it correctly. I think their corn inventories have dropped and armyworm continues to spread in China. Although I think if the farmer will follow the recommendations of the government, there are tools to correct that. But they still need to apply all those pesticides.","I think the other issue that you didn't mention that I think is important in the dynamics bringing China into the equation is ethanol. China has put this mandate of 2020 in ethanol. They really need it for breathing air quality, and I think that they will come through with that. That creates -- as you know, you have heard me saying before, by 2020, they will have 50 billion gallons of gasoline demand. 10% of that will be about 5 billion gallons, of which they internally can produce about 2 billion of it. So they may import 2 billion to 3 billion gallons between Brazil and the U.S. So that is the trigger or the thing that the U.S. margins need for actually get out of this load that we are in, in terms of ethanol margins. So that, to us, is the biggest impact of a potential resolution between the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. And it is a no-brainer because it's a win-win. China needs this to comply to -- with their promises and their goals, and the U.S. needs this to help this industry and to help the U.S. farmer. So I think that's something that we put a lot of faith on because, as I said, it makes a lot of sense and because there are no other way for China to get this product from the world. Brazil will not be able to supply 3 billion gallons overnight.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Simonitsch from JP Morgan.","Thomas Simonitsch","So looking at U.S. export volumes in Q2, particularly in corn, how much of that weakness do you attribute to supply challenges and the weather as supposed to market demand?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Tom. I think that the river logistics in general caused an abnormally slow U.S. exports in Q2. And so I will put a lot of the blame in the weather because regardless of the demand that was out there -- and we couldn't have a competitive fray it to even participate in that because we couldn't deliver. So I would say -- I certainly put a lot of the weight on the weather.","Thomas Simonitsch","Okay. And just following up on ethanol. Absent exports to China, what actually can turn things around for you in that business? In particular, can you comment on your assumptions for -- small refinery exemptions in 2019?","Ray Young","Yes, John. I think the -- we're starting to see -- with negative EBITDA margins in the industry persisting, you're actually starting to see smaller refineries, ethanol refined shut down now. And so if these things persist, I could see more capacity coming off-line. I mean this industry is not sustainable long term with negative EBITDA margins. And so as we kind of look through the rest of the year, and as you know, normally, July, August, summer driving season, normally, this is the peak period in terms of demand and this is normally when inventories actually come down, right? But if you take a look at our inventory levels in the industry, we're actually up versus last year, the middle of the year. So I do think that there is going to be more pressure on the industry to reduce production just simply due to negative EBITDA margins.","I do believe that the focus on cost -- and that's what ADM has been doing, we're focusing on driving cost down in our ethanol productions. And so therefore, from our perspective, we're carefully managing production relative to margins with a focus on making sure that we're one of the low-cost producers in the industry here. I mean the small refinery exemptions are out there. We think that -- and actually, that's a negative for the industry here. We hope that as we kind of proceed forward in terms of looking at, for example, E15 -- year-round E15 in order to try to drive some incremental volumes and look for more export markets, in Mexico, as an example, and actually, Juan talked about China. I mean the industry needs to continue to expand the markets around the world in order to try to find additional volumes for the industry.","I mean, just for perspective, I mean, the industry has practical operating capacity of low over 17 billion gallons. And we're running -- right now production rates is around 16 billion gallons. And so I think there is an opportunity for the industry to further consolidate in the future as we kind of move through the next months and years of industry here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.","Kenneth Zaslow","It's Ken Zaslow. Just a couple of questions. My first question is can you talk about the cost savings program? It seems like you are doing more aggressively on the cost savings program. How is that progressing? Is that -- how much is going to be falling to the bottom line? And how does that set you up for 2020 in terms of earnings potential? Can you start there?","Juan Luciano","Sure, Ken. Yes. So Readiness and -- continues, and then we feel very good about how we're tracking for the $1.2 billion run rate benefit by the end of 2020 as originally outlined. We are on track on run rate. We are on track on accrued savings in the 2019. And fundamentally, I think it's spreading around the organization, bringing simplicity and bringing everything that you see in all changes: the consolidation of milling with corn into Carbohydrate Solutions and the moving of some of the people in milling to Decatur to consolidate that makes better decisions, avoid about duplications, the consolidation of Origination with Oilseeds. I mean -- so the reduction in P&Ls, the standardization around the company. So when we look at 2020, if you compare it to 2019, Ken, and why we feel good about it is think about that this year, so far, we had $125 million of weather impact that hopefully, in a normalized weather environment, that will not repeat next year, so $125 million. The full year interventions that we did with the early retirement window and some of the positions consolidations that we had has an annual impact of $200 million, of which $80 million will account in 2019. So you have an extra $120 million for the full year of that coming into 2020. Then you have Readiness that we expect -- in order to complete that $1.2 billion, we expect about $200 million to $300 million be in the 2020 accrued results for Readiness.","We still have some improvements area that we need to put behind. We have this year impacts on Decatur, impacts on lysine that we -- they're going to be completely resolved by the time we get, of course, to 2020. So that will be about $50 million, give or take, that we're now going to have. And then we're going to have some of the full impact of some of the investments that we have made in either Campo Grande from a growth perspective or even in Ziegler and Florida Chemicals, on Neovia that will add another $100 million to $150 million. So even when you account for maybe extra IT investments or extra inflation next year of about maybe $100 million, just to make it simple, I could see about $0.5 billion to $600 million OP improvement or about $0.70, $0.85 per share improvement versus what we see here, provided, as I said, normal weather conditions that -- I'm sure we're not going to getting exactly that, but just for our reference of how I'm thinking about 2020. That helped you? Is that helpful?","Kenneth Zaslow","Yes. The $125 million for the weather, just to be clear, is -- that is the actual logistics? That's not talking about bases and all the other...","Juan Luciano","No. No. That's basically Transportation and the impacts of our plants being down by not being able to produce on them because of either flooding or extreme cold.","Kenneth Zaslow","Yes. But that doesn't include the basis, the run-up because it is hard to get product? It doesn't...","Juan Luciano","No. No.","Kenneth Zaslow","So all the market-related issues relative to the weather, does that include that?","Juan Luciano","No, absolutely not. This is just lost production.","Kenneth Zaslow","Can you put a framework about what you would think weather would have been just on the market conditions? Or is that too hard to do? I just feel like there's [indiscernible] in there, too.","Juan Luciano","No. I think I will be guessing at this point in time. I don't want to. No.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken","Just wanted to sort of touch base on the Neovia side and really the Nutrition business. It looks like you're saying that Neovia is on track to meet your prior growth target. So does that mean that the rest of the business would have been down, excluding Neovia within Nutrition? And if so, could you talk to some of the factors why?","Juan Luciano","Yes. So we are very pleased with Neovia. We are going through the integration process, and we identified -- remember, when we launched this or when we announced the acquisition, we talked about \u20ac50 million of synergies by year four. We continue to say that we're probably going to achieve the same amount in half the time, so in about two years. So we're going to exceed the synergy targets.","When you look at the impact, we're very pleased with the impact. The negative impact that we have had in our P&L, in our legacy, Animal Nutrition P&L, is certainly ASF got impacted pricing in lysine. And we still have some issues with finalizing the fixes on the plant here in Decatur.","Also, Michael, you need to remember the last year from the previous -- so the first half of last year has a big boost on some of the vitamin issues that happened in the industry that we took full advantage of. That was a one-off, of course, because of a fire. So that, we don't have it this year. So I would say in Nutrition, in general, things are going as expected. I think that Ray mentioned it before. It probably was a little bit disappointing quarter given some of the customer timings that we faced. We were expecting a little bit more of that. We also have a little bit of a shortfall in a couple of our plants mostly because we were trying to run that at very high levels and explore some of the high levels, and we couldn't ramp-up as quickly as possible.","On the customer timing that we saw in the Q2, we have seen already July came back strongly and August maintaining the forecast. So we think that those issues are going to put be put behind already in Q3. So we feel good about how the Nutrition platform is developing. Customers are looking for more healthy solutions, so supplements are going well. You look at our growth in Health & Wellness in OP is astronomical. We look at all the demand from alternative proteins that are coming, not only driven by the desire of the consumer to experiment with something new, but also by the shortfall in proteins that we have in the world right now with more than 10 million tons coming. There is renewed interest in alternative proteins, and we have the broadest portfolio of alternative proteins.","And to be honest, when we formulate alternative protein solutions, we benefit a lot from being integrated into flavors, into colors, those -- texturizer, those are important products in the formulation. So feeling very good about Nutrition actually. And I think Ray mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect Nutrition to have a significant year-over-year improvement in Q3, and we're still seeing that.","Michael Piken","Okay. Yes. And just a follow-up on that one. Like could you maybe quantify a little bit in terms of what the market opportunity might be for ADM in terms of plant-based proteins? What type of growth rate we might expect from Nutrition in the outer years, either a volume basis or a need basis?","Juan Luciano","Yes. So think about it. If we look at QSRs and people asking for more alternative burgers, if you will, I mean, they have a climb recently of about 10%. So we see ourselves very well positioned in that area. Our teams are expecting growth of about 25% in that area. It is relatively a new phenomenon in that sense. We've been supplying alternative proteins for a very long time, but some of this excitement about the alternative burgers are a lot driven by start-ups. So their volumes are still not huge. So we haven't -- you haven't seen all of that in our P&L yet, but we are exceptionally positioned to do that.","We have about five plants of different proteins around the world, whether you count soy-based proteins or pea protein or edible beans proteins. We have two plants that are just ramping up at this point in time, so you haven't seen it in the P&L yet. You're going to see the full benefit of that in 2020 and 2021. So you should expect a big contribution from that -- a big growing contribution from that in our P&L over the next two years.","Operator","Our final question today comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","So a lot of ground has been covered. I was hoping to -- so first, just Readiness and some of the reorganization and maybe just a little bit more color on the -- or -- and actual business level impact of consolidating Oilseeds and Origination. And I guess moving the Brazilian Origination under a different home is probably the biggest single change there, but just making sure I understand kind of -- was there a meaningful cost opportunity? I don't think either one had a meaningful headquarters function. But just strategically, kind of what has that enabled you to do that you weren't doing previously?","Juan Luciano","Yes. Listen, Adam, I think that the combination of two businesses -- so first of all, let me clarify on Brazil. Origination was in the P&L of Oilseeds in Brazil, so they have been run and integrated. But now it doesn't change much in the sense that the rest of the world now matches the Brazilian model, if you will. So everything is in one P&L. I guess what you have to see here is the same, as I said, trend that we showed when we put together corn with milling in Carbohydrate Solutions. It's our trend towards simplification, towards making decision-making better and avoid duplication and reduce the silos, if you will. So I think that the teams are making better decisions.","There is certainly cost savings on that, but I will say more importantly is the further refinement and coordination on risk management processes, reducing the level of internal transactions. Sometimes, we have too many of those transactions. There are some businesses that have in excess of maybe 40% of the total transactions just being internal. So imagine the simplification in terms of processes and documenting and processing all these transactions. And certainly, centralizing some of the decision-making in the Global Trade and all that, having both businesses making this -- or having the same view is very important. So regardless of how well they were communicating before, that is absolutely seamless today. So we're very pleased with the early stages of that.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just in Oilseeds. And you covered a little bit of this in the conversation around ASF, but just would love to get kind of the forward view on the crush outlook around the world as we go into the second half and the first half of next year. And specifically, kind of what impact does a -- if any, does a smaller U.S. soybean and crop and a trade deal or lack thereof with China play into that outlook?","Juan Luciano","Yes. So let me start by addressing that in parts. So from a trade deal perspective, I think Ray mentioned also before and it's our belief that -- now if we look at the combined unit of Ag Services and Oilseeds, the impact of resolution or no resolution is kind of will be a little bit muted. It may be a little bit better for Origination in North America. If there is a resolution, a little bit worse maybe for Oilseeds in North America and for Origination in South America and vice versa. I think the biggest impact of the resolution of a trade dispute with China will be on ethanol, and that is how we believe it's going to play out.","In terms of Oilseeds, in the U.S., we're feeling very good about it. As you know, board crush rallied during the quarter and then came back to where -- basically where it started the quarter. We had an opportunity during the quarter to book some margin levels for Q3, so we have good confidence and good visibility into what Q3 is going to be. Q4 is a little bit more open, but demand continues to be strong. Nutrition -- I mean, soybean meal demand, we expect outside China to be somewhere between 3% and 4%. So it continues to be very good. And soybean oil demand remains strong as well in the U.S. So we're also going to have the North American harvest in the Q4, which normally bring increased availability of soybean. So -- and regardless, there is a huge carryout of soybeans in the North America. So we expect that any potential spike in basis will be short-lived in that sense.","If we look at the different regions, if you will. So we look at -- Argentina and Brazil crush margins are very much played right now by the farmers selling that has been very slow in both places. I will say in general, around the globe, the farmer has been a little bit like last year in corn selling, but in soybean, they have been a little slower. And particularly in Argentina, we're going into the elections so there is a lot of uncertainty about what's happening with the peso there. So Argentina crush margins dropped to about $10 to $12 gross.","In Brazil, we have the situation that domestic plants are having better margins. There has been a little bit of a slow farmer selling as well there. Brazil had made progress in the pension reform. That strengthened the real, and that basically slowed down farmer selling again in Brazil, which I think is a positive for the country overall for fighting the deficit. But certainly for the releasing of beans had been a little bit more difficult. So when you look at the difference between the domestic plants, they have been -- they are positive territory, about $15 or something like that. But export plants are basically pretty much at breakeven given that they need to chase beans and they are fighting with a strong competition from Argentina for meal.","In terms of Europe -- crush margins on Europe, in terms of rate, it remained challenged as we see a much, much firmer seed basis given there is a poor crop in the EU. So -- and maybe additional oil content is a little bit lower than usual, meaning that we need to use a little bit more seeds to do that. Soy crush margins remained about $15 to $20 spot, and there is a lot of competition from Argentina there this time of the year. And we still haven't seen the full impact of the ASF increase in demand that I think we would see. So I think at this point in time, an increase in margins in Europe will come from either a basis normalization or reduction on the basis or a little bit more demand due to ASF coming forward. So that's maybe a long-winded answer to the -- going around the world in oilseeds crushing.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back to Victoria de la Huerga for closing remarks.","Victoria de la Huerga","Thank you for joining us today.

I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.57, up 39% from the prior year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $658 million.","I'm extremely proud of the results our team achieved this quarter. Under some tough conditions, we were able to deliver strong growth in earnings and returns. In fact, it was our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year higher returns on invested capital. We did this by continuing to deliver on our strategic plan and capitalizing on improving conditions in some markets.","Ag Services was up for the quarter, with improved merchandising results globally. Our Corn business delivered another strong quarter earnings growth. Oilseeds results decreased on less favorable global soybean crush margins and South American origination.","WFSI earnings were in line with the prior year quarter. In addition, I'm pleased to announce that we had our safest month on record in June, with an improved safety record year-to-date over last year.","Our actions in the first half of the year reflect ADM's continuous efforts to create shareholder value and set the competitive standard in the industries in which we operate. We are diversifying our capabilities and geographic reach through acquisitions and organic expansions. We recently closed on our acquisition of French sweetener company Chamtor, expanded our destination marketing footprint with the acquisition of Industries Centers in Israel, and announced the construction of a new flour mill in Illinois.","We're also aggressively managing cost and capital and taking additional portfolio actions. And we are ahead of pace for meeting our 2017 target of $225 million in run-rate savings.","We implemented over $130 million in operational run-rate cost savings during the first half of the year while continue to invest in R&D, innovation centers, and process improvements. And in line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we returned $875 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.","Because of all these actions, we expect to deliver a strong year-over-year earnings growth and returns in 2017, and we are poised to be an even stronger company in 2018. I'll provide more detail on our results later in the call.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.57, up from the $0.41 in the prior-year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $658 million, up $85 million from the year-ago quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 28% compared to the 29% in the second quarter of the prior year.","Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.8% is 100 basis points higher than the same period last year and 80 basis points above our 2017 annual WACC of 6.0%, thus generating positive EVA of $195 million on an annualized basis. Our ROIC has continued to improve for the fourth consecutive quarter.","On chart 19 of the appendix you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share. For this quarter, we had a $0.04 per share net charge related to an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business partially offset by the gain on the sale of the crop risk services business. We also had $0.04 per share charge for impairments, restructurings and settlements, and a $0.01 charge related to LIFO.","Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the corporate items affecting our quarterly results.","Net interest expense was up approximately $18 million to $81 million primarily due to higher short-term interest rates, our overall mix of short-term and long-term debt following the issuance of our new fixed-rate debt in August of last year, a favorable interest rate expense adjustment last year, and some additional interest expense related to foreign income taxes due from prior years.","Looking ahead, we're continuing to project net interest expense of approximately $320 million for the full year 2017, consistent with what we indicated at the beginning of the year.","Unallocated corporate costs of $134 million were up versus the prior year and modestly below our $140 million per quarter guidance for fiscal year 2017. The increase is primarily due to the planned increased investments in innovation, IT, and business transformation. Minority interest and other charges increased to $35 million primarily due to updated portfolio investment valuations in CIP.","Turning to our cash flow statements for the first six months on slide 6, we generated $1 billion from operations before working capital changes similar to the prior year. We had favorable changes in working capital of a bit over $300 million. Total capital spending was $452 million. Our current expectation for fiscal year 2017 is capital spending of approximately $1 billion.","Acquisitions of $180 million were primarily related to Crosswind Industries, a pet treat manufacturer; and Chamtor, a French producer of wheat-based sweeteners and starches.","We spent about $511 million to repurchase shares and including dividends, we returned $875 million of capital to shareholders by midyear. Our average share count for the quarter is 574 million diluted shares outstanding, down 20 million shares from this time one year ago. At the end of the quarter, we had 571 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.","Slide 7 shows the highlights of our corporate balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 and 2016. Our balance sheet remains solid. Our working capital of $7 billion was down $1.2 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was $7 billion, resulting in a net debt balance of $6.3 billion. Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%.","Our shareholders' equity of $17.4 billion was down slightly from the $17.7 billion last year, due primarily to returns of capital shareholders in excess of net earnings. We had $5.1 billion in available global credit capacity at end of June. If we add available cash, we had access to $5.8 billion of short-term liquidity.","Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thanks, Ray. Please turn to slide 8. In the second quarter, we earned $658 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, up from $573 million in last year's second quarter. Second quarter adjusted segment operating profit was up almost 15% versus the year-ago quarter. We continued to see improving conditions in some markets throughout the year, as well as benefits from the actions we have taken and continue to take, as we execute our strategic plan.","Looking at the first half of the year, despite muted margin conditions persisting for some of our businesses, adjusted operating profit was up approximately 17%.","Now, I'll review the performance of each segment.","Starting on slide 9, Ag Services was up over the prior year period and delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases in operating profit. Merchandising and Handling returns were higher versus the year-ago quarter. North America grain results increased significantly over the prior year with a strong carries in wheat, corn and soybeans. We are seeing the benefits of our actions to improve the performance of the global traders.","The group generated solid profitable results and was up over the year-ago quarter. Good execution led to improved margins that more than offset some lower volumes. In addition, favorable timing effects benefited results. Destination marketing is on pace with our Egyptian joint venture, Medsofts delivering a strong quarter.","Transportation decreased over the previous year primarily due to river conditions and lower freight rates. Milling and Other delivered solid results with modest growth over the prior year driven by solid margins and favorable merchandising in North America.","Please turn to slide 10. Corn Processing had another strong quarter with results up from the year-ago period. Our Global Sweeteners and Starches business performed very well. Higher volumes and improved margins in North America Sweeteners and Starches contributed to a strong performance. In addition, our European operations showed positive growth as a result of increased sales volumes.","Results from our sweetener complex in Tianjin, China improved modestly over the year-ago quarter with good growth in sales volumes reaching full utilization levels during the quarter. Bioproducts results increased over a weak prior-year quarter, one with slow production. Ethanol margins improved significantly due to lower production costs and increased industry exports. Animal Nutrition was up over the second quarter of 2016 driven by improvements made in the Specialty Feed Ingredients business.","Slide 11, please. In Oilseeds Processing, the business benefited from diversity of feedstocks, products and geographies. However, overall results were down compared to the second quarter of 2016. Crushing and Origination results were lower. Global crush margins remained pressured due to alternative protein substitutes, slower first-half growth in meal demand and a competitive global marketplace.","In South America, when the Brazilian real dropped in value for a brief time in May, we saw more aggressive farmer selling. But in general, throughout the quarter, the real remain firm contributed to compressed South American origination margins.","On the other hand, our softseeds performance improved over the previous year as we continued to utilize our flex crush capacity to capitalize on margin opportunities. And Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Others which is our value-added oilseeds business, continued its consistent pattern of earnings this quarter with solid results in all regions.","Refined and packaged oils in both North America and South America were higher over the year-ago quarter with higher sales and strong margins. North America Biodiesel results were up in the quarter, largely due to unfavorable timing effects from the year-ago period.","Our global peanut business benefited from improved shelling margins and good results from our specialty products and oils businesses. In addition, Asia experienced another good quarter, growing significantly over the prior-year period due to our ownership stake in Wilmar.","On slide 12, WFSI results were in line with the prior-year period as we continue to build the business globally and to invest in innovation and exceptional solutions for our customers. WILD Flavors delivered another strong quarter with double-digit profit growth and higher year-over-year results in every region around the globe, powered by 9% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.","Specialty Ingredients was down for the quarter. We have seen improvements in some businesses. However, results were impacted by some production interruptions and startup costs for new facilities.","We continue to build and expand our capabilities in the WFSI platform. We're investing for the long term, including by creating new customer innovation centers, adding talent, developing new product applications and building new facilities such as Campo Grande and Tianjin. These actions are positioning the business to be a leader in flavor and specialty ingredients which is able to reach a broader range of customers as its portfolio expands.","We are seeing how combining WILD Flavors' natural flavor systems and ADM's nutrition, texture and functional solutions is positioning us to respond to local consumer preferences and for a complete food and beverage solutions. We are making ongoing enhancements to WFSI's operations and customer offerings. And with a significant project pipeline, we are confident we will continue to see strong growth.","Slide 13, please. Before I update you on the progress of the strategic plan, I like to remind you of a significant number of actions we have taken on our business portfolio to evolve ADM for the future. During the last three years, we have dramatically increased our capabilities further down the value chain, starting with the WILD Flavors' acquisition in 2014 to Harrell Nut Company, to Eatem, Caterina, Harvest Innovations, Biopolis and more.","We have increased our capacity and geographic reach. In EMEA, we added AOR to expand our packaged oils capabilities. We purchased and then expanded corn processing facilities out of our former Eaststarch joint venture, and added further to our sweetener footprint with the acquisitions of Chamtor and in Morocco.","We expanded our logistics and destination marketing capabilities with Medsofts in Egypt, Industries Centers in Israel, and our ports on the Black Sea. We're building facilities in China. We added Amazon Flavors in Brazil. We acquired Crosswind Industries in the U.S. And we have increased our ownership stake in Wilmar International, a very successful processing and consumer packaged goods company focused in the emerging markets.","And we have divested businesses that we believe were unlikely to meet our long-term return's objectives including cocoa, chocolate, South American fertilizer, our Brazilian sugar operations, and crop risk services.","In the meantime, we have continued to invest in R&D and innovation, in operational excellence, in our business transformation, in all of those things that will help us set the competitive standard by industry.","So, turn to slide 14 please where we will provide an update on some of our accomplishments this quarter. As you can see, we're continuing to execute in our three primary areas of focus. In the area of optimizing the core, we completed the divestiture of our crop risk insurance business while retaining our ability to offer customers a full array of ADM's grain marketing services.","In Santos, Brazil, we made a series of enhancement that will improve our operational efficiency at our export terminal.","And, today, we are announcing that we will be reconfiguring our Peoria ethanol complex to focus on the more profitable, high-grade industrial and beverage alcohol and also export fuel. By doing this, we will reduce ethanol capacity by more than 100 million gallons, and we will also have a more simplified production process for the Peoria complex.","We have achieved more than $200 million of monetizations in 2017, and we continue to be on track to achieving our $1 billion monetization target over two years that we announced in 2016. In addition, this year we are converging two very important activities, operational excellence and business process transformation, into a strategic initiative called Project Readiness.","We have talked in the past about how we have been driving operational excellence into our manufacturing and supply chain activities to help reduce costs. In fact, year-to-date, we have generated operational cost savings of over $130 million on a run-rate basis and are ahead of pace to meet our 2017 target of $225 million.","We have also talked in the past about our business process transformation program called 1ADM. This year, we have rolled out the project to our North American corporate finance activities and are currently introducing the program to several processing businesses in North America, and we are in the design and planning stages for Europe.","The convergence of these two activities into Project Readiness will allow a more coordinated approach towards establishing how ADM will drive improvement in our businesses and functions that will be even more efficient, more standardized and with a focus on customer excellence.","As you saw in the prior slide, since 2014 we have been quite active with our business portfolio as we have acquired many companies, divested various businesses and made investments in various segments and geographies. Because of this, we decided to step back and look at our overall structure.","So, as part of Project Readiness, we have taken another look at our structure organizational levels, spans of control, degree of centralization of activities, organization of various staff activities and leadership. We also looked at the allocation of resources between businesses that are more mature and businesses that are growing. With this review, we identify areas to streamline and areas where we need to invest even more resources including people resources, and we took steps to ensure we have the right resources in the right places.","As part of this effort, we'll reduce certain positions within our global workforce, and align the organization to enable us to continue focusing on innovation and growth.","In the area of strategic growth, we have announced or completed several important projects. We closed on our Chamtor acquisition which expands our sweeteners and starch footprint in Western Europe. We have once again expanded our destination marketing capabilities by acquiring a controlling interest in Industries Centers, an Israeli company specializing in the import and distribution of agricultural products. And we announced that we will be building a new state-of-the-art flour mill in Mendota, Illinois.","As mentioned earlier, our Campo Grande protein facility in Brazil and our Tianjin, China fiber operation will increasingly contribute to our growth in the second half of the year. And as part of the strategic growth, I have appointed Ian Pinner to the position of Chief Growth Officer. He will focus on helping us drive additional growth into the value-added spaces and work very closely with Vince Macciocchi on our Ingredients teams.","In addition, Ian will continue to oversee our ADM ventures arm which focuses on making investments in new food and feed and bioactive platforms.","So, this highlights several of the actions we took in the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress regularly.","So, before we take your questions, I would like to offer some additional perspectives on the next quarter and the balance of the year.","First, I'd like to say how proud I am of what this team has accomplished, particularly in delivering 39% EPS growth this quarter. For us to be able to do this, even while conditions were less than ideal, speaks to both the great work of our team and the pay-offs of our strategic plan that we continue to execute. We feel good about where we are and where we are headed.","In Ag Services, we anticipate overall Q3 performance to be down versus a strong prior year period, although an improvement from this quarter's results. South America's large crop will continue to pressure North American exports in the third quarter. Absent any major dislocation event, we continue to expect it will be a very competitive global environment in the third quarter. However, strong U.S. corn and soybean production may present merchandising opportunities in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We expect international merchandising to continue to deliver favorable results. So, overall, we continue to expect performance in Ag Services for calendar year 2017 to be better than 2016.","In Corn, we expect third quarter results to be up over 2016. In Sweeteners and Starches capacity in North America remains tight amidst solid demand. We will see some benefits from the addition of Chamtor and continue to see positive momentum in Asia.","Ethanol margins are expected to improve in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to seasonal demand. As I mentioned earlier, our production levels will change in Peoria and with high levels of industry inventory entering the quarter will probably run our plants to maximize yield.","For full year 2017, we still believe results will be significantly higher than 2016 even with the weaker than expected ethanol margins in the first half of the year.","Looking at the third quarter for Oilseeds, we expect results to be up over a weak year-ago period. The third quarter results could be similar to this year's second quarter. We expect soybean crush margins to be improved in the second half of the year as meal demand growth rates are projected to increase. However, they will continue to be margin pressure from competing proteins and strong Argentine exports.","In South America, we anticipate improving farmer selling as there are still significant corn and soy crops to be commercialized. And our second half numbers could benefit from the positive resolution of the U.S. biodiesel blenders' tax credit for 2017, as well as the NBB antidumping and countervailing trade case and the European WTO dispute on Argentina biodiesel import tariffs. Our full year outlook for Oilseeds is for a much stronger performance compared to 2016, but not as strong as 2015.","For WFSI, third quarter results are expected to be better than the year-ago period, and WFSI is on track for a record calendar year of performance.","WILD Flavors should continue its pace of double-digit percentage operating profit growth.","Specialty Ingredients is expected to recover from a slow 2017 start.","The Campo Grande, Brazil facility should start incrementally contributing to results as soon as the complex gets fully operational in the second half.","So, in conclusion, I just want to again acknowledge the ADM team for delivering a strong improvement in earnings this quarter and the first half of 2017. We are successfully navigating through some challenging conditions while continuing to invest in projects, innovations, and processes for the future. We were still able to return capital back to the shareholders and keep a strong balance sheet.","I'm expecting a strong year-over-year earnings growth and returns in 2017. And ADM is poised to be an even stronger company in 2018 with the collective actions that we are taking. And we'll remain confident that as we execute our strategic plan, we will be able to deliver on our long-term ROIC objective of 10%.","With that operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Your line is open.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, Heather.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Hi. I don't want to waste my only question, but I did have a clarification. Did you say Oilseeds for Q3 you expect it to be similar to Q2?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Correct, Heather, yes.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. And then going to the Peoria announcement, could you flesh that out further? So, are you taking \u2013 from what I heard, you're reconfiguring that to focus more on industrial and beverage grade alcohol as well as ethanol exports but the net-net will be you will be taking 100 million gallons of ethanol production out of the system permanently?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. You understood it correct, Heather. We are taking basically the ethanol that we're producing for domestic use, about 100 million gallon of that out of commission immediately.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. So, you're saying 100 million gallons for domestic use but like when we're thinking about total capacity for ADM, what's the net reduction as opposed to shifting it to -","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","It's 100 million gallons.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you so much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome, Heather.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe a short and longer term question on Oilseeds. I know you talked about some improvement in \u2013 some competition in the back half but some improvement on better meal demand. But, I mean, can you talk about the longer term opportunity here to get crush margins back up and kind of what it will really take to see higher ex-China utilization to maybe either get margins to a level that would incent new capacity and really improve your own base performance?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Adam. Listen, looking forward, we're seeing obviously seasonal positive North American dynamics in Q3 and Q4. We're going to have good bean availability, and we expect a strong domestic demand in the second half. We saw a little bit of the softer demand in the first half with probably \u2013 excluding China \u2013 about 1% up year-to-date. We're forecasting ending the year about 1% to 3% excluding China.","When we include China, we're thinking about 3% year-to-date performance. And when we look at 2018, maybe more important to your question, we're looking at about 5% mill demand growth including China. So we see that continues to go strong.","We have taken this year the impact of the DDGs' shift from China not importing that anymore. So we absorbed that, and we also for the most part, have cleared with all the inventory of low quality feed wheat that was competing for milling to that. So, we feel good about how we have transitioned during this quarter. It was a relatively tough quarter for crushing, and we're moving into 2018 with better dynamics for that business.","I also would like to emphasize maybe the importance of the flexibility that we have in ADM. We crush eight seeds in ADM, and we have seen in times like these where maybe soybean crush margins are subdued, our ability to shift capacity to others where is softseed margins improvement, but also our portfolio, and you probably noticed in our chart about the contribution of value added that has been brought by bottle oils, blended oils, and another products. So, I think we feel very good about the growth rates of mill going forward.","Certainly, protein demand, consumption, look at the increase in soybean imports from China. That's probably the best indication of true protein consumption every year there. So, we feel good about the long-term fundamentals and we feel good about how our business is operating and how diversified it is to take advantage of this opportunity. So, we're strong in Oilseeds going forward.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I appreciate the color, Juan. And maybe just an Ag Services question. I know we still have a couple months to evaluate the full size of the U.S. crop, but it does look like the combined U.S. corn, soy, wheat production will be lower than the prior year with some large competition, especially for corn and soy, exports from South America. Can you talk about from 4Q onwards as things are shaping up, the carry opportunities, Gulf elevations, and just how the mosaic is shaping up as you look at the new crop environment?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Sure, Adam. Yeah. Very good question. Listen, I said before, we are very proud of how the Ag Services business have navigating through all this. This has been the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. And at times, we've been very critic about the things we needed to improve. And I think the team has delivered on that, and we can with a better cost position and better operating performance to ourselves.","As we look at the second half, we do believe that the exports will be a little higher than 2015, but certainly lower than 2016 from the U.S. because we're going to get all these potential exports from South America during Q3.","Even as we consider that, we see the improved performance of our global traders into the second half. We've seen good wheat and corn carries in the U.S., as you describe it. We see continued increase in our destination marketing volume is growing 10% over year. And we're going to get the bigger contribution from Medsofts that is operating very profitably and now from our majority position in Industries Centers in Israel. We're going to see higher exports for us from Argentina in the second half and we didn't have that benefit in the first half.","So, we feel strongly about that. We see that our Ag Services business will benefit from our ability to segregate high-quality wheat as we go into the second half. So, again, we're thinking higher growth versus \u2013 I mean, bigger earnings than last year, probably more tilted towards Q4 than Q3 where the opportunities for North America will be bigger.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. That's helpful color. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Does your commentary regarding the reconfiguration of your ethanol assets in Peoria have any implications for the divestiture of the dry mill assets? And if not, can you provide an update on the process?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, Sandy. No, actually, it doesn't have any implications other than this plan has been removed from the consideration because we have considered already fixed in the sense that that reconfiguration allow us to focus on the profitable products that we wanted to maintain, and take that capacity out of the domestic ethanol market.","In terms of the other process, we don't have any updates at the moment to be honest. We have been analyzing that. Remember we said we were looking at the potential impact of tax reform, and we were given that a little bit of time to see if we could see any movement from the administration on that.","So, at this point in time, the financials have been carved out. We understand the financials of those business, and we continue to look for opportunities to have a transaction there with no rush. I mean, the business is performing well or improving the performance. So, we have no rush, but no announcement at this point in time.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then what drives your expectation that ethanol margins are going to improve just given that we're in the heart of the summer driving season and margins are down very significantly year-over-year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I think we see an \u2013 we've seen an improvement that we started in Q3. I think that when you look at Q2, there was a big drop in oil at that point in time, and also domestic demand for gasoline and somehow driving was not that strong. Maybe it was a little bit of not kind of summery weather, if you will, and that reduced a little bit the miles.","As we've seen, the industry reacted a little bit with taking output out at the end of the second quarter. We entered Q3 with a little bit better equation in terms of inventories and margins popped up a little bit with lower corn prices and higher oil prices. So, we feel better about the margin structure of the Q3.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome, Sandy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on the competing feedstock environment that you talked about impacting your crush margins. I thought that at this point we were supposed to see, I guess, less competition from feed wheat, and I want to know if that's still the issue. And if so, when is that finally going to pass through?","And also on crush margins. If you look at the futures market for crush margins, I guess it looks okay, but I guess I've heard that in local markets it might be quite different. So, to what extent is the futures markets for crush margins an accurate reflection of what's really going on for soy?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Robert. Good morning. So, two-part question. The first part, most of the feed wheat we have basically \u2013 the market has basically consumed over the second \u2013 of the second quarter. So, I would say, going forward, we feel that that situation will improve, so still a competitive environment from a crushing perspective. But I will say probably the worst was in the second quarter and will improve progressively as we go through the year.","Regarding your discussion about board crush margins and cash crush margins and the convergence or how representative our board crush margins at this point in time. Sometimes, when we go into times of either extreme tightness or extreme or excessive of supplies, sometimes we see this dislocation between cash crush and board crush and it could be more pronounced. And eventually, they all converge and I think that yeah, we need to be careful that sometimes don't get the expectations than maybe the board crush presents versus what we see in the market. And that's what you saw in our results, that results for Q2 were a little bit more subdued.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And just in general, if you wrapped it all up, would you look at your guidance today compared to three months ago, I mean, are you more optimistic about the earnings power for this year or you're less optimistic? Is it about the same versus three months ago?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, I would say we maintain our position as we said before. When we entered 2017, Rob, we thought it was a tough year that will present some improvement in certain markets, but we were very confident about our improvements on the things that we were executing. And we continue to be that way. I will say the first half was not particularly kind in some of the markets, even probably ethanol margins were lower than we expected, and yet we were able to post first half results almost 40% higher than last year.","So, it was based on our own plan. And so our expectation for the end of the year have not changed. We have stayed on plan basically in that regard.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone and thanks for squeezing me in. I'm just going to tag on to a question that was asked a little bit earlier, Juan. And the environment improved pretty nicely in July. We saw a nice rally in the \u2013 weather rally in the grain markets in the U.S. and given a lot of that back up again but we did see some improved fundamentals for the U.S. Ag business.","I guess the question that I had, and we know that the competition from South America is going to be pretty brutal, particularly corn, over the next month or two or three, probably your third quarter, so how much of the crop by your judgment in South America, both beans and corn, is yet to be commercialized? And how does that compare maybe to where it was a year ago?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. So, talking about Brazil, so if you think about soy, the farmer probably have sold about two-thirds of it and if we compare to about over 80% a year ago. New crop at the moment probably maybe 8% to 10% versus maybe 15% a year ago. Corn probably about a little bit than half of the crop \u2013 of the all crop commercialized versus maybe 55% a year-ago. So, probably not much of the new crop has been done at this point in time.","I will say we probably see Brazilian farmers or Brazil exporting more of the corn and holding a little bit more of the beans as they go forward. You don't have a big domestic market for corn, so I think that if you're a farmer, you try to position and take in the export opportunities while you can hold a little bit more on soy beans because eventually you still have a crush \u2013 domestic crush and that you can place those volumes later on in the season. So, that's where we see the pattern, probably South America more aggressive in corn exports and maybe the U.S. being able to compete in soybeans a little bit more during the second half.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Tom Simonitsch on behalf of Ann. Could you talk more on your interpretation of last week's court ruling on EPA and the 2016 RVO and what impact do you think this ruling can have on your priorities of business this year?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Well, there's a lot of speculation about this. So, basically, obviously, the Justice Department has said that they would not go back and adjust 2014 and 2015, but they will adjust 2016, which has been lowered to 14.5. So, it means that for 2016, the obligated parties will need to either blend more ethanol or buy more RINs to the effect of maybe 0.5 billion gallons more than they thought.","So, you said you see the bump in ethanol and RINs pricing on that. So, that's all that we can say at this point in time. It seems to be a small positive for that, and it was a vindication of the RFS as a rule of the country, if you will.","Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And the impact on biodiesel specifically?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think it was positive for Biodiesel, I mean. But there are so many things to be resolved over the next month on biodiesel and all the other aspects. So, I think that that's a business that we have many, many scenarios in which positives could come to biodiesel industry in the second half. So we feel optimistic about that.","Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get some more color around your expectations around ethanol exports, U.S. ethanol exports, for the year. Obviously they have been strong. And then just if you can talk about the Brazilian fundamentals. And as we look at kind of the second part of this season for mills down there, and the fact that sugar prices are lower from where were they were at the beginning of the year and last year, granted a little bit of strength here recently. But what expectations are around kind of the conversion of crush down there and to ethanol versus sugar, and how that could impact exports in the second half. As well as if you could talk to the tariff, too. And obviously that's been delayed here for about 30 days, but any insight there would be great.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Brett. So, the exports from the U.S. of ethanol continue to move nicely and grow stronger every year. At this point in time, our team has estimated something between 1.1 billion and 1.3 billion gallons of exports going forward. We see, if we think about 2018, and as you understand, there are many moving parts here and there.","The dynamics in Brazil where they have been trying to favor a little bit in the government the usage of ethanol by having some differentiated piece of things, (49:04) taxes, we think that both governments are trying to be prudent and very mature about their trade relationships. And then both chambers have been discussing things and making sure they don't jeopardize the trade relationships between these two countries. So, we think that the situation in Brazil will normalize soon.","When we think about our expectations for ethanol demand going forward, we see \u2013 if we look at next year, we see potentially an extra 100 million gallons from increased gasoline demand, domestic gasoline demand. We see probably another 100 million gallons out of additional E15 usage. The number of stations offering higher levels of blending continues to increase.","We had about, I don't know, 600 stores dispensing E15 at the end of last year. We're expecting that to grow probably to 1,100 this year and maybe in the range of 2,000 by the end of 2018. So, again, that's a very healthy growth of maybe 100 million gallons of E15 next year.","We think about the potential to Mexico, taking maybe 100 million gallons even if we don't include the big cities. That's something that once we establish the 100 million gallons trade flow that will grow potentially into 200 million or 300 million. And we think that, potentially, we could send 100 million to 200 million gallons to Europe as the market opens back to ethanol.","You still have the potential for China to come back as a buyer. So, even if something will happen to Brazil, we'll still see significant demand coming into the ethanol market, which we think that's going to be not that much capacity expansion. So we think there's going to be a tightening in the margin going forward for the next year. So, we're actually positive about the dynamics of ethanol going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll, Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Well, thank you, and good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Wanted just to go back to \u2013 you made some comments here. But this is, I think, a critical question about what's gone on with board crush margins and how strong they have been \u2013 and it's not just a one-quarter phenomenon; it's been happening for a while \u2013 relative to cash crush margins and how much weaker they have been. Can you really lay out the case here for why there's such a big divergence? And what should we expect going forward? Is the board crush margin a valid indicator to look at, at this point?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah, David, I will try my best to explain this. There isn't one simple answer for this question, as obviously there are a number of factors that weigh in on this such as currencies, logistics, feed alternatives, local\/regional cash market dynamics. So, as I was saying before when I was answering for Eric, during times of extreme tightness or excessive supplies, we have seen sometimes this dislocation between cash crush and board crush, and sometimes can be more pronounced like it's been now. Certainly, one of the larger catalysts this year of lower cash margin have been the high level of global stocks to usage inventories that we've seen around the world. But the way I tend to think about it is the Chicago board price is one price that is made up of thousands of cash markets in North America, South America, Europe and everywhere in the world. And this cash markets use the Chicago price as their proxy, I will say, but just the basis to get to a local cash price that compensates for a local supply and demand dynamics, and that's what we see as operators.","So, understand that the basis is that mechanism that manages regional and local cash markets. You can see why cash and board crush don't always have the same price. This year has been no exception. Each region has its own unique set of market dynamics, I guess. And like South America with slower than normal farmer selling and given the lower board movement and currency fluctuations.","And North America has experienced pressure from feed substitutes, the famous DDGs trade to China that didn't happen. And extremely weak meal basis that Europe has also pressures from the Argentina crop side. So, looking forward, it seems reasonable to believe that the South America soybean meal and oil take a larger role in supplying the world and that the U.S.-driven board crush delivery system will have to adjust for additional factors like currency, ocean freight and more influential region markets.","So, we think that with solid global demand and global stocks usage levels expected to move lower probably over the next year, we think that regional crush capacity utilization levels will improve and hopefully these things will converge. So, a longwinded answer, hopefully it added some clarity, David, to this complex issue.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I appreciate that. If I could just have a follow-up on one of the programs you talked about on the call about ADM1 (sic) [1ADM] (55:04). But I'd just like to hear your impressions as to just the origination margins everywhere have contracted over the last few years. You've often discussed it, but it really feels like it's more notable in recent quarters. What do you think has happened just fundamentally with improved farmer access to weather data or other pricing information? And then really what I'm getting at here is how does all this investment that you're doing right now in the company kind of help ADM regain some of the competitive advantage, this kind of balance of power between the farmers and the grain originators?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes, David. So, let me see if we address the different aspects of your very good question. First of all, that's not a competition between the farmer and ADM. We like to think that we are part of the same value chain and we have very good relationship with farmers around the world.","For ADM to be successful, we need a successful farming community. So, I will never want to pass the impression that we are competing or fighting with the farmer. I think there is a reality, David, is that as we talked before about the basis, the markets are efficient. And when you see places in which products don't have a very good use or very low basis, normally some capacities brought into that to take advantage of the opportunity.","So, that's why you see movement in our footprint sometimes and movement in the farmers as well, or even capacity, whether it's you crush corn or you crush soybean. So, we seen that all the time. Our role is to adjust our company to the new opportunities we're seeing ahead of us. And we see that sometimes those opportunities are for us to go forward into crushing or milling of the product. And you saw the reflection in our investments. Sometimes those opportunities are geographical like the removal of the sugar regime in Europe and the opportunity that present for corn syrups. Sometimes that is even by our customers, how they shift, and we've seen that in, for example, WFSI part in which our traditional CPG customers are having more difficulties to grow revenue, but where we have seen a polarization, if you will, of the consumer in which consumers that are health conscious and maybe millennials or Z-generation are much more looking at natural solutions, that's where our WFSI is so strongly positioned. But we also see people having more conventional food, leaning more towards private labels. So, you see this polarization, if you will, of the consumers. And we see how WFSI is very strong, providing solutions also into the private labels.","So, we continue to see this. And then we adjust sometimes to take advantage of the opportunity, sometimes to neutralize the negative like we've done in destination marketing. Destination marketing sounds very simple, but it's a huge undertaking around the world that takes us to new geographies, that take us closer to customers but take us to 10% volume growth or higher margin products all the time.","So I would say markets are efficient, David, and when there is an opportunity somewhere or a high ROIC somewhere, capacity tends to come to reduce that and that's why competitive advantage don't last that longer and you continue to adjust. So, we are an active team in that sense. We have a very talented people around the world searching for those opportunities.","We do believe that with all the things that we have done and I highlighted here, we established a more robust platform for earning growth. And we do believe that we're going to be able to beat previous levels of earnings growth in the future, and we have calculated that all these will take us to a 10% ROIC as we execute this plan. That's why we've been so consequential about showing you the improvements of that plan every quarter because we think that that's the path to 10%, and we're highly committed to that.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Juan, just a question on \u2013 there's been some chatter out of China that with the excess corn position, they're ramping up high fructose corn syrup production there. I assume that they wouldn't be profitable coming back into the U.S. market, and they're mainly going to look to play in the Asian sugar market. But do you have any sense of the size of their capacity? And are you hearing or seeing anything about it in any of the markets that you play in?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Vince. You know we have a new plant there in China, in Tianjin, of high-fructose corn syrup that we started last year. Our plant is very well located to be both supplying the Chinese market and the export markets. And you probably heard on my remarks that we achieved full utilization of our plant. And this is because, as you describe correctly, the local situation with regards to corn has become more competitive. So, it has allowed us to sell.","I would say some of that capacity that we're running at very low rates is coming back in China, mostly supplying the domestic market. There is still a huge opportunity to grow high-fructose corn syrup domestically. So I will say it barely pencils out of China, it doesn't pencil all the way to North America. So you will see this volume still inside, but supporting the carbonated soft drink growth there in China.","But you are correct. Units have become more competitive there, and they have come to higher rates. I don't recall top of my head, to be honest, Vince, the capacity that they have, but we will get that number to you. I don't want to guess here.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, no worries. Doesn't sound like it's that meaningful. And just as a quick follow-up, have you broken out your CapEx in terms of growth versus maintenance?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. So this year we're going to be around $1 billion in CapEx. For us, maintenance is something between $250 million to $300 million depending on the year and the project, the magnitude of the individual project. So, I will say you take two-thirds of that and it becomes growth and cost. It's not only growth, it's \u2013 we split almost half and half between cost and growth the remainder of the capital.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Thank you, Vince.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Morning, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, Juan, you've repeatedly said that you focus on the actions that you can control. And you don't focus as much \u2013 or you can't focus on the environment all the time, and you do work within that. So with that, my first question really is, if I look at WFSI, that's a business that you should be able to control. And yet that hasn't developed the way you would have thought, and probably underperformed relative to your initial expectations. And then the second part of the question is when you're taking all these actions, and quite honestly, I couldn't write quick enough to find out exactly what you're doing throughout. How does this change your operating profit outlook for 2018 and 2019? Are we looking at a return of X (1:03:24)? Are we looking at an earnings power increase? What are all these actions doing? Or are they just compensating for the structural challenges within the market?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. Okay. Let me address that, Ken. Thank you for the question on WFSI actually. I would like to talk a little bit about both the short term and the long term. In WFSI and as you say, it's more what we can control. First of all, you have to realize the movement in the consumer in the food and beverage industry this year and over the last three years has been spectacular. And it's take all our attention and all our agility to remain on top of that.","So, I think we shouldn't underestimate just because these are not related to commodity market. These are stable markets or markets that don't require a lot of adjustment. So, I'm very proud the way our team had positioned ADM to take, as I said, this polarization of the consumer, if you will, in which you have these natural products being introduced at the same time that we get more traditional products taken into more private label.","So, yeah, there has been a big shift and we've been \u2013 we'd remain on top of that. And that's represented by the WILD Flavors growth rate. If you look at so far this year, we have grown revenue 9%. And that's a very healthy growth rate today compared to anybody in the food and beverage industry. So I think that the business have done terrific in that regard, and we continue to increase our margins in that business, pointing 20% year-over-year increases over the last two years. And I think we are in that rate this year as well.","So I would say WILD Flavors has been very, very good at that. But at the same time that that is happening, we are investing a lot in this business to get the capabilities up to provide the solutions for these customers. So, we open an innovation center in Sydney, that costs money. We open an innovation center in Cranbury that I think you visited this year, but we also expanded recently the culinary aspects of that. We built a plant in \u2013 Fibersol plant in China, and we built this complex in Campo Grande that it took the whole year to bring into operation.","So, all those things are capabilities, are earnings power that we're building that's going to hit the P&L next year. So, we feel good about this, but we've been in the commodity business for 115 years and we've been in the ingredients and flavor business for the last 3 years. So, of course, we need to improve the capabilities and get bigger in that.","We are very happy with WILD Flavors. Some of the products in Specialty Ingredients have suffered. Some of them have been self-inflicted wounds on things that candidly we did not execute well in some of the integrations of the acquisitions and some of them have been market issues. They are \u2013 we are recovering that. I would say half of the businesses that we're having some problems are becoming much better. And we expect SI part of the WFSI to have a much better second half than the first half. So, we continue to be as excited as we were at the beginning of the prospect of that.","And it has the broad growth rate for the company, a growth engine that we certainly didn't have before. When you put everything together, as you describe, I think we continue to make our footprint more resilient to some of these changes, Ken. And we do believe as I mentioned before that this will take us to earnings that will surpass historical earnings.","Will they happen in 2018? Probably not in 2018, probably, but it's within the next two or three years. And we certainly are very convinced about getting back to the 10% ROIC that we set as target when we put together our strategy. I don't know, Ray, if you want to talk a little bit about the...","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Well. In terms of, Ken, I mean, naturally you mentioned there are things that we can control and there's things that we can't control. For the things that we can control, as Juan indicated, some of the actions that we're taking in terms of delayering spans of control. In addition, yesterday we announced that we're going to effectively sunset our U.S. salary DB plan.","So, when you take a look at things that we can control, when I look at 2018, again, we haven't started our 2018 planning process yet. But when you take a look at our run-rate type of savings, right, for 2018, for the things that we can control of the list that \u2013 of what Juan announced, there's probably at least about $100 million of run-rate savings that we will be able to benefit in 2018. And that's going to continue into the future there.","So, again, we do believe \u2013 again, we haven't started our 2018 planning process yet. But, again, for things that we're working on right now, at least of what we have announced, at least $100 million of run-rate savings. And don't forget, in terms of the savings that we're going to generate this year, as Juan indicated, we are well on track to pass our cost reduction targets for this year. I mean, that will also be ongoing savings into the future.","So, again, I think we \u2013 that's the reason why we feel good about the future. We feel good about our path towards getting back past our historical earnings and towards our long-term 10% ROIC target with the actions that we're taking.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","So, Ken, when we think about \u2013 just to clarify also or expand on what Ray said, when you think about our operational excellence savings, let's say, the $225 million that we're expecting this year, those are separate from the $100 million run-rate that we could have in 2018 by some of the delayering and other aspects. So, the operational excellence is more about adding technology to get those cost savings. The other one is more of flexing our organizational design and reducing layers. So, this will be additive in 2018, if you will.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Hi. Good morning.","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","A question all around your Corn Processing segment. Could you share with us how much of the improvement you (1:10:29) is market-driven in both sweeteners and starches? And how much is really driven by ADM's actions to, for example, improve lysine, or improve international, make acquisitions? Can you just kind of break that apart for us a bit?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Let me help you qualitatively while Ray think about the quantitative answer maybe to that question, Farha. Listen, the sweeteners and starches \u2013 first of all, when we talked a lot about our operational excellence and our cost improvements, Farha, as you know, the corn plants are the largest unit plants that we have in the company with the most complex operation sometimes.","So, those are the plants that normally receive or generate the bulk of the improvements, if you will, whether they are yields or energy efficiency or things like that. So, when we talk every year about these $225 million saving things coming to the P&L, a lot \u2013 a big proportion of that comes through the P&L of sweeteners and starches.","So, this is a business that has benefited a lot from being able to run at very high capacity utilizations and very stable rates, if you will, because that have allowed our engineers to fine-tune the operations. And we continue to see a strong demand for not only high-fructose corn syrup to Mexico and others, but also from corn syrup, from dextrose. So, the more stable demand and high utilization levels that we have, the better our engineers can run those operations.","So, I would say the other aspect of this is that we have made this business more international, which helps in many, many ways, not only giving us an extra stream of earnings from Europe, from the Eaststarch operations or from China, but also allows us to give us better information from a technology perspective and market perspective.","So, I would say the team has leveraged all these, and continues to excel year-over-year. And we continue to be very, very confident about the future of the Corn business. So, I don't know, Ray, if you can quantify a little bit what...","Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yeah. I mean I think, Farha, I mean when I take a look at our second quarter results, I mean, clearly our Tianjin operation is improving, so that helps in terms of improving the S&S line. Our European operations are improving, year-over-year improvements there. So, that's a positive in terms of numbers.","Our cost reduction efforts in corn also translate to year-over-year improvement. So, there's a lot of actions that we've taken which have driven the improvements in sweeteners and starches. You mentioned some of the other improvements. Remember, lysine is actually part of the Bioproducts division. And so the \u2013 some of the Bioproducts' improvements are actually related -relate to lysine around that particular alliance.","So, all in all, Farha, again, I don't have the exact numbers but I can assure you that a lot of the improvements in sweeteners and starches are actions that we have taken either to grow the portfolio or actually make our cost even more competitive in our processing plants.","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","I think an important aspect of this, Farha, is also our Corn business as I said before has gone global. That's bringing increased earnings and we're going to increase earnings. We're going to continue to increase earnings in Europe as we take advantage of the sugar change regime. But also we are moving into the central part of that market with Chamtor. And also diversifying feedstocks, because it's a wheat-related one. And we are in the middle of China.","China and Eastern Europe offer spectacular opportunity to increase corn syrup versus sugar. And we are very well positioned to the point that we are already expanding Turkey and Bulgaria. So, we feel very good about our quarter-end results but even more excited about the future for the Corn business.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","So, your international growth opportunities for next year can help grow this business, so you expect earnings growth next year for both sweeteners and starches and bioproducts?","Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.","Yes. I think that when I think about the contribution, for example, Farha, of the Tianjin plant, which is a large plant, the first year is a negative, because you bring a plant and you don't have it filled completely. This year, we announced it's already filled. So next year we're going to have another improvement in profitability in that plant. So, you should count that.","Second is Eaststarch. You're going to have expansions and continued improvements of that. Third, you're going to have a full year of Chamtor next year contributing to that. And don't forget, sweeteners and starches in the U.S. continue to be very tight. And we continue to have more demand for other corn syrups and dextrose.","So I will say our team has positioned the growth prospect of the Corn business very, very right, and we're very excited about the future of that business.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful.

And finally, they will take your questions. Please turn to Slide 3.","I will now turn the call over to Juan.","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning we reported first quarter's adjusted earnings per share of $0.46, down from $0.68 in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $608 million.","It was a more challenging quarter than we initially expected. Severe weather in North America, the ongoing China trade dispute, and a difficult ethanol industry margin environment, all impacted the quarter. As we look ahead; however, we expect improved conditions in the second half of the year and we remain focused on executing our strategy and making changes to improve our company including some new actions we are announcing today. And despite the challenging start of the year, we remain committed to continuing to pull the levers under our control to deliver our objective of full year earnings comparable to or higher than 2018.","We have already made substantial progress in each of the three strategic pillars this year. In our optimize pillar, we've begun the process of rationalizing our peanuts and tree nut selling footprint in the U.S. We announced the closure of two 100-year old wheat flour mills in the Midwest as we approach the second half opening of our new state-of-the-art facility in Mendota, Illinois; and we still plan to close our century old mill in Chicago once the new facility is online. We also sold three grain elevators in Kansas, Colorado, and Oklahoma as part of our continued efforts to optimize our U.S. origination footprint.","In our drive pillar, as part of Readiness, we expanded a company-wide process simplification effort that seeks to improve our business model to realize additional value across the company. We enhanced our global business services organization by centrally pooling accounting, finance, and other support resources that were previously spread throughout the organization. And thanks to Readiness, we are continuing to improve our capital prioritization, as well as our project evaluation and execution processes. We did enhance efficiency and effectiveness resulting from these changes; we are reducing our projected capital spending for 2019 by 10% to a range of $800 million to $900 million.","In our growth pillar, we expanded and streamlined our UK origination footprint with the acquisitions of Gleadell Agriculture and Dunns Limited. We advanced our capabilities to provide innovative, cutting-edge digital tool for farmers by closing and formally launching our GrainBridge joint venture with Cargill. We took steps to position ourselves as a thorough global leader in natural citrus ingredients with the completion of our previously announced acquisition of Florida Chemical Company, and an agreement to acquire a leading European citrus flavor provider, Ziegler Group. We launched Bio-Kult Migrea, an innovative new probiotic formulation from our Protexin business. We celebrated the grand opening of our fourth recently modernized animal nutrition production facility in North America. And of course, we completed our transformative acquisition of Neovia, making us one of the world's leaders in value-added animal nutrition solutions. As we look forward, we are continuing to advance our strategic priorities.","Today, I want to discuss three important new measures to strengthen our company, enhance our results, and drive long-term value creation.","First, ADM plans to repurpose its corn wet mills in Marshall, Minnesota, to produce higher volumes of food and industrial-grade starches, as well as liquid feedstocks for food and industrial uses, phasing out production of high-fructose corn syrup at that facility as soon as we complete our committed deliveries. The market for starches continues to grow in North America. Our team has done a great job meeting this demand, and with this repurposing, we will be positioning ourselves to continue to be a leader in food and industrial starches.","Second, the company is creating an ethanol subsidiary that will report as an independent segment once established. The establishment of the new subsidiary will facilitate the separation of our three ethanol dry mills, as we advance strategic alternatives, which may include, but are not limited to, a potential spin-off of the business to existing ADM shareholders. Of course, as with any strategic decision, this changes to our portfolio will be subject to market conditions, acceptable valuations, and the approval of our board.","Third, earlier this month, we began a serious of new actions to enhance our agility, accelerate growth, and strengthen customer service. One of these actions is a series of organizational changes to help centralize and standardize business activities and processes, enhance productivity and effectiveness, implement new technologies, and eliminate overlap in roles and responsibilities. We are also accelerating our efforts to capture planned synergies after a period of acquisitions. And, of course, our teams continue to identify additional synergy opportunities.","Finally, we have opened a voluntary early retirement window for certain eligible U.S. and Canadian colleagues. These organizational actions are important steps to ensuring that our company is structured to meet the evolving needs of our customers, our business, and our shareholders.","Please turn to Slide 4. All of our work in each of our strategic pillars, as well as the new initiatives we are undertaking are guided and supported by our Readiness efforts, which continue to accelerate and enhance our competitiveness. Last quarter, we reported that we have prioritized 525 Readiness initiatives that will allow us to generate more than $1 billion of run rate benefits by the end of 2020, and contribute $200 million to $250 million to our bottom-line in 2019. Thanks to our team's ongoing efforts, our [indiscernible] has now expanded to 650. And as we continue to execute our initiatives and expand our pipeline, we have increased our estimate of 2019 net benefits to $250 million to $300 million, and our estimate of run rate benefits by the end of 2020 to $1.2 billion.","In addition, by the end of the first quarter, almost 3,400 colleagues have completed our comprehensive Ability to Execute or A2E training, which enables and empowers colleagues to advance the cultural changes we are implementing. I'll talk more about the Readiness at the end of this call.","Now, Ray will take us through our business performance. Ray?","Ray Young","Yes, thanks, Juan. Slide 5 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.46, down from the $0.68 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $608 million, down 15%. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.8%, slightly over 100 basis points above our 2019 annual WACC of 6.75%, a significant improvement from the year-ago period, and generating positive EVA of nearly $300 million. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was approximately 26%, which included transition tax expense from U.S. Tax Reform and other discrete tax items. Excluding those items, the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was about 19%. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 20%, which was our initial guidance.","On Chart 18 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.41 to the adjusted earnings of $0.46 per share. The adjustments include charges of $0.02 per share each related to impairment restructuring and settlement charges, and expenses related to acquisitions, a $0.03 per share charge due to the transition tax expense and discrete tax items, and a $0.02 per share gain on sale of assets.","Slide 6 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Other business results were $14 million, slightly ahead of the prior year period. Our full year estimate of other is about $100 million based upon actual and expected underwriting performance. In the corporate lines, net interest expense for the quarter increased due to higher long-term debt levels, largely due to the Neovia acquisition. We are still on target toward approximately $400 million of net interest expense on a managerial basis for the calendar year. Unallocated corporate costs of $183 million were up versus the prior year, principally due to the centralization of certain activities from the business units, resulting in a transfer in the costs, as well as investments in IT, R&D, and innovation, and Readiness related project costs.","We are still on target toward approximately $700 million for the calendar year. Other charges for the quarter in corporate included improved due to better results from the company's investment in CIP.","Turning to cash flow statement on Slide 7; we generate about $0.5 billion from operations before working capital in the first quarter. Total spending for the quarter was about $200 million, in line with the year-ago quarter. Spending on acquisitions amounted to nearly $1.9 billion, as we closed on the acquisitions of the Neovia, Florida Chemical Company and Gleadell Agriculture. As Juan mentioned earlier, with an enhanced processes in place, we are reducing our projected capital spending for 2019 by 10% to a level of $800 million to $900 million. In the first quarter, we also returned $200 million of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends.","Slide 8 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31, 2019 and 2018. Our balance sheet remains solid and continues to position us very well for 2019. Our operating working capital of $8.2 billion was down approximately $1 billion versus the year-ago period on lower inventory levels. Total debt was about $9.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance of $8.9 billion. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up slightly from the year-ago period, as we funded the Neovia acquisition, which closed on January 31. Our shareholders' equity of $18.9 billion was up slightly from $18.7 billion last year, primarily due to net earnings in excess of dividends, share repurchases and translation adjustments.","We have $6.2 billion in available global credit capacity at the end the quarter. If you add available cash, we had access to $7.1 billion of short-term liquidity. Our average share count for the quarter was 566 million on a fully diluted basis. Relating to the new accounting change for leases that took effect at the start of this quarter, we are recording a right of used assets of close to $800 million, classified in other assets with an offsetting lease liability classified in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Next, I'll discuss our business segment performance for the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 9. In the first quarter, we earned $608 million of adjusted operating profit excluding specified items down 15% from the $717 million in last year's first quarter. Now, I'll review the performance and outlook for each segment.","Starting on Slide 10, origination results were higher than prior year period despite approximately $30 million in impacts from severe weather conditions. Merchandising and handling results were up versus the prior first quarter of 2018, which had been negatively impacted by significant mark-to-mark timing effects. The team executed well and drove solid margins for North American exports of both soybeans and corn. In addition, a strong performance in structured trade finance and the reversal of some timing impacts from the fourth quarter, helped to offset a softer performance in global trade which was impacted by normalized South American soybean and soybean meal margins versus the first quarter of last year. Results in the quarter were also held back by high water river conditions which limited grain movement and sales in North America. The transportation team did a great job to deliver higher year-over-year results as improved freight rates in northbound movements offset lower overall barge volumes caused by unfavorable river conditions.","Looking ahead, we expect origination second quarter results to be significantly lower than the very high second quarter of 2018 and similar to the first quarter of this year. In 2018, North American exports were abnormally high in anticipation of a trade shutdown with China. Absent those conditions this year, North American volumes and margins will be substantially lower in the second quarter. In addition, high water will continue to impact our coal operations. Further out, we see a significant ramp up for origination in the second half of the year. The business will benefit from the expected resolution of the US-China trade situation particularly if China imports U.S. corn in addition to soybeans as river conditions normalize, our coal will have opportunities to capitalize on backlogs from the first half weather slowdowns.","Now to Slide 11; oilseeds results were comparable to the year-ago period. Crushing and origination was up significantly versus the first quarter of 2018, which included substantial negative timing effects. Higher executed crush margins and a record first quarter volumes globally helped drive the strong performance. The reversal of timing impacts from the previous quarter had a positive effect of about $75 million and there is an additional $75 million still to reverse in the coming quarters. Slow farmer selling and lower China demand negatively impacted South American origination results. In the first quarter last year, the retroactive application of the 2017 biodiesel tax credits added about $120 million to refining, packaging biodiesel and other results. If we were to exclude that one-time impact, our first quarter 2019 results for RPBO were higher year-over-year.","Increased contributions from food oils in North America and Europe, including our Olenex joint venture helped contribute. Asia was lower on Wilmar results which included some sugar impairment charges. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2019, last year the drought in Argentina helped to bolster global crush margins. In the second quarter without these impacts, we expect second quarter results to be about 20% down from the exceptionally high second quarter last year. Beyond the second quarter, a strong forward sales book points to a solid near-term, in addition, much as the drought in Argentina impacted soybean meal margins last year, the growing impact of African swine fever points toward greater demand for soybean meal outside of China in the back half of this year and likely beyond.","Slide 12, please. Carbohydrates Solutions results were substantially lower than the year ago quarter. The severe weather in North America during the quarter significantly affected results in both starches and sweeteners and bioproducts by reducing production volumes, increasing manufacturing and logistics costs and causing onetime remediation expenses. The most significant impacts were at our corn wet and dry mills in Columbus, Nebraska, though the Decatur complex was also impacted due to slowdowns in corn deliveries. In total, the weather impacts for the quarter reduced results by close to $30 million.","Starches and sweeteners was down versus the first quarter of 2018. In Europe, low sugar prices due to wheat oversupply along with higher wheat prices and the domestic starch-based sweetener quarter decreased in Turkey are pressuring industry volumes and margins. The severe weather in North America, higher manufacturing costs at the Decatur complex, and weaker margins in flour milling also drove the weaker results. Bioproducts results were negative and much lower than the prior year period. Ethanol margins were down significantly versus last year's first quarter in a continued weak industry environment and risk management opportunities were limited. Volumes and margins were also affected by the severe weather.","Looking ahead, residual impacts of the severe weather will affect Carbohydrates Solutions results in the range of $10 million to $20 million in the second quarter. If those effects were excluded, we would expect second quarter performance to be similar to or slightly below the second quarter of 2018. Despite the soft start to the year, we expect a stronger back half for Carbohydrates Solutions as our improvements in the Decatur complex deliver enhanced reliability, ethanol margins seasonally improve and the resolution of US-China trade dispute may offer the opportunity of ethanol exports and further margin enhancement.","On Slide 13, nutrition results were overall down year-over-year with WFSI higher and animal nutrition lower. WFSI results were higher year-over-year with 21% profit growth spread across all three businesses and WILD Flavors in particular turning in another very strong performance. Year-over-year sales increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Organic sales, excluding new acquisitions were up 6%. An improved product mix and new customer wins, such as plant based proteins utilized as an alternate to meat products, new food service offerings, leveraging our systems approach and innovative dairy beverages containing our probiotic and extract offerings helped drive positive results.","Animal nutrition results were lower than the first quarter of 2018. Last year's quarter benefited from a strong inventory position during a temporary industry shortage of Vitamins A and E, whereas premix margins this quarter reflected normalized vitamin costs. Additionally, Neovia closed on January 31 and purchase price adjustments result in an incremental $10 million of inventory cost that flow through our results for the quarter. Lysine production and yields continue to improve from the third quarter 2018 production disruptions, but not yet at normalized levels.","Looking ahead, Nutrition's performance in the second quarter will benefit from the increased contributions of acquisitions, including Neovia, as well as continued sales growth and margin improvements in WFSI. Lysine continues to recover, and this is expected to continue throughout the second quarter as a result profits for Nutrition for the quarter should be approximately 10% higher than the second quarter of last year. The second half of the year should be very strong with continued growth in WFSI and increased contributions from Neovia as we ramp up our global animal nutrition platform and drive synergies.","In summary, for the entire business, while the second quarter results will have a tough comparison with last year's exceptionally strong second quarter, they will be better than our first quarter of this year, and are setting us up well for improvements in the back half of the year which Juan will now discuss. Juan?","Juan Luciano","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 14. The first quarter was challenging, and as Ray explained, we believe some of those challenges will continue into the second quarter. But despite those challenges, we remain committed to executing our plan to deliver our objective of full year earnings compatible to or higher than 2018, and we are making good progress on the growth algorithm we described on our last call.","First, our efforts to improve the performance of certain businesses are continuing to take root. Focus areas like our Decatur complex, lysine, or our golden peanut and tree nuts business are doing better with every passing month, and are on track to be solid contributors in the back half of the year. And we continue to look for additional opportunities such as the Marshall plant repurposing and the ethanol subsidiary, I mentioned earlier.","Second, as I've already discussed, Readiness continues to expand. Readiness is truly changing how we run our business in fundamental ways. Let me give you just one example. The nature of our business is that there are many touching points throughout the value chain. We are now analyzing those to see how can we reduce internal transactions, which in certain businesses are as high as 50% of all transactions. Readiness by streamlining and simplifying our processes is helping us address issues like this, so we can minimize errors, increase efficiencies, and reduce costs. Our colleagues are all in on Readiness, and their support and execution are the reason we are revising our estimates higher including our new $1.2 billion in run rate benefits by the end of next year.","Third, we continue to aggressively harvest the investments we have recently made. As I mentioned earlier, we're accelerating our efforts to capture synergies from recent acquisitions, and we're particularly excited about the addition of Neovia. After three months of ownership, we are tremendously encouraged by the people, the portfolio, and the business, and watch its combination with our existing animal nutrition business offers, a true global leadership position in an important and growing market. We are confident that our initial assumptions on cost, revenue and margin of synergies will be realized, and in fact will likely both accelerate the rate of and increase the size of those synergies.","Our new Readiness based improvements are helping us with growth as well by allowing us to better evaluate and delivered on opportunities, and by improving processes that are allowing us to grow more efficiently, and with less capital spending, as I mentioned earlier. In each of these areas, across the company, we're pulling the levers under our control, which we expect to help contribute to a stronger second half. In addition, we expect some changes in outside conditions, particularly relating to China. While there can be a complete certainty, we see encouraging signs regarding resolution of the US-China trade dispute and we are optimistic for a resolution by mid-year, importantly, well before the U.S. harvest. Our team has shown great agility and flexibility to minimize the impact of the dispute to ADM thus far. Nevertheless, a resolution will benefit several of our businesses.","Our North American origination business will benefit from increased export volumes and margins, particularly on U.S. soybeans, and now potentially corn and other agricultural products. And our Carbohydrates Solutions business will be boosted by the resumption of ethanol trade flows, as China moves toward national implementation of E10. China is also managing through a very serious issue with African swine fever or ASF. Estimates vary, but it's possible that China's hog herd has dropped 20% to 30%. China will clearly need to import substantial amounts of pork and likely other meat and poultry to satisfy demand. This could boost soybean meal demand in regions where our oilseeds business has a strong presence, particularly in North America, Brazil, and Europe.","Finally, of course, some of the transitory impact of the first half, such as the effects of severe weather should be fully behind us in the second half of the year. And so as we look forward to the balance of 2019, we see a strong finish after a challenging start.","With that, Michelle, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Heather Jones from Vertical Group.","Heather Jones","So I have a question about your comments on ASF. So it's been our thought that you would see accelerating protein production in these other origin countries to fulfill the shortfall in China. But thought that would be more like second half. Are you -- your comments sounded more constructive than they did on your Q4 call? So are you already starting to see that expanded demand, ex-China, and as a corollary to that, how are you thinking about the margin structure of that increased demand if there is a trade deal resolution given Chinese demand of U.S. beans will probably accelerate? Thank you.","Juan Luciano","Listen, of course we saw the ASF impacts when we were thinking about the plan for this year, but I think that the world, all of us are rapidly waking up to the significance and the magnitude of this event. I think that at this point in time, we'll see available global protein supplies to have to be redirected to China to satisfy the protein that facilities have created. To give an idea of the magnitude of these, we think that of the probably 700 million herds of annual hog production in China, we may see about 20% to 30% of that disappear. That's about the size of the U.S. production. So this will create the gap in China of about, people take 10 million tons of protein, that is a lot, and I think that that's going to be a pressure on a system that is already working with good demand.","If we look at our business in North America, we are enjoying good demand, and that's why you're seeing margins have stayed very strong, actually margins have popped up over the last couple of days with the drop in soybeans. So I think that overall, we are seeing that how China covers that gap of 10 million tons, maybe 4 million tons, they shift to other proteins, whether it's poultry and all that. But I think that leaves still a significant gap. So imports will have to cover that accelerating weight gain from the existing herd will happen to that, and I think that the countries or the regions more likely to be able to serve that, whether it's Europe or North America or Brazil, are starting to prepare to do that. I cannot say that today we have seen a significant spike in our demand, but we see our customers are getting ready to do that.","So if you think that we are already above $1 per bushel crush margins in the US, if you add this incremental demand, we think that that's very constructive for margins in the second half of the year.","Heather Jones","And you believe that demand can offset potential price increases in beans?","Juan Luciano","We think so. When we think about the scenario for the second half of the year, we think that in a scenario of trade resolution is more bullish for grains, for ethanol, and for pork meat, than actually for soybeans. First of all, because China naturally will have to import less soybeans, we're thinking about before maybe 96 million tons, now we're thinking more like 85 million tons, just because they will have less animals to feed. So, and there are plenty of beans around the world. So we do believe that is going to be more bullish on grains, pork meat and ethanol, than actually in soybeans.","So we believe that given the ownership that we have, any psychological spike in soybean bases will be temporary and we can handle that with our inventory.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi.","David Driscoll","I just wanted one follow-up on your comments on Readiness, and then I have an ethanol question. So, just on Readiness, the program hasn't been out for very long and you're upgrading the program. Can you guys just walk me through your planning process and just why you're so confident that you should be upgrading the program right now. Juan, I know, you mentioned that the project list has gotten larger, but it's just we don't often see a program upgrade so soon after kind of the initial launch of it. And then on ethanol, I wanted to ask you guys about just industry conditions, the loss in the first quarter was quite significant relative to the history at ADM's ethanol operations. Why do you think the industry hasn't been more disciplined, ADM's plants are very large, they're very efficient plants, how did these small ethanol plants fair in the first quarter, I mean, did they just get absolutely hammered if you guys are taking up to $75 million hit.","And then in the second quarter, do you see better discipline industry wide in ethanol? Thank you.","Juan Luciano","Let me address the Readiness question, then may have Ray address the ethanol question. So Readiness actually in April has turned 1-year-old as an initiative. So, we've been working at this for a while, although the first part was the planning process, so it was quiet there if you will and the training. So, at this point in time, we have gotten everybody trained, we have gotten a very robust pipeline of initiatives, and we are going and reviewing every aspect of ADM businesses and this is a very thorough process where we have a pipeline of ideas that are reviewed weekly and weekly are reported into our steering committee and we continue to monitor these. We have seen already two quarters of these, David, don't forget that we implemented this in Q4 2018, which was a little bit ahead of our plan and now we have Q1 behind us. So as we look at our pipeline and the growth of the initiatives, we have some experience into this program, so how much maybe you realize only a percentage of everything you have but every indication so far is we are going ahead of that.","We don't see the drop that sometimes we get when we turn an opportunity from an idea to a reality and we are seeing our teams coming with more ideas to a higher rate than we thought. So, we thought it was in the spirit of transparency was proper to actually disclose that to shareholders increasing our targets. So, of course, we feel extremely confident about that, for us to have increased the target. But, again, don't think that this is just something that is happening overnight. As I said, Readiness has been with us for the year, we have been -- we have trained already 3,400 people in this, we have 650 initiatives and we have two quarters already of realizations of the savings that give us the confidence to increase the targets.","So with that, I will ask Ray to make some comments on the ethanol quarter.","Ray Young","Yes, Ethanol in the first quarter was a tough quarter. Industry conditions were very, very poor. Inventories were building up through the quarter. When you look at generic indices, clearly industry had negative EBITDAs in the first quarter. In fact, when you compare the EBITDAs for the industry first quarter this year versus first quarter last year, we're actually down about $0.25 a gallon. Now, as we kind of look forward, what we're thinking is and you're starting to see this, ethanol margins are improving right now. I think for several factors. First of all, seasonally you always see some improvements in terms of ethanol margins as demand for ethanol improves just due to normally the seasonal pattern of demand here in United States. And secondly, inventory levels, partly due to the weather impacts throughout the entire industry have stabilized. Now going forward, we believe that our resolution of the US-China trade dispute would be a positive catalyst for industry margins.","And, again, David, as you're probably aware, a resolution of US-China trade issue will likely include ethanol as one the commodities that China will purchase and as we indicated, I mean, China is moving toward an E10 program in 2020, a national program, which will basically drive an additional requirement of about 5 billion gallons of ethanol for that country. Their current production capacity is roughly 1 billion gallons domestically and they'll probably have some additional capacity come online, which would quite bring that number up to 2 billion gallons. And so they will probably have about 3 billion gallons deficit in terms of ethanol, which they will have to either source from additional capacity within the country or more likely importing ethanol from other countries such as United States and Brazil.","So, as we kind of think forward in the back half of the year, we do believe that as part of the trade resolution that China will resume imports of ethanol. That will be a positive catalyst for industry margins in the back half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Simon [ph] from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","So you're assuming a resolution on US-China trade before the U.S. harvest. Can you just elaborate on what that resolution looks like beyond ethanol? And then can you discuss the potential impact on each of your businesses later in 2019 without a resolution?","Juan Luciano","We're seeing, of course, we don't have any previous data other than we would revisit reading the tea leaves But if you look at both countries talking about constructive talks and both Presidents giving indications whether in speeches like Presidency or the comments by President Trump, I think both teams are getting closer. Also, if we look at the market and our commercial -- the behavior of our commercial counterparties in China seems to indicate the deal is getting closer whether it is having not being covered for the Q4 and remaining open there or reducing mill inventories in anticipation of having to buy some beans or reviewing the corn contract languages with us, we've seen that they are getting ready for that movement. So what that movement will do, we think that they're going to be, if China, let's say, is going to import about 85 million tons of soybean. We think that maybe the percentage of soybeans they are going to buy from the U.S. could be about 50%, so about 40 million tons.","Then, if you think about that they're going to buy corn and potentially with, that will create for Q4 basically what the conditions that we need in the U.S. for elevation margins to pulp, which is to have a strong simultaneous, if you will, soybean and corn program than we have seen that in other years and that candidly, Tom, is what we plan for. Our plan for 2019 was very second half loaded. We are second-half loaded based on the Q4 potentially strong origination nation earnings and what Ray described before, which is China coming back to us for ethanol into the US, are they trying to fulfill their E10 for 2020 pledge. So we think that those are the two things that will impact. When you add that to the improvements that we're making in our business, whether it's Decatur, or whether it is lysine or whether it is golden peanuts and tree nuts, which will remove some of the burden that was in the second half of last year and we will remove from '19, you will have a better comparable of some of the costs that we faced last year, that we are facing still today, and we're working out of those.","So, all that give us a very constructive perspective for second half. If you add that potentially, the increase in milk consumption in the U.S. or Europe or South America to satisfy the protein gap in China created by the ASF that will give us the confidence to describe second half as being a very, very strong second half that will position 2019 as a very solid year for ADM.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much. And just -- if you could update us on your business turnaround for the year, has the targeted $150 million to $200 million improvement been impaired by weather?","Juan Luciano","No, Tom. I think that the three pillars that we have, the improve pillar and the Readiness and the harvesting; they are all on track or slightly ahead of schedule as we look at after the first quarter. Certainly weather of the severity that we faced in the U.S. doesn't help. We run fermentation units and when you run the fermentation units with an outside temperature of minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit like it happened in January, strange things happen in the plant, but I would say, we still have part of that tail in the first quarter and we might have a little bit of that in Q2, but we expect all these issues to be behind us by the end of Q2, by the end of June. So, I would say we continue to make progress, of course better weather helps, but we have to do what we have done in the first quarter. I think the teams continue to make progress, and we feel these programs are on track, and we will deliver what we promised.","Ray Young","How you want to think about this Tom is some of the weather impacts that we experienced in the first quarter, and maybe some in the second quarter, will get offset with the incremental Readiness benefits that we're going to see particularly in the back half of year. That's how you should be thinking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Anderson from Stifel.","Vincent Anderson","So, just going back to China's 2020 ethanol mandate, I believe they have a significant amount of idled food grade alcohol capacity that could be used to close that capacity gap. Do you have a view on how much of that is actually fit to be converted to fuel grade ethanol, and how long that might take?","Ray Young","Yes. It's tough to assess that. We just think that the gap is so significant that they clearly will need to import now. Do we believe they are going to import 3 billion gallons, I mean, probably not. I mean that seems like a very tall order in 2020, but do we believe this will phase in over time? The answer is 'yes.' And do we believe this will have an impact on the U.S. ethanol margins? Without doubt, it will.","Vincent Anderson","And with regard to your wet mill conversion, was this in response to declining demand for high fructose corn syrup, maybe from a specific customer moving away from the product or is this just more of a portfolio optimization? And then just quickly, what would the timing and earnings impact of that conversion be?","Juan Luciano","Yes, Vincent, this is -- you always heard us talking about the fight for the grind and trying to maximize the margins from the 22 products we tend to make in these places. So, of all the products, starches have been growing very fast, and also the bio economy is placing a lot of requests for fermentation capacity to produce liquid feedstocks to make products for the bio economy. So those are areas that we see with high growth rates and higher margins and candidly, and we said -- we reported this in previous earnings calls, although we've seen 55 hanging better in terms of volume, we saw 42 being replaced more aggressively. So this is a strategic shift in which we are shifting our 42 capacity into things that are going to give us better margin, some better growth rates. So, we are sacrificing a lot, a little bit of volume and share for margins and growth rates, and so we think that this is the right thing to do.","Regarding the specific impact, this will be a transition, Vince, and at this point in time, since we still need to own out a lot of commitments, you wouldn't see any of these in 2019, let's put it this way, it will be more a 2020, 2021 impact if you will.","Vincent Anderson","And just a clarification, this is 42 capacity that you're phasing out?","Juan Luciano","Correct, 42 capacity, yes. This is about 30% of our 42 capacity that we are shedding.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","So I just wanted to go back to the kind of way you've laid out the rest of the earnings for the rest of the year and having flat operating for the whole year. Just with 1Q down as it is, 2Q, I mean against a very difficult comparison, it implies a record back half, and certainly a trade, the trade deal, and the benefit that that could have around origination, around ethanol, and even parts of oilseed processing, certainly auger for better cyclical dynamics. I'm just trying to understand kind of the internal dynamics and internal improvements, I think levers under your control on a year-on-year basis, that help us get to that outlook as we kind of roll through the year?","Juan Luciano","So, again our plan for 2019 is based on three big things. Delivering and sometimes outperforming in the three strategic levers; improve, Readiness and harvest; the trade deal resolution; and the third one, the big impact from ASF. So let me expand on those three a little bit. When we plan the year, we plan a year backend loaded, as I said, this is something that, it was very different seasonality that 2018 for reasons that Ray explained before, Q1 in 2018 had a big vitamin boost because somebody blew up a plant and prices went up. Second quarter with the threat of Chinese tariff in July 1, we got a big boost of export that were anticipated, so a very unusual first half.","On the second half of 2018, we had a lot of these issues with the plants, lysine or golden peanut that made second half lighter. So last year, very different than this year, because this year, we are walking through the tail of those issues in the first half, but we are having them, while we are not going to have them in the second half. While on the other hand, the reaction to the trade deal, it's exactly the opposite, in which there is very little activity in the first half, and we expect it to be much bigger activity in the second half. Probably the two things that we didn't plan, so that, I'm describing the plan, the two things that we didn't plan, because we couldn't know about that, it was one, the severity of the weather in the first half and that is $60 million in the first quarter, and some of that will overspill into the second quarter, maybe like Ray said before, you could consider that the over achievement in Readiness will offset some of that, maybe we get some of that back from insurance, a little bit in the second half, but Readiness like every program that is building is also going to be back-end loaded, if you will.","The other thing that we didn't consider and is a boost to our original plan is ASF, the impact of ASF. As I described before, I think we are just waking up to the significance of that, and we didn't consider at the beginning when we planned for this that this could take 20%, 30% of the herd in China, that this could take 10 million tons of protein at least capacity out, and that's a very big number to fill, and this is going to be filled by an accelerating fattening of hogs if you will in the places where those are. But even with that, the ability to supply is going to be limited. And I think there is going to be short-term volatility because there is going to be shift of people preferences, because China will have with price to incentivize all the pork production to actually go to China. So you're going to have increased protein prices, increased feeding and increased volatility.","So to a certain degree, when we look at 2019, the risks have gone from macro risk, whether there was economic slowdown or a China trade war, more to micro risks that are ASF driven for example, and micro risks, ADM can handle well, we can do things around that, we can do things around our operations, our flexibility, our teams, leverage our footprint, whereas there are less things we can do about macro risks. So, overall, I think that not only we are improving, but I think conditions have shifted to favor more ADM, but it's going to be a back-end loaded, it was a back-end loaded plan, and the weather has made it even more back-end loaded. So I agree with you, it's a tall order, maybe after first quarter the probability of we achieving that became a little bit more difficult, but the plan is still there, and we are working heavily moving every aspect under our control to continue to deliver. So that continues to be the plan.","Adam Samuelson","And then, just on the U.S. export opportunity, just interested in your sizing the grain opportunities to China in the event of a favorable resolution in corn, wheat, DDGs even and just relative to soy, I mean, I would be more inclined to think that those will be more incremental to U.S. balances where the soy market in some respects is pricing in a meaningful return of exports to China already?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I think you saw it even in the market yesterday when Xi Jinping spoke at the Belt and Road Forum or positively about some of the changes that they need to make, which are aligned to that trade resolution or whether Mr. Trump announced that he's inviting Mr. Xi, President, to the White House soon. You saw what the market did, the market basically went down in soybeans, and up in wheat and corn, and up in pork. And I think that's giving you the perspective that, -- and don't forget that for us to tighten up our margins in the US, we probably need 10 million, 15 million tons give or take of corn exports from the U.S. to China. Remember that China used to have -- I mean, they consume like 230 million tons of corn with consumption that is growing faster than their capacity to produce that corn. They used to have like 250 million tons of reserve; today their reserves are something in the range of 75 million to 80 million tons.","So for them as a gesture of complying with the trade resolution to import 10 million to 15 million tons is something very achievable. So we believe that's a very plausible scenario and again we can only read the tea leaves like you are reading, but we think that from the commercial actors all the way to the government, everybody is inching into a deal for the summer and that's what we believe is going to happen.","Ray Young","On corn imports, don't forget, as I indicated earlier, China is ramping up production of ethanol in the country, so they will also need to consume more corn with the domestic ethanol plants that they have in the country. So that's another reason as to why there is an incentive associated with the deal for China to also import U.S. corn.","Adam Samuelson","And then, just a quick clarification on the commentary around the second quarter; the 20% decline quarter-on-quarter in oilseeds, was that the whole segment or was that just crushing and origination?","Ray Young","That's the whole segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Just some follow-ups on the ethanol situation. Did China -- first of all, are they in a position right now where they could go to that E10 blend, is all the infrastructure in place, I mean, I just remember from when the U.S. did it, it wound up taking a long time. So where do you think they are on that? Just to start off.","Ray Young","Well, they currently have in about 10 provinces in the country. They've indicated that they want to move toward the 2020 mandate nationally. They are in the process of moving toward that. Now, will they actually get their nationally by 2020? One can argue they won't get there by that year, but they are clearly on track as part of their environmental focus, remember this is driven by the focus on the environment here, they're moving toward that mandate over time. And so, I think, as I indicated earlier, are they going to import 3 billion gallons in 2020. I don't think they're going to do that, but it is unrealistic to assume that they will import 1 billion gallon from United States in 2020 as part of a trade deal, that's not an unrealistic scenario for us to think about.","Vincent Andrews","And you kind of laid out a pretty good structural bull case for ethanol based on China and so forth. So what is driving sort of the desire to separate the assets, potentially sell it in spin, if it sounds like your outlook is actually quite bullish?","Ray Young","Yes, I think just -- I mean it is a strategic decision on the part of the company. I mean, we do believe that from a medium term perspective, the outlook for the U.S. ethanol industry is constructive but when you think about like what we've announced in the past and we indicated that the dry mills themselves, right. There is an industry structure issue here in United States, which I think they alluded to at an earlier call, is that there is a lot of producers of ethanol and so there is a case for consolidation in the industry here. And so from our perspective, our decision to monetize the dry mills is, frankly, a strategic decision on our part to basically help the industry consolidate and we're still going to have wet mills here, right. And so, we still have some wet mill capacity available, but from a business strategy perspective, we believe this is in the best interest of our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Just a question about the oilseeds outlook for second quarter being down 20%, I think your commentary about first quarter was that really strong global demand, margin is good and so to see the guidance be pretty, pretty negative for 2Q, even after you stripped out the Argentina tough comp, is there something else that's making the comparison tough versus year ago that I'm forgetting? Thanks.","Ray Young","Don't forget Rob, last year in the second quarter crush margins were extremely healthy, right, driven primarily not just because of the China issue, but really the Argentina drill situation, it really culminated in the second quarter when we saw margins move toward $2 per bushel. So when we look at this year and we compare this year versus last year, you're not going to see that pop right in terms of the underlying margin structure. At the same time, demand remains very strong, right. From our perspective, the environment remains very constructive for demand for particularly U.S. soybean meal. So, therefore, we believe the margin environment is going to be healthy for us in the second quarter. It's just not going to be as health -- as strong as what we saw last year in the second quarter which was frankly abnormally strong like $2 per bushel, margins were abnormally strong.","Juan Luciano","Yes, I think this is the quarter, Rob, where we have to absorb all the harvest that's coming from Argentina and all that, they are going place that capacity. The world needs Argentina mills and, I think, as Ray described, last year was an anomaly in that regard. So this is a more normalization on that in a still very strong environment from a demand and margin perspective.","Robert Moskow","So you -- for the year for oilseeds, has anything changed versus your outlook for the overall year?","Juan Luciano","I think today versus our previous call, we are more optimistic than last time. Remember that so far this year, we also don't have the benefit that we had last year of the Biodiesel tax credit that we believe that is going to come during the second half, but I would say given my comments before about ASF, our scenario for oilseeds has become more constructive since our last call, we see now even higher meal growth around the world outside China than we saw at our last call, so significantly higher.","Robert Moskow","Yes, and that's despite the fact that South America, I think the commentary for the quarter anyway was slow farmer selling, weak origination margins, so does that mean that your confidence is very North America oriented regarding oilseeds being better?","Juan Luciano","In South America, there are, of course, we do not have crushing in Argentina, but in Brazil, we are not pessimistic about it I would say, think about these Biodiesel continues good in Brazil, also refined oils is going very strong and the fact that Brazil has very big -- very large corn crop will be positive for crushing in the second half because to a certain degree now corn is taking a lot of the infrastructure, so people will have less of a pressure to chase beans to comply with their mark to market -- sorry not mark to market -- with their take-or-pay contracts. So, corn taking part of that alleviates that, will create a better environment or less pressure on soybean basis later on that will benefit crush.","So I think that even for Brazil, we are more optimistic and remember that we will have the impact of the Algar -- positive impact of having Algar in our portfolio that we didn't have in the second half of last year. So, all that makes the second half very positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken","Just a couple of other follow-up questions on oilseed. In terms of your stake in Wilmar, how are they going to be affected by ASF and have you sort of incorporated any sort of potential headwind there?","Juan Luciano","Listen, if you think about Wilmar, I know what I'm going to describe is public information. So, but if you think about, of course, short-term they are going to impact I think in crush and, first of all, always remember the Wilmar team is exceptional at risk management adjusting. So they are very, very astute and very good at that. So we feel that if somebody -- if there is a team that can navigate that, it is the ADM team or the Wilmar team. So they are very good at that. But second, if you think about their earnings and sometimes it's not that clear, but if you look at public information about half of their earnings is the segment that they describe as oilseeds and grains, that includes their oilseed crushing, but also include wheat milling, Wilmar is a giant wheat miller in China and also includes their consumer products. So, let's say that maybe oilseed is about 25% to 30% of overall earnings for Wilmar. Then you have a big segment which is palm oil which is about 35% of that, and Wilmar is the largest palm oil producer in the world. And then you have about 15% to 17% of other associates which are joint ventures in either Africa or Russia. So, I would say -- and then you have the sugar business. So when you think about it, it's a very, very diversified and well-balanced portfolio.","So even if crush margins in the short-term may have an issue, you still have palm oil, you still have consumer products, you still have wheat milling, you still have the affiliates and you still have sugar. So, and again, I can't disclose any specifics, but I would say between their ability to risk manage and their wide and diversified portfolio, we think they're going to be all right.","On the long-term, actually, we believe that ASF would probably be a positive, ASF is having this effect of to a certain degree consolidating the industry, the pork producing industry in China, the more acute crisis is in the small farms, sometimes these small farmers are not feeding properly their pork's, sometimes they feed leftover so whatever. While I think the bigger, larger companies, they are more professional feeders. So we think that to a certain degree, this crisis will weed out some of the small farmers and consolidate the industry, that consolidation will do two things. First of all, for -- bio sanitary reasons, there's going to be a delay in rebuilding the herd, just because of you're going to have to have less density in order to have some of these bio sanitary measures applied, that will make that this scenario that we are describing, we think is going to be with us for the next three years.","The second effect on that is that again, the industry will consolidate in larger players that will be more users of soybean meal than other products. So I think that over time this will make a healthier environment for Wilmar's customers. So, short-term choppy, long-term positive.","Michael Piken","And then, could you talk about the situation down in Brazil with logistics. I know last year there was a big truckers' strike, what's happening down there, and as we approach harvest, are you expecting any hiccups to your Brazilian operation?","Juan Luciano","So at this point in time when the harvest comes, obviously the truckers' is when they put forward their mandates. The situation in Brazil, if I can describe it is complex in the sense that Petrobras is aligning their diesel prices to international markets, what they call the international parity pricing, and of course, the soy change and the meal change works at market prices. So, it's very difficult how do you regulate freight and expect it to work because you cannot guarantee freight for a piece of the chain when the two other aspects of the chain are working on market pricing. But certainly, the situation for the truck owners is complicated, and I can understand them, because at this point in time, there is low economic activity in Brazil, there is a little bit of a recession going on; so there are low freight prices. In an environment in which Petrobras was to increase oil prices because of oil prices climbing, and there is overcapacity of trucks, given the past subsidies to buy trucks.","So when you add that, the poor state of some of the roads in Brazil, that maybe create more maintenance cost for the truckers. The truckers are a little bit in bind. So, this could become and more -- a bigger issue. The government has been trying to discuss and negotiate and have a dialog with truckers, and of course we have this issue of the freight table. The freight table, the end has not been heard about the freight table, the freight table if the government ask the School of Agriculture of the University of Sao Paulo to create a technical freight table, then new technical freight table is like a 45% under the current negotiated freight prices that there are in Brazil right now. So, the problem we're going to have with that, there are 60-days of public hearings right now to discuss that that is supposed to be implemented in July. So theoretically, you're going to have two freight tables, one in July, one in January every year. But of course, although, we feel good with the freight table that this 45% under current negotiated market prices, that, as you can imagine, the truck drivers will not be happy with that.","So I think that we are following it very closely, and it continues to emphasize the issues that Brazil has in terms of infrastructure that makes the U.S. a more reliable supplier sometimes. So, Brazil big producer continues to be unreliable from a logistics perspective if you will. So, we're watching it, we're all over it. And at this point in time, we hope that the government and the truckers will find a solution.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow","Just can you talk about the animal nutrition business, and what kind to had gone wrong in there relative to your initial expectations?","Juan Luciano","Yes, I can talk about the animal nutrition. So, we are very happy with the Neovia acquisition. We are very happy how it matches with our business. Our business was mostly North America and China, and the Neovia acquisition brought us Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Europe and Southeast Asia. So very good complement, and the more we own them, the happier we get, and the more optimistic we get about their synergies, and their ability to deliver in 2019. What had happened in the first quarter, first of all, it was a very big comp versus last year because of an issue that the industry had in vitamins that allowed everybody to sell a lot at a very high prices. So, we knew we were not going to have that. And every time you get a new transaction of the size of Neovia, you have this purchase price adjustment, this time was inventory valuation that impacted the quarter in $10 million.","And then, remember, we are fighting still the tail of the lysine issue, the lysine issue is being solved, is being addressed, and we're very happy with the progress, but it still hit us in $10 million. So if you think about $20 million of noise, if you will, with a tough comp, and when you take over a company like in the case of nutrition, and Neovia, you have extra costs that you cannot properly quantify. For starters, people travel more, because you need to get to know each other, we need to start defining the synergies. Remember also that we closed at the end of January, so we closed one less -- we had one month less of that. But as we look today, we are very optimistic and very confident about delivering the EUR100 million of EBITDA that the business was supposed to deliver in 2019. And when we look at the synergies, the synergies that we were looking to deliver, the EUR50 million synergies that we were looking to deliver at year four, we are thinking now, we're estimating, we're going to deliver by the end of the year two. So, much better than expected.","So, I would say, short-term noise, I look at this, can -- a little bit -- traced the parallel what happened with WILD. We took WILD in October 2014. The first quarter, not spectacular, even you guys were complaining, where do you see the revenue growth because we were shifting product mix and all that. Look at -- immediately, we started to grow faster than market, we grow organically 6%, profit growth 20% per year, and this is like four, five years after we have acquired. So, I think you're going to see the same evolution with animal nutrition, and the margin up story that we mentioned originally for Neovia is intact.","Ken Zaslow","And then my next question and this will be my last question is, given how bullish you are on the oilseed environment, particularly with ASF, does this embolden you to pursue more M&A activity in this space to consolidate the industry, I know you've said this repeatedly that you know, it is the geographic place that you'd like to expand, as well as the industry needs to consolidate, so does this ASF embolden you take bigger actions?","Juan Luciano","I praise you Ken for your creativity to ask the consolidation question in a different way. We continue to be -- listen in oilseeds, we continue to be very bullish about that, we like the growth rates on that, and we are very much intending to have smart consolidations. If you will look at what we did with Algar, you look at what we did in Egypt with the joint venture with Cargill. And our teams continue to look at assets that fit our footprint well, that are an upgrade to our assets and if those are available, we're always looking.","Operator","Your final question for today will come from Eric Larson from Buckingham Research.","Eric Larson","Thanks, everyone. I know we're out of time, so my questions will be very brief. The first one is really a clarification question, and the way investors will be looking at your quarter here, you had a negative impact of $0.05 from a higher tax rate, negative $0.08 from weather-related issues, and then another $10 million in purchasing inventory adjustments from Neovia. So now that is $0.14 to $0.15 or kind of the $0.60 to $0.61 if we look at it from an investor point of view, is that a reasonable way to look at it? It is probably a question for Ray.","Ray Young","Yes. Just remember on the tax rate, remember, part of it is an adjustment item. So, therefore, the bulk of the reason why we were at a higher tax rate is due to the transition tax adjustments that we had in the quarter. That's an adjustment item. And so, as I indicated in my remarks, we're looking more like a 19% rate for the year, so that -- at least at this point in time, it's 19% if we exclude all those adjustment items. On the weather issues, as we indicated, part of that will get offset in the back half of the year. We're looking at probably some insurance settlements in order to mitigate some of those impacts, part of it, the volume we may be able to recover some of that. So, therefore the raw $16 million impact, there will be some mitigation toward that and, as I also indicated, the rest of the business, we were driving additional Readiness actions that will offset part of that as well.","On the $10 million in additional depreciation related -- yes, I mean that's an impact, and we didn't have that initially estimated because we couldn't estimate that number, but I kind of view that as in the quarter, I mean, that's just a one-time impact that we're going to have and so, just looking at the $60 million that we're going to have in terms of the impact is a segment OP tougher number. And so, I mean, again, we need to just make sure we separate out the segment OP impacts versus the tax rate impacts there too.","Eric Larson","And then my final question is, really talking about some of your bold moves that you had in the quarter, I don't think in my 25 or 30 years of covering the company, I have seen a product adjustment move like you -- like you're doing Marshall, the old ADM would have built more capacity to more front-end grind to supply the 42 market and you folks are not doing that, you're trying to get more return out of each plant and you just increase the size of the number of initiatives in your Readiness program. So when I look at -- so this is really positive for your returns going forward. When I look at this, I know you haven't changed your return profile in terms of your total goals, but certainly, this should give you more confidence that you can achieve a 10% ROIC. And maybe even at some point move higher, I mean how would you react to that thought?","Juan Luciano","Yes, that continues to be our objective. We never deviated from the desire to achieve 10% ROIC and 10% ROIC as a way to get to higher numbers. I think that the core businesses have done a tremendous job in that in improving ROIC and those businesses will continue to drive cash flow and Readiness and efficiencies to drive returns. That's the way they're going to create shareholder value. The Nutrition business that we have invested in is basically a growth option for the company and of course their returns are a little bit hampered right now by all the acquisitions and the goodwill that we are digesting, but their role to create shareholder value is through actually revenue growth and margin up, and they are doing that. So, we feel very good about our strategy and I think if something you have to learn or you probably know and that is what you're reflecting on is that there are no sacred cows for our team.","The most important thing is to focus on shareholder value creation and we will continue to do everything we can to drive value creation, either through returns in our base business or through organic growth in our nutrition division.","Operator","This brings our Q&A portion to a conclusion.

Good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. This morning we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.42 up from $0.88 in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was slightly above $1 billion. Our return on invested capital was 7.5% above both our 2019 WACC of 6.75% and our long-term WACC of 7%. We are continuing to drive towards our long-term ROIC goal of 10%. The team delivered solid results this quarter and I am proud of how they performed both over the last three months and throughout the year. We managed through a difficult external environment by keeping our focus on the strong execution, continued improvement efforts, and by providing winning solutions for our customers. And given our performance we are today announcing a quarterly dividend increase of $0.01 per share to $0.36 per quarter. This dividend will be our 353rd consecutive quarterly payment, an uninterrupted record of 88 years. ","I'm proud to look back on a year in which we delivered significant advancements in each of our strategic pillars. In our optimized pillar we advanced key business improvements and have seen the results of our work, a Decatur complex and in our Golden Peanut and Three Nuts business. We have reshaped our North American wheat milling footprint closing old less efficient mills and opening our brand new, state of the art facility in Mendota. We completed a significant global organization redesign including offering early retirement for certain North American colleagues and reducing management layers that is helping us enhance productivity and efficiency. And just in the fourth quarter we entered into an agreement to sell our palm plantation operations in Brazil and sold our investment in CIP advancing our ongoing efforts to ensure our asset portfolio maximizes returns and aligns with our core competencies. ","In our drive pillar we launched the Ag Services and Oilseeds business unit and we are delivering on the synergies created by simplifying the business model including capital reduction efforts. More widely as part of our readiness efforts we introduced a company-wide simplification initiative which is streamlining decision making and processes in order to drive accountability and realize additional value in the way we work. And we continued to drive standardization and efficiency by centralizing critical activities including our new global operations organization. ","In our expand pillar we expanded on our leadership position in the fast growing alternative protein through our partnership with Marfrig and by working with many other customers to create systems and solutions to meet their needs. We enhanced our global citrus platform with the addition of Florida Chemical and Ziegler and we cut the ribbon on our expansion and enhancement of our flavor production capabilities in Beijing. We created an unparalleled global leader in animal nutrition thanks to the addition of Neovia and I am extremely pleased with the integration including running ahead of our internal targets or synergies. And just in the last three months, in the last few months we further expanded our animal nutrition capabilities with the opening of our state of the art technology center in Decatur and our new feed production facility in Vietnam. ","We continue to build a leadership position in the key markets of food, beverages, and supplements that enhance health and wellness with the acquisition of Brazil based Yerbalatina phytoactives a pioneering leader in plant based extracts. And we further enhance our global destination marketing footprint this time expanding into Turkey capping a year in which our overall destination marketing volumes grew by 10%.","Let's turn to Slide 4, a year ago I called 2019 the year in which readiness would accelerate, moving beyond the introductory phase to become a driver of our culture and how we do our work every day. The enterprise had been laser focused on readiness which shows in our execution. By the end of 2019 we had completed 435 readiness initiatives that in total will account for $815 million in run rate benefits on an annual basis. We will remain on target to reach $1.2 billion in annual run rate benefits by the end of 2020. ","For 2019 specifically readiness has contributed approximately $250 million in accrued net benefits in line with our goal. I'm also proud that we achieved an important internal goal. As of the end of 2019 31,000 colleagues had completed our comprehensive ability to execute training since the program began. We continue to implement new innovative initiatives as a result of readiness. For example this quarter we will launch two new technologies. The first will help us more efficiently interact with our customers by providing new tools to our sales team. The second is allowing us to centralize and how to make our practice touch and tender in North America. ","What is even more impressive to see however is how our team has integrated readiness and its rigor and discipline into their everyday work. Our readiness evaluation and tracking system is now routinely applied to projects large and small alike. Then what else can we do to be better mindset is helping to guide actions and investments, become a part of who we are as a company which was one of our goals from the start. Now Ray will take us through our business performance. Ray.","Ray G. Young","Thanks Juan. Please turn to Slide number 5. As Juan mentioned adjusted EPS for the quarter was a $1.42 up from the $0.88 in the prior year quarter. The adjusted EPS number includes a benefit of about $0.61 per share related to the impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credits representing an approximately 50:50 split of retroactive benefits for 2018 and 2019. Excluding specified items adjusted segment operating profit was about $1 billion up 20%. For the full calendar year our adjusted segment operating profit was approximately $3.1 billion and adjusted EPS for the full year 2019 was $3.24. Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.5% higher than our 2019 annual WACC of 6.75%. ","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 was approximately a positive 1% credit compared to a positive 2% credit in the prior year. The calendar year 2019 effective tax rate was 13% compared to 12% in 2018. The low 2019 tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the U.S. tax credit signed into law at the end of the year. The low 2018 rate is due primarily to the impact of favorable true ups related to U.S. tax reform. In the absence of the tax credits and specified items the effective tax rate for calendar year 2019 would have been about 19%. Looking ahead we're expecting a full year 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 19%. ","We generate about $2.3 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, lower than 2018. Return of capital for the full year was about $940 million including about $150 million in operating share repurchases. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 29% up from 25% in the year ago quarter while continuing to improve from the first quarter high related to the acquisition of the Neovia. Capital spending for the year was $828 million in line with our guidance and considerably below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion as we focus on harvesting our prior investments. In 2020 we expect to continue to spend below our depreciation and amortization rate but higher than 2019 as we make investments in our business transformation program. ","Next slide please. Our business results were $13 million significantly above the prior year period. Captive insurance results were negative but significantly improved year-over-year. ADM Investor Services results were up versus the prior year period. For 2020 we expect claims and underwriting performance to improve for our captive insurance operations resulting in the expected other segment performance to be above $100 million for the calendar year. In the corporate lines unallocated cost of $193 million were higher year-over-year principally due to increased spending in IT and business transformation and higher benefits accrual costs. Other charges increased due to a $50 million railroad maintenance expense that had a corresponding exact benefit in tax expense partially offset by improved foreign hedging results in our intercompany funding. ","For 2020 corporate unallocated should be approximately $800 million with the increase from 2019 due to investments in IT, one ADM business transformation, R&D and innovation, transfers from the business segments into corporate centralized key activities, a return to normal incentive compensation accruals offset by the full year impact of savings from our workforce restructuring. Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than last year benefiting from lower short-term interest rates and proactive management of the debt portfolio despite overall higher debt levels to fund the Neovia acquisition. ","For 2020 we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be slightly below 2019. Corporate results also include a $0.24 per share loss on the sale of our interest in CIP comprised of a pre-tax loss of $101 million and the $32 million tax expense. It should be noted that we received pre-tax proceeds of $210 million in December from the sale from an original investment of $38 million made in 1988. You can see more data and background on the transaction in the additional facts and information section of this slide deck. In addition in corporate there were non-cash, early retirement, and global workforce restructuring charges about $0.01 a share and a $0.04 per share LIFO charge. ","Next I'll discuss our business segment performance for the quarter. Please turn to Slide 7. Ag Services and Oilseeds results were higher versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Ag Services results were slightly lower year-over-year. In North America the delayed U.S. harvest contribute to lower export volumes driving lower margins. In South America results benefit from improved margins driven by good export demand and farmer selling. In crushing results were lower year-over-year. Overall margins were solid though lower than the extremely high levels in the year ago period when global margins were being supported by the very short soybean crop in Argentina. ","Strength in the vegetable oil market contribute to a very good canola crush margin environment in North America. Year-over-year results were impacted by negative timing effects this quarter versus positive timing impacts in the prior year quarter. Refined products and other results were substantially higher. The impact of the passage of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit for 2018 and 2019 which contributed $270 million net to segment operating profit was a major driver. However even absent a tax credit our P&L delivered its best Q4 and in fact its best full year in recent history. We continue to see strong global demand for both biodiesel and food oils. In addition the Algar Agro acquisition in Brazil contributed positively to results.","Wilmar results were slightly higher year-over-year with its diversified business model performing well even with the backdrop of African Swine Fever impacting feed demand in China. Looking ahead we expect overall Ag Services and Oilseeds results to be lower in Q1 2020 than Q1 2019. Ag Services result should be in line with the year-over-year period. Crushing will be strong but still lower due to the very high crush margins driven in part by positive timing impacts in the year ago period. Our P&L should be slightly higher on continued good oil demand. ","We expect the impacts of the biodiesel tax credit to continue to support the biodiesel industry although the normalized impact for ADM in 2020 will be lower. For preliminary modeling purposes we assume about one sixth of the combined 2018 to 2019 impact but the actual net benefit will be a function of marketing conditions as we move through the year. Additionally we expect to see the ramp up of agriculture exports to China in the second half of the year. ","Slide 8 please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 and similar to the third quarter of 2019. Starches and sweetener results were up year-over-year. Improvements in manufacturing costs including in Decatur corn complex helps support strong results. As it is higher income from corn -- coal products in North America. In EMEA we began to see some improvements in margin conditions but results were lower year-over-year. Wheat milling results were up around globally. Bio products results were down compared to last year's fourth quarter due to continued unfavorable ethanol conditions and some risk management hedging losses. ","Looking ahead in Q1 we will begin reporting the Carbohydrate Solutions business in two sub segments; starches and sweeteners and Vantage Corn Processors or VCP. VCP is our newly created dry mill ethanol subsidiary which will also market ethanol produced at our wet mills. The results of VCP will thus cover the production of the three dry mill ethanol plants and the income from distribution of wet mill produced ethanol. The starches and sweeteners sub segment will include the results of all wet mill operations including ethanol production. For the first quarter of 2020 in starches and sweeteners we expect to continue to see the benefits of our improved manufacturing costs and anticipate EMEA results to be higher than the first quarter of 2019. We expect VCP to continue to be impacted by challenged industry ethanol margins. Absent any improvement in the ethanol industry margin environment for the rest of the first quarter we will expect the Carbohydrate Solutions segment results in Q1 to be down versus Q4 2019. ","On Slide 9 nutrition results were substantially higher year-over-year capping off a full year of 23% OP growth in the business and record results for WILD. For the quarter WFSI results were significantly higher than the prior year period with sales 8% higher on a constant currency basis and operating profits 40% higher year-over-year. The WILD team delivered another outstanding quarter as strong sales and margins in North America, EMEA, and APAC drove positive results. In specialty ingredients lower sales and margins and emulsifiers and reduced margins in edible beans are partially offset by continued margin growth in plant based proteins. Health and wellness results were up driven largely by a new strategic agreement for fermentation capacity. We believe that our leadership position in fermentation will continue to provide benefits for ADM in the coming years as our expertise and production capability will prove extremely valuable to cutting edge companies that are looking for new sustainable ways to create a wide variety of consumer and industrial products. ","Animal nutrition was up substantially versus the prior year period as Neovia continued to contribute positively to results partially offset by continued weak pricing environment for lysine globally. 2019 was an impressive year of growth for nutrition and we expect that growth story to continue in 2020. For the first quarter we anticipate overall nutrition segment results will be substantially higher than the first quarter of 2019 with growth in operating profit at around 20%. WFSI should be up on a continued customer demand for our on trend ingredients and our unparalleled expertise and service. Animal nutrition will continue to benefit from our Neovia acquisition and the execution of the synergies we've identified though we expect the global lysine pricing environment to remain challenged in the quarter. In addition year-over-year comparisons will benefit from last year's first quarter Neovia purchase price adjustment on inventory costs which negatively impact the results one time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Juan.","Juan R. Luciano","Thank you Ray. Let's turn to Slide 10. Earlier this month we unveiled a new corporate identity for ADM. The new identity builds on our purpose to unlock the power of nature, to enrich the quality of life, and reflects our evolution as a company. I'm proud of what we have accomplished in the five years since we purchased WILD both in terms of our nutrition segment results including our 23% year-over-year operating profit growth in 2019 but also in the unparalleled value proposition we offer our customers. Today our ability to work with our customers operating an industry leading array of products along with expertise and innovation to help them deliver unique solutions along with ADM systems sets us apart and put us in an unequal position to meet global consumer trends. And we are building the same capabilities in our animal nutrition business. ","Only a year in Neovia is performing above our expectations and we remain far ahead in the timing of achieving our synergy goals. We are going to continue to deliver on that growth story and drive margin growth in that business the same as we have done with WILD. With the momentum we have in the human nutrition business the accelerating growth of our health and wellness business and the second year of Neovia as part of our animal nutrition business we expect another year of 20% plus growth in profitability in our nutrition segment in 2020. At the same time we are continuing to drive results in the Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carb Solutions businesses which are a critical value creation engines for the company. This businesses have leadership positions in their respective markets but we know we can further improve. We remain focused on capital efficiency, portfolio management, and the use of technology and analytics to help drive cost and margin improvements in those segments. ","Despite all our accomplishments it's important to also focus on the things that did not go as planned in our execution in 2019. Our planned improvements in Decatur, corn, and seeds complexes although substantially complete took longer than expected and their overall results in 2019 were well behind their targets. Our new centralized Operations Center of Excellence will help make sure the plant improvements are implemented more effectively going forward. And despite the impressive results we have achieved with some of our recent investments, those growth projects have not reached their full potential. That is why in 2020 we are going to start to pivot our readiness focus initially placed more on efficiencies so we are harvesting our investments and driving commercial improvements and revenue growth. ","So as I look ahead to 2020 and beyond I see significant opportunities. We feel that external conditions should improve in the back half of the year particularly as it impacts from the Phase 1 agreement between the U.S. and China take hold. Nevertheless we are planning conservatively and focused on driving our own results for the year. We are focused on opportunities for business improvement including our ongoing strategic review of our dry mills and addressing lysine. We are advancing readiness and there is still more to harvest from our recent growth initiatives. We will be acting on all of these opportunities in 2020 while remaining focused on disciplined capital allocation and M&A as we continue to drive towards our 10% long-term ROIC objective. ","With all of these factors and without taking into account the benefits of the biodiesel tax credit we are targeting the delivery of pretax improvements of $500 million to $600 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Looking beyond 2020 as we continue to advance our strategy I am excited by the growth opportunities offered by evolving consumer trends and by the improvements and efficiencies we are continuing to execute across ADM. With that Jack please open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Eric Larson","Yeah, good morning everyone, thanks for taking my question. So I guess the first question here is when you look at -- obviously you've -- we've had biodiesel tax credits coming back into the market. Would that ultimately help your oil demand in 2020 and be more of a tailwind to your crush margins for the year?","Juan R. Luciano","Yeah, we are very positive about the oil demand into the year. We've seen demand outpacing capacity or production for most of the eight oils. We've seen Eric biodiesel not only the support of the tax credit in North America but also biodiesel mandates going up around the world. We are also seeing good demand for food oils and we're seeing a decline in the production of palm oil due to weather and fertilizer applications, so that has been tightening the market. So we've seen oil prices coming up. And also remember that we had a small rapeseed crop in Europe so that's also tightening little bit the balances. So I think that the oil story will support crush going into 2020 is our view. ","Eric Larson","Yeah, thank you. And then -- thank you Juan for that. And then just a little more flavor, I've been anticipating with the Phase 1 trade deal that it would be a gradual increase throughout the year but it seems to me that the setup for the fourth quarter when we're in harvest this year and hopefully we have much better conditions and much better environment to operate in, it seems like the fourth quarter setup could really be quite good because that's when our -- we're most competitive on global pricing. Is that thought process in sync with how you would look at that? ","Juan R. Luciano","Yeah, the way we have estimated it for our sales is back end loaded. So the exports to China are coming in the second half of the year. So yes, we expect at the time that we have all that pressure in the system. This export will come and that could improve margins by that point in the Q4 of 2020.","Eric Larson","Okay, thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Juan R. Luciano","Thank you Eric. ","Operator","Thank you. Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.","Ben Bienvenu","Thanks. Good morning everyone. I want to ask starting on crush and in Argentina in particular. I know you guys don't have crushing operations there but that's a pretty dynamic market, obviously experiencing significant financial distress and the number of crushers that are experiencing acute financial distress, just be curious to hear how you guys think Argentina is setting up for 2020 and could that ultimately be a market where crush is constricted and helps to support a global crush environment across the other geographies?","Juan R. Luciano","Yeah, thank you Ben. Listen, as you said Argentina starts 2020 with a number of challenges that are historically economic. They need to tackle the $100 billion debt, higher levels of poverty, inflation, and the government has very little room to maneuver so they have implemented all the export taxes. And as such the farmers are taking a very defensive position. So the farmers at this point in time they've sold a lot of grain in anticipation of export taxes. And today as an Argentine you cannot buy dollars to hedge against your devaluation. So basically you need to hold to the grain. So I think that the farmer will focus on financial management and cash flow management during the year. So they sold a lot in anticipation of the export taxes and they're going to be a reluctant seller for the rest of the year. ","So you're going to see and we're seeing right now the impact of that of Argentina being less of a export in the meal we see in the U.S. meal going into Europe recently whether it is Spain or Germany. Also going to Philippines so U.S. meal being the most competitive feed for places where non-traditional and traditional export markets for the U.S. So yes, we see these if we were to continue to be supportive of crush margins in North America and Europe for that matter.","Ben Bienvenu","Great, and I'd like to switch gears to the starches and sweeteners business. You talked about some improvement in co-products values that you've seen, I will be curious to hear kind of your outlook in the backdrop of the potential for U.S. China trade improving, that being supportive of the product values, and then also if you could provide any commentary on how the contracting season fared for 2020 and kind of what our expectations should be looking out to this year for pricing on the sweeteners basket?","Ray G. Young","Ben on the co-product value, a lot of this has been driven by the demand for vegetable oils or corn values have gone up and so that's really supported our overall core products from that business. As we kind of think through the rest of the year we do believe that with the contracts completed we will be able to maintain the margins that we had through the negotiations. Our overall starches and sweetener performance improvements will be directly a result of things that we can control.","So the recovery of the Decatur, some of the improvements we are doing over in EMEA, there is recovery in sugar prices over in Europe as well so lot of both factors will help drive improvements in our starches and sweetener business in 2020 compared to 2019.","Ben Bienvenu","Thanks so much.","Operator","Tom Simonich with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ","Tom Simonich","Good morning everyone. So you mentioned the benefits of Phase 1 will be back end loaded this year, but can you just give us some more details on exactly how the agreement has altered your outlook for regional soy crush margins and U.S. exports of soybeans and ethanol? And if you can rely on your latest assumptions around FX, that would be helpful? ","Juan R. Luciano","When we look at oilseeds, in general crush margins I would say, from an Oilseeds and Ag Services perspective as I explained to Eric before, we think that the exports will be backend loaded. So from an export elevation margins, if you will, that's where we think it's going to happen. From a crush perspective, we are positive in general to crush. The demand has been very good so far and I would estimate rates for meal had in the range of 3% to 4% for the U.S. So we feel good about that. As I mentioned, we've seen record weekly soybean meal exports recently to Spain, Germany, and the Philippines and that will be supportive of crush margins here in the U.S. ","So we think that meal bases will remain strong and even if all these China purchases come, we should be able to offset that potential bases gain for soybeans. Europe we have seen soy margins have firmed in recent weeks and they are in the $30 to $40 per metric tons a little bit on the Argentine not being that aggressive into Europe. And of course, grape margins are under pressure since we have a small grape, a small grape crop there. When we see China margins have been steady, around $30 to $35 per ton. Crush has been robust. Meal demand actually has been surprisingly resilient mostly on more feeding to hogs, but also in poultry and aquaculture that requires a lot of soybean meal. I would say if I go to Brazil, we have pretty good margins in Brazil. These are the best margins we've seen in quite some time in Brazil, mostly due to all the exports that are going to China. So with ASF, we've seen all those slaughterhouses exporting a lot to China so that that keeps a very robust demand there in Brazil. ","We have seen margins dropping in Paraguay to maybe -- crush margin to maybe $20, mostly because we've seen Argentine crushers go into to Paraguay to procure beans. So that has been the biggest, if you will, a negative impact that this Argentine situation we have had in crush margin. So that's how I see the world right now. With respect to ASF, we think that probably the worst is a little bit behind us in maybe 2019. The scenario developed a little bit as we predicted or as the experts predicted in which we saw that protein gap of maybe 20 million tons being filled mostly with imports and we see Brazil being very aggressive filling up those imports and we see the crush margins impact of that. We've seen also China reacting to that with more chicken and aquaculture and we see the crush margins there as well. We think that we're going to see the impact of U.S. exporting as well now with the Phase 1, because although U.S. exports grew it was still relatively small given that there were still import tariffs in place. ","So we see a progressive shift in the industry in China towards more professionalized farming in that regard and that used more soybean meal. So we see that as a positive. But we expect also for imports to continue our more elevated rates than in the past, even on a long term basis. So we expect the recovery over 2021 and 2022 becoming normal, but the new normal will be slightly different. ","Tom Simonich","That's very helpful. Thank you. And if we just switch to U.S. corn exports, the USDA is forecasting 2019-2020 exports down 14% but shipments are running down 53% today. When do you expect the U.S. corn exports to turn a corner and maybe you can just discuss the factors that have contributed to the weakness up to this point and we're hearing there have been some quality issues with this year's corn crop in the U.S. and if that is true, how is that impacting ADM mobility? ","Ray G. Young","Yeah, I would say with respect to the corn question of when we are becoming more competitive is right now. Right now we're becoming more competitive and I think that for the next two or three months window, the corn is -- the U.S. corn is the most competitive in the world. So you're going to see those exports pick up right now. With regards to quality yes, there are quality issues with these late crop and we're working through that. Quality is an issue, not yet a huge issue but it's an issue that at one point in time we could start driving farmers selling basically to get those products out of the pile. ","Tom Simonich","Thanks very much. I will pass it on. ","Operator","Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Ken Zaslow","Hey, good morning guys. I actually want to touch base on the $500 million to $600 million improvement. How much of that improvement actually is harvesting investments or savings coming down to the bottom line?","Juan R. Luciano","Yeah, I would say that if you remember how we build this kind of algorithm, this kind of math. We were going to have, we had in 2019 about $125 million of very unusual weather events. We normally have weather events, but this was one in the 40 years kind of event. So we're counting $125 million hopefully with more normalized weather we will not have. Then we have all these leakages that we will fix indicator, we will fix the lysine, we will fix Golden Peanut and some of those leakages we didn't complete, as I said before on time. And some of them have an overspill and we have an opportunity to get an extra maybe 50 million or a little bit north of 50 million in terms of leakages. Then we have the interventions that we made last year, the restructuring. There was about $200 million of potential savings but we captured only $80 million last year. So $120 million are coming in full fruition in 2020. ","Then we have the readiness that's going to contribute give or take another $250 million like they contributed this year. You know something between $200 million and $300 million, just $250 million to make it easy. And then we have the harvesting of some of the investments that we made and that's originally we have said something around the 100 million to 150 million. It is probably going to be a little bit higher than that since we underperformed a little bit on that in 2019. ","So those kind of kind of the algorithms, so that's where we feel comfortable Ken because these are things that we have invested already for. We just need to bring them to the P&L. Readiness is a pipeline of project that we have identified, not that we need to come up with those projects, we just need to execute into that. The interventions, I mean these are things that we normally transition into. And the leakages are well controlled. The Decatur plan has the highest scoring grind in two years in December. Our wood milling has been having great yields also in the Q4. Golden peanuts and Three Nuts is working well. So we feel good about our algorithm I would say.","Ken Zaslow","So you are not really actually incorporating a material improvement in actual underlying fundamentals. It is more internal of the 500 million to 600 million. The majority of that is still internal operating improvement. And if you were to get improvement in the trade in it exports from China, imports from China, or exports to China for ethanol, or corn or bases all that stuff that's not as much included in the numbers. Is that a fair assessment?","Juan R. Luciano","That is correct. When we plan and when we describe this number, this is all things that we can control. If we have a benefit from expansion of margins on a Phase 1 deal because of exports or other things that will be on top of these. We have planned some exports, of course, part of the deal, but we didn't plan a significant expansion of margins. We done the 500 to 600, all of the things that we can control, this scenario wouldn't change.","Ken Zaslow","My last question, if I do the math also and I do it 20% plus on the WFSI and nutrition business of the growth that's associated with that, obviously it's over indexing of the 500 to 600 relative to what the business represents as part of your core, what are the longer-term plans for that business, is that a business that should be part of ADM, is that a business that should be separated, how do you think of that as part of your portfolio, and how does it work within the portfolio or can it be a standalone to extract the incremental valuation, can you talk to that?","Juan R. Luciano","Sure yes. We are very excited, of course, about the nutrition business. If you think about the nutrition business evolution Ken and I think that I talked about the evolution because it's important in terms of the linkage with ADM if you will. This is a business that started from having specialty proteins out of oilseeds and lots of fibers and emulsifiers and other products out of corn. So these are businesses that are tied to that and they created the nutrition business. And then, of course, we added WILD flavors for human nutrition and human nutrition is, growing nicely. Then we added Neovia to complete our animal nutrition business and that's going very, very well. And now we are very excited about two development areas that we have; one is the health and wellness area with all the microbiome. And that's very synergistic with all the other stuff. That's very synergistic with human nutrition, that's very synergistic with animal nutrition as well. ","But we have a lot of opportunities there and running clinical trials and you saw the acquisition of Biopolis, the acquisition of Protexin, the acquisition now of Yerbalatina Phytoactives in the area of botanical. So that's an area that is going to receive a lot of attention and a lot of resources to grow. And then we have the insipient area of fermentation that Ray described before, which is all these companies that are looking for sustainable materials we are a fermentation company. We have a lot of capabilities, not only technical, but also asset wise. And that's an area that continues to grow. If you notice health and working capital 44% and I think that is still a small base, but you will continue to see. ","So not only we have a vibrant and growing nutrition business, but we have the roots or maybe the next nutrition business with that. So at this point in time, we continue to invest in that. We think that they are going to become the higher percentage of ADM operating profit and hopefully valuation will reflect that at the proper time. If we see that, that growth is not reflected in valuation, we will look at how to unlock that value. There are no sacred cows and you know us Ken and we're going to be very focused on unleashing that value. But at this point in time, we feel that the integration works well. We feel that the different business models don't conflict to each other. And they are very synergistic at this point. So we feel good about it. ","Ken Zaslow","I really appreciate it. Thank you. ","Juan R. Luciano","You're welcome. ","Operator","Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. ","Michael Piken","Yeah, hi, I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper in terms of the sweetener and starches. I know you said -- you mentioned you were going to hold, hoping to hold the margin, but maybe you could provide us any sort of update on how the high fructose corn syrup negotiations have gone? ","Ray G. Young","Like we mentioned, I mean they're completed. And I think in general we're able to maintain the margins that we had last year from a gross margin perspective, which by the way are healthy, right. I mean, we have been able to sustain that over the past couple of years. Really driving the improvements, it really is to the things that we can't control. And as one indicator, we did have leakages in the Decatur complex. It took us a while in order to kind of get the complex to be running at the rate that we want to. We got that done at the end of the year, but frankly, we thought we could get done sooner in the year. So that's going to be a positive delta for us in the starches and sweetener segment. We had weather issues, as you know earlier in the year. High water conditions shut down some of our corn plants. We're hoping that doesn't repeat itself. That should be a positive delta also in terms of the starches and sweeteners segment. ","And then we've had some issues over in EMEA, over in Europe, whether it be at their Chamtor facility or over the Central European facilities. We've had an improvement in terms of market conditions as we move to the back part of the year. And so hopefully that will continue, that should present a positive delta also in terms of our starches and sweetener segment. So again, on things that we can control or some of the factors over in Europe, those are all positive tailwinds for our starches and sweetener business in 2020. ","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And then I know it's a little bit early to tell but with the Coronavirus spreading throughout China. I mean, what impact or potential impact could that have on your business and I guess more specifically, I guess see if you could figure out a little bit between Ag Services and maybe kind of the potential Wilmar business and whatever. But just trying to understand how this might have any impact on your business would be helpful? ","Ray G. Young","Yeah. So, Mike, of course, I will first go out to those guys who have been impacted by the virus and we are monitoring the situation and the safety of our employees pretty closely. Actually, ADM have donated 150,000 to the China Red Cross to help their efforts to contain the virus. At this point in time, the impact to us in ADM is it's very difficult to assess so early on. We have about 1100 employees in China, but our direct profits in China are small. Of course, our exposure is through Wilmar. Wilmar has two locations in Wuhan and of course, they are currently shut down because of Chinese New Year and we will wait for the authorities to see how those operations will come back. Shanghai is shut down until February 9th. We know that no employees from Wilmar has been infected. And, of course, since Wilmar was going to shut down for Lunar New Year, they had inventory of products. So for normal demand, we can -- they will be able to supply. We don't know exactly what's happening with distribution at this point in time within China, since the information is relatively scarce. ","So at this point in time Wilmar issued a press release saying that we don't expect any significant impact to their businesses. So, of course, probably people going out, that type of entertainment and dining will be reduced. So some of the bulk products may be -- bulk consumer products could be impacted in demand, but people will have to eat inside anyway. So in that sense, more the packaged foods would probably pick up a little bit. So at this point in time, we don't expect a significant impact in our business. How could that impact ADM in general, we are in a very fundamental business, which is the business of food. So I think that we will be impacted to the extent that GDP, the global GDP will be impacted and that will depend on the magnitude of that. And hopefully the very high alert and very high response of the Chinese government will contain this. So again, we are trying to make everything possible, even contributing funds to help with the containment of this virus.","Michael Piken","Thank you. ","Operator","Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Your line is open. ","Heather Jones","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. My first question is just as a clarification on two points. First, Ray, did you say that ANO operating income is anticipated to be flat for the full year in 2020 versus 2019 or were you referring to some sub segment of ANO?","Ray G. Young","Are you referring to Ag Services and Oilseeds? ","Heather Jones","Yeah. [Multiple Speakers]. basically a full year? ","Ray G. Young","No, no, we didn't provide any full year Ag Services and Oilseeds. We were saying that basically looking at for Q1 overall Ag Services and Oilseeds should be lower but Ag Services. So the Ag Services part of Ag Services and Oilseeds should be in line with the year-over-year. ","Heather Jones","For Q1? ","Ray G. Young","For Q1, all this is Q1. ","Heather Jones","Yeah, okay. And another clarification, on your 500 million to 600 million for the year, you're not including a benefit from the BTC in that? ","Ray G. Young","No, we're not. That's right. I mean, all that is excluding biodiesel tax credit impacts. So the year-over-year comparison does not have the BTC in any of it and doesn't have the BTC in 2020. Just to make it an easy comparison for you. ","Heather Jones","Okay, good. And then my other question is in Argentina. So thank you for the new slides and the slide deck. They're very helpful. I was a little confused by the Argentina numbers. You're actually showing them a little lower than they were and at the time of your call for Q3 and everything we're seeing and reading and then the dynamics there with this and all. It's all pointing to higher. So I'm just wondering if there's something I'm missing or if you could just help us understand that? ","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. As you know we have no crushers there. But everything So you as you know, we're not the pressures there. So but -- everything we see at this point points to those near-by margins of about maybe single-digit margins. Of course, if you look at April or when you have the harvest, you're going to see more $10 to $15 maybe per ton but that's on paper right now, because right now the farmer is not selling the new crop. So we're seeing some people crushing unpriced beans and as I said, we've seen crushers going all the way to Paraguay to get the beans. So that not an inexpensive way to supply yourself. So that's what is creating the compression to be honest. But that's all we know at this point in time. ","Heather Jones","But is it your anticipation that given the export taxes you mentioned earlier, these issues with the Centene and all is it your full expectation that Argentina will crush less this year or would you expect -- how are you thinking about their full year activity? ","Juan R. Luciano","Yeah. I think that Argentina maybe will crash the same amount. But I think it will be difficult to convince the farmer to give away the beans. As I said, as an Argentine you can, the only way to protect yourself from inflation and devaluation is to be in dollars. And you cannot buy more than $200 today. So if you sell your crop, you cannot buy dollars. So people are holding to the crop because the crop preserves the value in dollars. So unless the government does something different and changes the conditions that they are today, today the farmer will be a hoarder of their grain for the rest of the year. So my point is you will have to pay up because the farmer will only sell it when the prices are impossible to ignore. So that that's kind of my view at this point in time. ","But, things are very dynamic Heather. I mean, it's so difficult to project a year in Argentina. So I would say that's the situation right now. By the end of March, Argentina concludes or supposed to conclude the negotiations why they are mapping double structure in the debt, that will be very important time to assess the year for Argentina, because then you're going to know what could be done from a government perspective. At this point in time there's very little room to maneuver and it's very difficult to predict in a highly political environment. ","Heather Jones","Okay, thank you so much for the color. ","Juan R. Luciano","You're welcome, Heather. ","Operator","Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Robert Moskow","I think. Good morning. Juan, I think you said that China took in about 20 million metric tons of soybean meal. I couldn't tell if that was all from Brazil or a lot from Brazil. As the U.S. becomes a bigger part of the export market after Phase 1 do you think it's kind of a zero some game where Brazil exports less, or do you think that overall China is just going to have to export or import more based on the timing of the herd rebuilding? And then I have a follow up. ","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. Let me clarify it Rob. I didn't mention that the U.S. and soybean meal to China. I said two things. I said that the U.S. has been exporting meal to nontraditional destinations like Spain and Germany and Philippines. And then I said that the soybean meal demand in China has been resilient because of feeding more pigs and actually posted growth and aquaculture growth there, so sorry if I confused you with all those things. Regarding shifting between Brazil and Argentina, Brazil and the U.S. listen, I do believe that China intends to comply with the Phase 1 conditions of the deal. So in that sense, that has to come at the expense of Brazilian exports. So I think to a certain degree it is going to be a zero-sum game in which Brazil will export less if the U.S. will export more to China.","Robert Moskow","Got it, okay, I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Operator","Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Steven Haynes","Thank you guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think SG&A on a GAAP basis was up close to a 100 million. Are there any kind of onetime items in there or is that just the year-over-year comparison this year with Neovia being in the results now, so how should we be thinking about the SG&A kind of on an underlying basis is what I'm getting at? ","Ray G. Young","Yeah, you're exactly right. And when you think about comparison, I'd look at GAAP SG&A on a year-over-year basis. There's been an actually the acquisitions that we've made Neovia, SCC Ziegler. Basically the SG&A cost actually come into the 2019 GAAP statements. So that that accounts for the majority of the increase that we've seen in SG&A which also had some investments in IT and the business transformation and then that's partially offset by the savings that we've had regarding our workforce restructuring. The other thing to note is SG&A when we start bringing in more the nutrition business into ADM, naturally the SG&A will go up. This is a S component associate with nutrition on SG&A. So as our business mix continues to move towards more nutrition, you will see a little bit more on the SG&A line and that's primarily driven by the S part of it. ","Steven Haynes","Thanks guys. ","Operator","Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Adam Samuelson","Hi, good morning. I was hoping Juan and Ray if you could talk a little bit on the corn side, just where we are on the strategic review advantage and just help us think about kind of the process there and what you see as the pathway to maybe separating that business over time and just in time on there?","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. So I think the team has done a good job on creating the wholly owned subsidiary, VCP that was launched on December 1st, as a sub segment of Carbohydrate Solutions. I said it publicly and we're still discussing with a few parties. I can characterize those discussions in an advanced stage. So hopefully we will get to a resolution on that. We have a couple of alternatives, different type of deals that we're looking at. In the meantime, we think that some things have clarified itself since the last time we talked or at least presented a little bit of a better medium term perspective for this business. Of course ethanol is included in the Phase 1 agreement with China. So that's encouraging news. ","We have seen recently the courts issue on the SRD waivers. And that's a positive, that spike brings today that that happens is it sets a good precedent. And we have seen also sugar prices come up over 20% since September, which is another important thing, as you know, that ethanol competes with sugar in Brazil for the production of that. So I think some encouraging signs for the medium term. And there are a lot of despite the short-term difficulties, there seems to be significant interest in various parties to gain scale of economies. And you know we have the largest dry meals out there. So this is very important for consolidation place. So we're still optimistic about getting something done. ","Adam Samuelson","Right, that's very helpful. Then just a quick one for Ray on the unallocated corporate expense going up to $800 million, anyway you can kind of just some of the key pieces of that year-on-year increase. I think you noted you're going to take some cost out of segments, specifically, how much is that and where will that be coming out? Just so we're clear and moving this? ","Ray G. Young","Yeah. I mean, basically going up by roughly $150 million but I mean, a lot of it is the business transformation whereby we're making the investments so we are putting in the S for us investment into the company. So that's going to be a chunk of it. R&D ventures, we continue to invest in innovation, which is very important for the company. And then centralization. As we centralize global operations, as we centralized purchasing, as we centralized some of the global business services. That's going to be a shift in costs from the business units over to the central at corporate allocated. So those are the main components of why the number will be going up overall. ","Adam Samuelson","Alright, super, I'll pass it on. Thanks. ","Operator","And we have time for one final question. Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. ","Eric Larson","Okay, thank you everyone. Just two really quick follow-ups. One, so funds for one. The nutrition business is really kind of a fall into Ken's question. The nutrition business is really starting to hit full stride here. Consistent with your comments that what happened several years ago and I think your goal is that or your belief is that this division can be as much as 25% of total corporate profits. So if you look at last year's number of your total segment profits, that's roughly a double from here at some point. Can you share with us your thoughts as to the cadence of how that would come over without obviously giving no guidance per say, but how does that flow of earnings look for you over, let's say, the next two to three years for nutrition? ","Juan R. Luciano","Yes. The objective is still there to get nutrition to be about 25% OP. Of course, we don't want to do it by reducing the OP of other businesses. So that's why we focus on how much nutrition grows year-over-year. You heard Ray saying before we grew operating profits, 68% in the quarter and 23% year-over-year. So basically every year nutrition is kind of high in the quarter to the year, if you will, which is very impressive. We plan to do it the way we build it so all the way to now. So every now and then, we have a major acquisition that we did with Wild Flavors in 2014, then we did Neovia in 2018. So it was four years apart. In the meantime, in the in between, we did some bolt on, we did some organic growth and we're going to do the same based on our capital allocation and our returns discipline. So we are very, very mindful of that and we want to stick to that. ","So think about it again, our three main thrusts; one is human nutrition. That will continue to grow aggressively more than the market. Then we have animal nutrition. That's the same with the Neovia boost and the margin improvement story there. And then we have where we are probably going to be putting more money is the area of health and wellness and the area of fermentation. Those are the areas that are growing very fast. But they are still very, very tiny today. And that's where you're going to see the acceleration. But I would say that the strategy will not change significantly in the sense that we're going to have some transformational deals every now and then. But then bolt ons and organic growth and that's the way we build it. We expect to get to 25%, if that's the question probably within the next three to four years. ","Eric Larson","Okay, perfect. Thank you for that insight. And then one final question, this is for Ray. Ray, you took a large asset impairment charge in the quarter, where did that charge come in, was it ethanol assets?","Ray G. Young","No, no, it is mainly Ag Services, Oilseeds assets. As we -- we kind of help, there is a term we use precision EVA whereby we're looking at all the assets very carefully, determining what makes sense for us to keep, sell or fix or basically dispose. And so we took some charges related to some vessels, oceangoing vessels, we took some charges related to some businesses that we're going to divest. And we took some charges related to some operations which, we're going to restructure. So I view it as part of the overall precision EVA that Ag Services and Oilseeds team is working on right now. ","Eric Larson","Okay, thanks for the clarity. We'll talk soon. ","Juan R. Luciano","Thank you Erich. And now if you would\u2026 Go ahead Jack. ","Operator","The Q&A session has now ended. I would now like to turn the call back to Victoria de la Huerga for final remarks. ","Victoria de la Huerga","Thank you for joining us today.
