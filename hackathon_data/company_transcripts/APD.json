Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' third quarter 2017 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases.","After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and in today's earnings release. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that due to the hard work and commitment of our people at Air Products, we delivered another quarter of very strong performance, with EPS growth of 15% over last year. This is the 13th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-over-year EPS growth.","We also delivered excellent safety results and generated over $500 million of distributable cash flow this quarter. Our volumes are up 8%, the highest in more than two years, and we continue to win and execute successfully on major industrial gas projects for customers around the world.","Now please turn to a slide number 3, where I would like to take a few minutes to remind everyone of the progress we have made. Specifically, I want to talk about the promises we made three years ago and the results we have delivered. In 2014, we made several commitments to ourselves and to our shareholders. And as I recall, there may have been skepticism in the investment community at the time about our ability to deliver.","So let us update you on where we are today. Three years ago, we said that Air Products will be the safest industrial gas company in the world, we will be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, we will divest our non-core assets, we will have the best balance sheet in the industry and we will deliver 10% per year EPS growth every year. I am proud of our team for delivering on every one of these promises.","On slide number 4, you can see the results of the first two commitments. We are today the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have delivered significant improvement in our employee lost-time injury rate and we have an EBITDA margin of 34%, which is up 900 basis points versus three years ago.","On slide number 5, you can see our success in divesting non-core assets. We sold our chemical business to Evonik for almost 16 times EBITDA, and I'm confident this business and the people involved will thrive in Evonik.","We spun off our Electronic Materials business as an independent company called Versum Materials. The Versum team is 100% focused on the electronic market as a leading material supplier. They have delivered strong results and the Versum stock is currently trading at over 13 times EBITDA, in fact, a higher multiple than Air Products right now. And as you saw this morning, the great management team there delivered very strong results also.","Slide number 6 shows the results of our improved business performance and the successful transaction. Air Products has the strongest balance sheet in the industry. So we are well positioned to take advantage of the tremendous growth opportunities in industrial gases. That is our future and, as you can see, we had delivered EPS growth of 10% in 2015, 16% in fiscal year 2016, and at the mid-point of our 2017 guidance, we will be up another 10%.","To summarize on slide 7, the hardworking and committed team at Air Products has delivered on what we promised. And what is most exciting to me right now is that we are very well positioned to grow Air Products and create significant further value for our shareholders. We now have the balance sheet to do it.","Let me review the investment opportunities we see for this growth that I'm talking about. First, acquisitions of small size and medium size industrial gas companies, or assets or businesses from other industrial gas companies. Second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customers based on a fixed fee. We see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category.","We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units and sale of syngas to customers under long-term agreement. Essentially, these opportunities are the same as the traditional onsite business model that we have, something that we do every day, but with existing rather than new production assets.","And the third area of opportunity is the very large industrial gas projects around the world driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy and emerging markets. The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these projects can be. The plant we are building in Jazan is the largest project in the history of industrial gas industry, with close to $2 billion of capital investment. Some of these new large projects that I'm talking about could also include gasification and syngas supply and could be as big or even bigger than Jazan.","Scott will take you through the details, but like last quarter, the estimate that we will have at least $8 billion of capacity to invest over the next three years. And I truly believe that Air Products will be successful in utilizing our balance sheet to invest in our core Industrial Gases business to create significant shareholder value. But as I have always said, if we can't find good enough good projects, we will stay disciplined and return the cash to our shareholders; after all, it is your money.","And I know everybody continues to be interested in a timeline for deploying the cash. But as I have said, we are not in a hurry and we will take our time to make sure that we are investing in value-generating projects.","Now please turn to slide number 8, where you can see examples of the success that Air Products has had with major projects around the world. Just in the past quarter, we announced new Electronis wins in China, a new HyCO facility in Louisiana and a new air separation unit in New York. These new wins will drive growth for Air Products and create value for our shareholders. As importantly, our teams are executing well on our projects in the backlog. We successfully brought onstream a major hydrogen plant in India and another major oxygen plant in China.","Now, please turn to the slide number 9, that shows another quarter of very strong safety performance. These results do not happen without everyone of our team around the world being focused on safety every single day. I also believe these results also reflect an empowered and focused culture that also creates good financial results.","Slide number 10 is our goal for the company. As I explained at the beginning of this call, we have made great progress and are determined to continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.","Now, please turn to the slide number 11, our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you many times. We continue to be focused on shareholder value, cash generation, capital allocation, and empowered and decentralized organization. And slide number 12, that you have seen many times before, is our Five-Point Plan which is the roadmap for our success.","Slide number 13 shows you the results of our three key metrics. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these three metrics. And today, we are the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each one of these metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward.","Now please go to my favorite slide, slide number 14. It's obviously great to see that the margins improved versus last quarter. Also as you know, when natural gas prices are higher, we report higher sales with no profit, since the costs are passed through to our customers. Excluding this impact on natural gas, actually EBITDA margins were 30 basis points higher versus last year.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be more than happy to answer your questions. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, Seifi. Now please turn to slide 15 for a more detailed review of our Q3 results. Sales of $2.1 billion increased 11% versus last year on 8% higher volumes. This was our best volume performance in at least two years. Higher energy cost pass-through added 5%, while the currency impact was 2% unfavorable. Volumes were higher across all the three regions, and taken together, the regions increased overall volumes by 8%.","In our sale of equipment businesses, continued progress on our Jazan project was largely offset by the continued weakness in LNG. Overall, pricing remains unchanged, with increases in Asia being offset by weakness in Europe.","EBITDA of $722 million improved by 7%, and operating income of $463 million improved by 11%. EBITDA margin of 34% decreased by 120 basis points and was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from higher energy cost pass-though. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margin was up 30 basis points.","Operating margin of 21.8% was unchanged versus prior year as unfavorable energy pass-through of 90 basis points was offset by favorable volumes. Sequential margins improved by more than 100 basis points driven by higher volumes. Versus prior year, net income increased by 16%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 15%.","ROCE of 12.2% improved by 10 basis points versus last year and was down 10 basis sequentially. To provide you with some context, sequentially, ROCE is down slightly while profits are up because the denominator of the ROCE calculation has increased. The denominator is based on a five-quarter average and this now includes two quarters that contain a significantly higher denominator as a result of the PMD gain.","Now, please turn to slide 16. As you know, Air Products continues to be very focused on cash flow. Our distributable cash flow was over $500 million this quarter, while our free cash flow was $139 million. Free cash flow was up $47 million versus last year, due to higher EBITDA. Year-to-date distributable cash flow is $1.3 billion, while our free cash flow is approximately $200 million.","Please turn to slide 17. Before I discuss our underlying results, I want to spend a moment on non-GAAP items. In continuing operations, we had non-GAAP charges that totaled $1.18 per share. In Latin America, during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 volumes declined and overall revenue growth was below our previous forecast due to weak Latin American economic conditions and a lack of recovery in mining-related demand. Our current outlook is now below the previous forecast used to establish the carrying value of the business. As a result, our goodwill review resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $162 million or $0.70 per share.","We also completed a review of the business plan and resulting outlook associated with Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases, or AHG, a 25%-owned equity affiliate. We determined there was a decline in the value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $80 million, or $0.36 per share, that reduces the carrying value of our investment. The decline in value results from expectations for lower future cash flows to be generated by AHG, primarily due to weaker economic conditions in Saudi Arabia. The team is working hard to implement a profit improvement plan.","Let me add that while no one can predict the future, at this time, we do not believe we will have similar impacts resulting from other acquisitions we have made in the past. And with our focus on capital allocation, we are highly confident that future M&A transactions will create value for our shareholders.","Finally, cost reduction and asset actions continue through the year as we take further actions as part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and to offset stranded costs from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. The charge of $43 million, or $0.14 per share, includes the planned sale of a Latin American hardgoods business and closure of an LNG heat exchanger manufacturing facility. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.","Turning to slide 18, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Excluding non-GAAP items, our Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.65 increased $0.21 per share, or 15%, versus last year. Higher volumes broadly increased EPS by $0.19 per share. Pricing and power costs, taken together, decreased EPS by $0.01. This was driven in part by higher power cost in our Europe business.","On a positive note, we saw significant pricing improvement this quarter in China. Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.02, as our productivity actions and the TSA income were more than offset by other costs including maintenance and inflation. We remain committed to delivering our $100 million of cost savings this year. As a reminder, included in the cost major factor is the other income (expense) line on our consolidated P&L.","As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements, or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik. The cost to provide these services are primarily in SG&A. The payment we received for these services was about $10 million this quarter and is shown in the other income (expense) line. We expect these TSAs to wind down in 2018 and are committed to taking actions to reduce the resulting stranded costs. For the quarter, currency and foreign exchange gains and losses net to $0.01 unfavorable.","We added a new line to our income statement last quarter called other non-operating income (expense). This is where we are reporting the interest income from our more than $3 billion of cash and short-term investments. The interest income was about $0.03 this quarter. Since this is non-operating, it is not included in our EBITDA or operating income results. Interest expense was $0.02 lower due to our lower debt balance partially offset by higher rates.","Our effective tax rate this quarter was 24%, about 1% lower than last year. We still expect our FY 2017 tax rate to be approximately 23%.","Turning to slide 19, I would like to update you on our capital deployment capacity. We have about $3.3 billion of cash in short-term investments as of June 30. After we pay the remaining taxes due on the PMD gain and maintain a modest operating cash balance, we have about $2.9 billion of cash available to invest. Our debt balance as of June 30 is about $3.9 billion.","As you know, we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A\/A2 rating. We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Based on a trailing 12-month EBITDA of $2.7 billion, this would support a debt level in the range of about $5.5 billion to $7 billion. So in total, between available cash and additional debt capacity, we have about $5 billion we can deploy today, while maintaining our A\/A2 rating. As we have mentioned, we also expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investable cash, that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx and dividends.","So as Seifi mentioned, over the next three years, we expect to have a total of at least $8 billion available to invest.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call cover to Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. This was our best quarter for both safety and volumes, since we began reporting on a regional basis in FY 2015. Our teams had worked hard to safely bring onstream large new projects and win merchant customers around the world. While this performance is very good, we have more work to do on productivity.","We generated significant savings from our Taking the Lead productivity actions, but these were impacted by a number of offsetting cost items. The good news is that we continue to see productivity opportunities. I would like to again thank our people around the world for staying focused on our goals, especially safety, excellent customer service and our Taking the Lead productivity projects.","As an example of Taking the Lead, improving compressor efficiency is an opportunity for us. Compressors consume most of the power at an air separation plant, we have many of them and we have many plants. So you can't have an engineer sitting next to every compressor. So we continue to develop remote diagnostic tools to identify opportunities and take actions across our global fleet of compressors. These actions drive both productivity and enhance reliability.","Before I discuss the regions, I'm going to address helium. Industrial gases is primarily a local business, but helium has a global supply chain. The recent events in Qatar disrupted that global supply chain. Clearly, this is not over yet and the situation remains volatile, but we are confident that we can take good care of our customers through this.","Air Products has a geographically diversified supply base. Our wholesale commitments take a big step down at the end of this month and we have a new tranche of helium supply coming on in January. Beyond that, we bought over 75% of the helium at offer at the BLM auction two weeks ago. So we are confident that we can continue to provide excellent service to our customers, whatever happens in the Gulf region.","Now please turn to slide 20 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Volumes were up 3%, the best volume performance in over two years. The pass-through of higher energy prices, with the Houston Ship Channel natural gas prices up almost 70%, significantly diluted our margins again this quarter.","Sales of $930 million were up 12% versus last year, with volumes up 3% and higher energy cost pass-through up 9%. North American volumes were up on modest merchant growth across most of our product lines and strong hydrogen volumes as our refinery customers continue to operate at a high level. Hydrogen volumes were also stronger sequentially, following customer planned outages in Q2.","Latin American volumes were up slightly this quarter versus prior year, led by the liquid bulk business. However, economic activity remains weak. Results improved sequentially as expected on seasonality. EBITDA of $367 million was up 1% as the contribution from higher volumes and our Taking the Lead cost reduction programs were partially offset by planned maintenance-related costs. EBITDA margin of 39.5% was down 400 basis points, with higher energy cost pass-through accounting for about 330 basis points. Excluding this impact, the margin was down about 70 basis points.","As I mentioned last quarter, we will be shedding about $70 million in annual wholesale volumes in North America, beginning next month with the end of our supply contract for liquid bulk products to Airgas. I am encouraged to see our sales efforts paying off and volumes building as we are working hard to replace this volume with retail sales.","We had two significant project announcements since our last earnings call. First in June, we announced Air Products will retire our 1970s-era plant and build a new highly efficient air separation unit in Glenmont, New York, providing additional liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the merchant market.","Ours is a long-term business and this is an example of investing for the future. And just recently, we announced the award of a carbon monoxide and hydrogen supply contract from Huntsman to supply their world scale MDI facility in Geismar, Louisiana. We will be building a new steam methane reformer to supply Huntsman and connecting it to our 600-mile hydrogen pipeline system.","Now, please turn to slide 21. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the volume growth was driven primarily by our new hydrogen plant in India. Versus last year, sales of $452 million were up 5%, with volumes up 6%, price down 1%, higher energy cost pass-through up 4%, and currency down 4%. The currency impact was primarily the British pound, and other than the continued currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit discussions have had much impact on our business this quarter.","Our new hydrogen and ASU project for BPCL in India was fully onstream as of the end of Q3. As a reminder, this one 100% Air Products-owned facility will be reported in the EMEA segment, while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in the Asia equity affiliate income. Excluding the impact of our new hydrogen plant, our underlying volumes were positive on strength in tonnage and packaged gases. These gains were partially offset by lower equipment sales and a project close-out.","Reported price was down 1%, as a mix effect, both in terms of customer mix and product mix, offset slightly higher underlying real pricing. So, when we say price, we mean exclusively merchant pricing. And when we say real price, I mean the same gas sold to the same customer. Although underlying real price is positive, we were not able to recover as much of the higher power costs as we had hoped to in this quarter. And I can assure you, our team continues to be very focused on pricing.","EBITDA of $155 million was down 3%, but that would have been slightly up on a constant currency basis. Positive cost performance and higher equity affiliate income were offset by equipment and the negative mix and cost impacts. EBITDA margin of 34.3% was down 310 basis points, with a higher energy pass-through accounting for about 140 basis points. Excluding this impact, the margin was down 170 basis points about evenly impacted by equipment and mix costs.","Please turn to slide 22, Gases Asia, where we showed very strong volume and profit growth. Sales of $538 million were up 20%, driven by volume growth of the same amount. About half of the volume growth was due to equipment sale projects, which we would not expect to reoccur in Q4. The remaining 10% of the growth was approximately evenly split between new project onstreams and base business growth.","Our ongoing drive for retail sales and pricing, aided by the consolidation of the steel industry, is paying off. The Asia merchant gas business continues to improve in terms of both measures, retail sales and pricing. For example, LOX\/LIN volumes were up high single-digits and the retail business was up low double-digits. And in China, this was even more dramatic, with mid-teen retail growth, that was about 2x our total LOX\/LIN growth rate. At the same time, LOX\/LIN prices were up nearly 4%.","Our gains in argon were even more dramatic, with total volume, retail volume and pricing, all three up double-digits. We need to keep in mind that there is still significant overcapacity in China and a recovery in this market may be bumpy, but our efforts clearly delivered.","EBITDA of $211 million was up 15%, with strong contributions from higher volumes, including the equipment sales and on higher pricing. We had Taking the Lead cost savings, but this was somewhat offset by a positive cost reimbursement in Q3 last year. We expect to receive this in Q4 this year. Equity affiliate income was down due to a one-time benefit last year. This impacts EBTIDA, but not operating income.","EBITDA margin of 39.2% was down 160 basis points on the items just referenced. We continue to win and successfully execute projects throughout Asia. In the electronics area, we were pleased to be awarded the industrial gas supply for Fujian Jinhua's new memory fab in Fujian Province and SMIC's foundry capacity expansion in Tianjin.","And we successfully brought on another very large air separation complex to supply oxygen, nitrogen, and air to Yitai Chemical's fine chemical coal gasification project in Inner Mongolia. These plants have a combined capacity of over 9,000 tons a day, and join our other successful oxygen for coal gasification projects in China, including Weihe Clean Energy, Pucheng Clean Energy, Shaanxi Future Energy, and Shanxi Lu'an Mining.","Finally, please turn to slide 23 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales and profits were up versus prior year, driven by progress on the Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. We continue to make good progress on the Jazan project, and just as a reminder, we began booking profits on the sale of equipment in the fourth quarter of FY 2016.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a comment on our Corporate segment.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 24, our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our corporate costs. Sales and profits were down versus last year, as expected, on continued significantly lower LNG project activity. We were pleased to announce earlier this week a new project with TP JGC Coral France to provide our technology and heat exchanger equipment for the Coral South Floating LNG project to be located in the Indian Ocean, offshore Mozambique.","However, we had anticipated this win, so still expect about a $0.30 headwind in LNG for FY 2017 versus FY 2016. We still have not yet seen other LNG customers moving forward with their investment decisions. We did see a positive impact from the TSAs with Evonik and Versum.","Now please turn to slide 25 and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, again, Simon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook. Having delivered on our promises from three years ago, we can now build on our success. We have significant opportunities to invest our cash to grow Air Products and create value for our shareholders. Our safety and operating performance continues to be strong. We continue to take action to deliver our $100 million of operational improvements this year and are focused on additional actions to offset the stranded costs from the separation of MT business. We remain committed and confident on our ability to deliver on our cost savings and our commitment to grow EPS by 10% each year.","Our portfolio actions and the strong cash flow generation of our company provide us with almost $8 billion of capacity to invest over the next three years. We are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident the risk\/return profile will create significant value for our shareholders. And as I said, I am now, more than ever, very confident that we will have the opportunity to fully utilize our balance sheet by investing in exciting opportunities in M&A, asset buybacks, and large industrial projects.","Now, please turn to the slide number 25. With confidence in our ability to perform, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2017. Our increased guidance of $6.20 to $6.25 is up $0.10 from last quarter at midpoint, and it represent 10% EPS growth over 2016. And our guidance for the fourth quarter the fiscal year EPS is $1.65 to $1.75 (sic) [$1.70] per share, which at midpoint is 12% up versus last year.","I want to thank once again the great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented, and motivated employees that remain focused on being the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. I am very proud to be a member of this winning team.","Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question from Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. This is Emily Wagner on for Don. I just wanted to dial in to the Jazan earnings this quarter a little bit. How much of the guidance raise was due to the timing of Jazan? And I know that earnings stream there is a little lumpy. Is there any way to get some more clarity on the timing or outlook on these earnings?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Emily, first of all, good morning. The increase in our guidance is due to our confidence in the performance of our business in terms of volumes, especially in China. As Corning mentioned, we had a very good performance in Asia, better than we expected, and that is why we are \u2013 that's the principal reason we are increasing our guidance.","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And...","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay?","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. And then in terms of the consolidated volume growth of 8%, is there a way to break that down between the equipment sales and the new project startups?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","It is possible, but we don't plan to do it.","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Seifi, I wanted to ask, you were quite emphatic that you're more confident now deploying your capital. Can you give us the reason for that increased confidence?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Bob. Obviously, if I say that, that means that we are seeing more projects that we can work on. And as time goes by, we see more projects that we can work on. So, I'm sure you'll bear with me to kind of stay general, but we have always said that we see a lot of opportunities, but as we engage with customers and prospective customers, we are becoming more confident that we can actually do these things.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And Seifi, can I ask, is it conscientious on your part \u2013 I mean last quarter, you sounded much more cautious, you noted concerns about economic policy in the U.S., Brexit, geopolitical tension. And now this quarter, it seems like the volumes have popped nicely. The tone just sounds more upbeat. Is there something that's changed from your perspective, that gives you that greater confidence, or is this sort of in the macros, or is this still all idiosyncratic to your own business?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Hi, Bob. That's an excellent question. I have always been very optimistic about the performance of Air Products. The other comments that I made about the general consensus in the economy, I don't need to make any comments about that because now you see that as the headline of the paper. So, I don't want to be stating the obvious about what is going on in the U.S., its policies and the geopolitical condition. So we didn't feel it was necessary for us to stress that. As I said, you see that in the news.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. On your price and mix performance in Europe, it looks like you are basically doing okay in gaining the underlying price, but you're having some issues with recovering electric power costs. And I'm just wondering, is that something that typically has a lag, historically, or how would you expect that issue to progress going forward?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I'd like to refer that to Corning to answer. Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So, I'd just like to stress that on a real pricing basis, we see positive pricing. So, the mix impact is fairly powerful for us right now and there's two things behind that. So, on a product basis, we're selling a lot of CO2 right now, a year ago we had some production issues. It's the summer season, there's a lot going. CO2 is just a lower priced product and it's going to bring down that number. But the fact that I'm able to sell more is really a good thing for us.","The other thing that's playing out in the mix effect is just larger customers taking more product. We can deliver the product to large customers more efficiently, they command and get better pricing. So, that hits as well. In terms of overcoming all that and still hitting the power, I'd say we're about 50% through, recovering what we were aiming for, and I remain confident that we're going to follow on on this and we will get that back.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And on \u2013 I realize Seifi, it's a little bit early to talk about 2018, but given your sentiments on the global macro environment and geopolitical issues, do you see any reason to doubt that you could hit the 10% long-term EPS growth target in 2018?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I said several times during the call that we promised everybody four years ago that we will hit 10% EBITDA growth over the long term. We are still committed to that. And if the geopolitical conditions and the economic conditions become tougher, then we need to take actions in order to deliver the number. The 10% is non-negotiable. We are very committed to that.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I'd like to go back to the price issue. Your pricing on a global basis was flat and I think some of your competitors had prices up 1% to 2%. Is that difficulties in comparability or does it turn out you're not executing as well as you might in getting your prices up right now?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","When we report numbers for overall Air Products, there is significant amount of noise related to mix in terms of which part of the world, and then the pricing that we include includes our whole company, it's not just the merchant thing. Corning mentioned about different areas. We usually don't like to talk too much about pricing and all of that, but we are \u2013 I don't want to characterize it as if we are having difficulty in increasing prices. The prices in the market very much depends on the supply\/demand situation and we are part of that. I wouldn't want to characterize it the way you said that we would have any difficultly on that, but Corning, do you want to make any additional comments on that?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, I think also going to where Seifi was just saying, I think the aggregation, when you do that, you lose a lot of color of what's really happening, especially on a business that is so local. So maybe just to peel back the onion one step further, we showed flat pricing in the Americas. In truth, underlying that, we had actually positive pricing in North America, negative pricing in Latin America and that kind of offset, just to give you a sense of \u2013 a little more color.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","If I may follow up, in terms of the Jazan project, that's a base case, does the equipment piece conclude by mid 2019?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Something like that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","And we will take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, P.J. How are you doing?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. So, you had two write-downs in the quarter, can you explain those? The first one was in Latin America, probably in Indura assets, and then second one was in Saudi Arabia. And I know that you're trying to acquire more assets in the Middle East, but you mentioned current challenging conditions in Saudi Arabia. Does that change your strategy towards Middle Eastern acquisitions? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, P.J., thank you very much for asking the question, but there is a famous saying that the best time to buy is when things are not going well. So actually, the conditions are actually very favorable in buying things in the Middle East right now because of the oil prices being down. So I kind of actually see that as a favorable sign rather than a negative sign.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Is that okay?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So you think this is an opportunity to buy in Middle East?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes, that is correct.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, okay. And the second question on the backlog. Can you discuss the outlook for hydrogen or HyCO projects? Again, we go back to oil price and volatility there, refining margins are weak. What are you hearing in the HyCO projects?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, the thing is that the HyCO projects that we are focused on are \u2013 significant part of that is related to coal gasification, and the outlook for that is very positive. In terms of HyCO projects for other projects, there are not that many new projects, but as you know, we are focused on asset buybacks and we see opportunities there.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And lastly, can you just talk about the chemical opportunity on the U.S. Gulf Coast? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, there was a lot of excitement about a lot of new projects, but then the oil prices came down, although gas prices are down, a lot of those projects they're put on hold. And you know that better than anybody else. I mean you're very knowledgeable about what everybody was trying to do. So we are in the Gulf Coast, we will participate. Obviously, you saw that project that we just announced in Geismar and there are other projects that we are working on, but I'm not as optimistic there as I am in other parts of the world.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, P.J.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. On slide 16, on maintenance capital versus growth CapEx, Praxair this quarter started reporting something related to this, CapEx towards secured contracts versus non-contracted CapEx. So, congrats in the first place on driving this change here; I was skeptical at first. But my question is how comparable are the two presentations? They indicated merchant tanks and cylinders were a large part of their growth CapEx. But since you do larger projects and you don't have a U.S. cylinder business, is the majority of your growth \u2013 or the vast majority of growth CapEx your large projects?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, John, first of all, thank you for your comment. I do appreciate that. We have always thought very strongly that looking at distributable cash is the right way to look at the valuation of industrial gases, and we are very pleased to see that others are following that.","In terms of how they present their numbers and how we present, I quite honestly don't want to be making comments about what our competitors' financials are; I don't think that would be appropriate. We are very committed to the way we present the numbers and our numbers are very clear, detailed analysis and reflective of what we need to do to maintain our current EBITDA. That is the definition of maintenance CapEx that we have. That if everything stops, how much money do we need to invest in order to replace the assets that we have in order to maintain our current EBITDA. And that is our definition of maintenance CapEx.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, John.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Seifi, good volumes...","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, David. How are you doing?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thank you, very good. So very good volumes in North America, you mentioned refining, but overall, is there any acceleration in your business that you're seeing or just, again, refining and plus other is driving that very good volume growth in your business?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I don't want to characterize it as a significant acceleration of the business, but I think that we have our act together and we are trying to provide the service that our customers need in order to make sure that we get our fair share of \u2013 Corning, do you have any other comments?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","I'm sorry, is your question mainly at North America or globally?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","North America. Are you seeing any acceleration, North American activity?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. I would say North America was broad based for us and, by definition, being broad based, not like one particular thing or another. I'd say just hard work in sales activity across the board.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And, Corning, also on the maintenance costs in Q3, can you quantify the impact and what that tailwind might be heading to Q4?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, so I think we're not going for specific details on it, I'd say maybe just give a little bit of color for what we experienced in this quarter. There's a little bit more around some large air separation units that we worked on and they tend to have, in some ways, a broader impact, because there's product dislocation and making up the argon and that sort of thing. But that was the nature of a certain amount of the costs for North America this quarter.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, David.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. As a large shareholder yourself, how do you believe the Air Products story will continue to evolve from here outside of the solid op execution? Just in terms of where we stand, right here, right now, can you just talk about the various views on project backlog growth versus a year ago, what you're seeing in the merchant business and then the capital deployment opportunities? Just any color on what you believe the key two to three drivers of your story are right now. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Chris, that's an excellent question. And thanks for asking the question to give me the opportunity to talk about that. We have delivered on what we promised three years ago. So, obviously, the question from the investors is, okay, I've enjoyed the past, what are you going to do for me in the future? The key thing is that now, Air Products has margins of about 33% to 35%, the best in the industry. We have our act together, therefore, we will benefit as much as anybody else on any kind of economic activity and so on going forward.","But then in addition to that, the key thing is that we do have $8 billion to $10 billion of firing capacity and we do see opportunities to deploy that. Therefore, the story of Air Products for the future is deploying that capital. And if we do that, we will generate significant value for our shareholders. So that is what we are promising the investors and that is three years from now, hopefully, we will look back and say, yeah, we said we have $10 billion to deploy and we did deploy that at good returns, and that $10 billion will generate $1 billion of operating profit. That is our story going forward, and we have a lot of confidence in our ability to deploy that and deliver that.","And that's the key thing, while maintaining a first-class operation, getting the pricing, getting the volumes as anybody else will do. The differentiating thing for us versus other people is the fact that we have the balance sheet to go do these things. Okay?","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Can you just walk us through the Asian business a little bit more, parsing out a little more detail on the volume front, just anything you see in key end market trends, et cetera. And then also is there anything on the pricing front you'd be willing to discuss, whether it's regional nature, slightly favorable bulk operating rates, et cetera? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I would like to make some comments and turn it over to Corning. When you look at Asia, I mean, we reported 20% increase in sales. About half of that was related to some specific equipment sales that we had, the other half is genuine growth in our business. Some of that is coming up from the new plants we are bringing onstream, but a lot of that, as Corning mentioned before, is because we do \u2013 Chinese economy is growing, and most important the utilization is going up. I think Corning will mention, and I turn it over to him, that right now if you take Asia, the utilization of industrial gas business on the merchant side is getting close to 80%. That is a very good sign and that is usually an indication that the prices will strengthen. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Seifi. Yeah. So, for sure, right now, China is the strongest economy for us in Asia, that's where I think we see most of the positive momentum in terms of strong volume growth, pricing, and so forth. Within China, as Seifi mentioned, we've broken the line to just north of 80% on our loading. I'd like to point out, that is our loading. That is not industry loading. And I would put industry loading, my estimate more in, let's say, the 60% sort of range.","I would say a key thing about understanding our loading, not only is it now hitting the 80%, it is 80% with much higher retail sales than we had before, year-on-year, up like 5%, 500 basis points in terms of the proportion of the business that's retail. That helps us with pricing, that helps us with just the quality of the underlying basis.","I think the other thing just to keep in mind in China, we know a sort of tailwind we have before us right now is the government getting serious about reform in the steel industry, and that has the potential to take captive capacity off the market. And to be honest with you, that's a positive for us as well right now.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from the line of Stephen Byrne from Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Wanted to ask you about your sale of equipment business. Is that, as a fraction of your project backlog, likely to remain relatively stable, or could you see it going up as you pursue projects in regions that are more geopolitically challenged? Or could it possibly go down over time if there's little less aggressive offering of these services by your competitor in Germany? How do you see the outlook for that?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, our sale of equipment is not included in our backlog. We do not put that in our backlog. Our backlog is only sale of gas that would generate revenues for the longer term. Sale of equipment is a one-time thing, we don't consider that backlog. So...","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Pardon me...","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","...Those things are not included in our backlog, sir.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply the roster of projects. I meant as a business opportunity to pursue an opportunity where you sell the equipment versus build to own. That option that you have, is that driven primarily by customer demand, your preference or customer preference?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Our preference for sure, 100%, is sale of gas. We are not an equipment company to make money on sale of equipment. But considering the capabilities that we have, in order to maintain a relationship with the customer, if they insist on a sale of equipment, we do once in a while do that. But our focus and our preference has always been sale of gas, because that is our business.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And if there was less bidding activity on sale of equipment down the road, would you view that as constructive, maybe a greater opportunity for build to own?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","That is correct. That would be the case, yes.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just lastly on the Glenmont, New York facility, is that region in your merchant business tightening up, that would justify building a bigger liquid plant in that region? And why pursue that as a JV with Linde instead of go it alone?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, there was a tightening of the market and there is additional capacity required, and what made sense was that rather than us building another 300 or 400 ton-a-day plant to meet the requirements, it made sense to build a 1,200 ton-a-day plant, which is a lot more efficient, and at the end of the day, it's good for the customers because our cost base for both companies is lower and, therefore, the customers benefit. So that is actually a good thing for our customers and it also creates opportunity to produce the gas at a lower cost.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, this is Matthew on for Kevin. I don't want to kind of beat the equipment sales dead horse here, but kind of just trying to track it down a little bit. Would it be fair to say the equipment sales in Asia were about $45 million year-over-year? And kind of what does the EBIT margin look like on that business? I'm guessing it'd be higher than the segment average. And maybe you touched on this a little bit, but what should we expect in 4Q 2018 as far as new equipment sale order book?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","As I've told you, we are not focused on equipment sales, we don't consider that to be a significant part of our business, and I don't think you should expect too much on that. That is not what drives our business, that's not what we are focused. We are not like some other industrial gases business, where half of their business is equipment sale. That is not \u2013 that has never been our focus and it will not be. We are \u2013 that's not a big deal for us.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I get that. I'm just trying to kind of effectively strip it out of the numbers to maybe to get a better sense of what ongoing profitability will look like in the Asia segment. Just trying to make apples-to-apples basically.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We have tried to make sure that we do give you that visibility, because when we report Gases Americas or Gases Europe or Gases Asia, it doesn't have equipment sales in it because that is \u2013 it's all in Global Gases.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","So, maybe just one clarification to that. When we have, in this case, some gas handling equipment that is in the Asia segment, I don't think we're going to go into the exact quantification because it's a small group of customers and so forth. I will say it was a positive impact on our margins. But the nature of this was not something that's going to repeat every day. As Seifi says, I wouldn't be expecting that going forward.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","But there is a difference that we need to kind of make sure that the investors understand. One thing is sale of equipment in terms of selling an air separation unit. The other thing is that when we deal with, specifically, with our electronic customers. The electronic customer sometimes require equipment which is related to the delivery of gas and purifying of the gas. That we do do for our customers, we do that for our electronic customers, and that specific area did contribute some to our Asian results.","But your question was equipment sales on the major air separation units, and I said we are not focused on that. But for some of our electronic customers, as a matter of necessity, when we build them a nitrogen generator \u2013 high-purity nitrogen generator, there are equipment related to the delivery of that to the customer, we do provide those equipment, and those are in the category of equipment sale, but they are not air separation units.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. Nice quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I just wanted to ask on the LNG weakness, you said $0.30 for 2017 and despite the, I guess, the new plants that was in line. Should we be done with this headwind moving into 2018 or do you think there's still a little bit of a drag from it?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, obviously in that business, which was such a lumpy business, it's difficult to predict, but right now, if you wanted to be pessimistic, there might be another $0.04 or $0.05 hit to us in 2018 because of LNG.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. If I could just ask one...","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","That's the way it looks right now. Yeah.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And was there any way we could get you to break out the organic volume versus the new projects and everything else?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","For where, for...","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, regionally or globally, however you'd be willing to do it.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, organic volumes, most of the volumes that we reported was organic except in Asia, where we said that half of the 20% was equipment. So, Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, I think we said...","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, also, I guess, I'm trying to break out just sort of base business versus new project startups versus equipment sale, just the base business.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Understood, understood. So I think the main energy is around Asia, that's where we had the biggest impact on it. And if you're looking at that 20% we had, about half of that was the equipment, the other half was on our gas side, and I'd say roughly 50\/50 on that in terms of volume between new projects and just organic merchant growth.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, I mentioned that in my opening remarks, in the other question that out of that, as Corning said, about 10% is equipment that we do for electronic customers, the other 10%, half of it is new project startups and half of it is organic growth.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","So we had 5% organic growth.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Vincent.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. I have just two quick ones. First, do you expect over the next two, three years to get back to the pattern of EBITDA growth in each region, outpacing organic growth? And I think you've been pretty clear about the dynamics that have caused this quarter to have its characteristics. So just want to see if you expect those trends to reverse.","And secondly, just eyeballing the backlog, is it fair to put roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion worth of gases startups in terms of capital that's going to be ramping up in 2018 and a tailwind into 2019? Is that roughly a good bogey?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, first of all, with respect to the growth thing, I think we have always said that when you are looking at different regions of the world, in mature economies, our EBITDA will grow with economic development, and our volumes will grow with GDP.","In emerging markets it is \u2013 if industrial production is 2%, usually, gases grow more than that, about 1.2, 1.3 times that. So I expect our EBITDA growth in the growth markets like China and India would be better than that.","With respect to the other question that you had, Simon, do you want to make some comments on that?","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure. I think, Laurence was asking about the amount of the backlog we expect to come on in 2018. I think, Laurence, as usual, it's hard to know exactly when these projects are going to come onstream, so I think we'll give you more clarity on 2018 when we get to October.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Then we do our forecast for the year.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products\u2019 First Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I\u2019m pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders.","After our comments, we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. We issued our earnings release this morning. It\u2019s available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials.","As a reminder, we are discussing our results today under our new segment reporting structure which was in place as of October 1, 2014. On January 5, we provided two years of historical results under this new segment structure that information is also available on our website.","Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today\u2019s teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on this slide and at the end of today\u2019s earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations.","Now, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon. And good morning to everyone. Thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in our company. Before we get into the details, let me introduce our team who will be on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products\u2019 Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases. And Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products\u2019 Executive Vice President in charge of Material Technologies. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. I am pleased to report that thanks to the hard work and significant contributions of Air Products\u2019 more than 20,000 employees we delivered a strong performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.","As you will note, we have materially improved our safety record and increased our earnings per share for the quarter by 16% versus last year. We increased our EBITDA margin by 240 basis points and we are on our way to once again become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We do appreciate that we still have a long day to go to fulfill our stated goals, but the fact is we have started on our journey to get there.","Air Products is moving forward with the full force and support of all of our people. I am very proud of our entire team and their positive response to the most significant organizational and cultural change in our 75 year history. I am optimistic and excited about our future.","Now please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance for the first quarter is encouraging. We improved our lost-time injury rate by 42% and our recordable case rate by 52%. This is a clear indication that our people are actively involved in improving the discipline of operations and distribution and they are fully engaged in implementing our culture of safety, simplicity, speed and self-confidence.","When it comes to safety performance we do need to do better and we can do better. But the results indicate that we are moving in the right direction. Once again I would like to thank all of our people for their focus and contribution.","Now please turn to Slide #4. I want to remind everyone, once again, that our goal is and will continue to be a constant and persistent effort to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.","Now please turn to Slide #5. We have talked about our management principles before, but I want to emphasize our total focus on creating value for our shareholders, cash generation, capital allocation and moving toward a decentralized organization.","Now, please turn to Slide #6. In September of 2014, we laid out a detailed strategic plan to move forward. Let me give you a brief overview and update on where we are today on the five key points.","On point number one, it is now very clear to everyone that our core business is Industrial Gases and we are totally focused on improving and growing that business.","On point number two, I am very pleased to report that we have restructured the company and are operating under the new structure. As I said, this has been a significant amount of change in a short period of time designed to create a simple, empowered and accountable organization. We are now also reporting our results in accordance with the new structure and have also provided you with appropriate historical data.","On point number three, we are we are making progress in implementing our company culture of total focus on safety, simplicity, speed of execution, and collective self-confidence that we can be the best Industrial Gas company in the world. This will be a continuous effort in the months and years to come, but I can confidently report that our people are driving the change.","On point number four, we have put in place a very robust and vigorous process to review and allocate capital. We examine all projects over $3 million on a weekly basis with the full participation of our relevant executives.","On point number five, we have made significant changes to our compensation plans. The details are in our proxy statement. The key driver is to reward our people based on performance of their relevant area of responsibility, create differentiation in pay and encourage focus on EBITDA and cash generation.","Now please turn to Slide #7, our quarterly results. The numbers are self-explanatory and Scott will go through the details, but I want to make a few comments. First, that despite the significant organizational changes, our team has stayed focused on controlling costs, pushing productivity, and have delivered a 240 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin. Second, we did deliver a 16% improvement in earnings per share despite a $0.05 headwind due to currency.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details and then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks and answer your questions. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco","Thank you, Seifi. Now, please turn to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our Q1 results. After ending FY 2014 with solid performance in Q4, we again delivered improved results to begin FY 2015 on a strong note. Sales of $2.6 billion increased 1%, a strong underlying growth of 5% was partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 3%, and a 1% impact from our decision to exit the PUI business.","Volumes increased 4%, primarily from strength in three areas. In North America Gases we delivered broadly higher volumes across most businesses. This included strong hydrogen demand, particularly from our US Gulf Coast customers. In Gases Asia, volume growth was driven primarily by new plant startups in China. And in Materials Technologies we again saw solid growth across all businesses.","Pricing was 1% higher, driven by broad-based price increases across Gases Americas. We delivered operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA improved by 10% and operating income improved by 15% on the 1% sales growth. EBITDA margin improved to 28.2% while our operating margin improved to 17.4%, both up more than 200 basis points versus prior year.","Sequentially, our profits and margins were down slightly as we saw lower seasonal sales in North America Gases and Materials Technologies. Overall, costs were flat with operational improvements offset by higher incentive comp. As a reminder, in Q4, we had lower incentive compensation costs across all the segments as a result of our final 2014 year-end payout. Versus prior year, net income increased 17% and earnings per share grew by 16%.","Our fourth quarter trailing return on capital employed increased by 20 basis points to 10.1%. This is the first year-over-year improvement in some time. Our Q1 ROCE of 10.6% improved 140 basis points over last year. You can see this in the appendix slide. Both improvements are a result of better operating performance and costs focus.","You\u2019ve heard us talk quite a bit about our focus on cash. And we have said that we don\u2019t want to be in a position to be borrowing money to pay dividends. This is consistent with the way we are focusing and running the business. Driven by a strong fourth quarter we were breakeven on this free cash flow metric in fiscal year 2014, a significant improvement over fiscal year 2013.","As you can see in our first quarter 2015, we generated higher EBITDA, but this improvement was more than offset by increases in capital expenditures, cash taxes and dividends. It is not unusual for these items to move around quarter-to-quarter.","For the remainder of fiscal 2015, we expect to continue delivering higher EBITDA due to our cost reduction efforts and our capital expenditures should decline in the second half of the year as we bring on-stream more projects from our backlog. We are certainly working towards being free cash flow positive for fiscal year 2015.","Turning to Slide 10, you can see an overview of the factors that drove this quarter\u2019s performance in terms of earnings per share.","Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance I\u2019d like to spend a moment reviewing two non-GAAP items that total $0.05. First, our restructuring charges totaling $32 million or $0.10 per share as a result of our decision to realign the organization. As I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we expect to see restructuring costs and pension settlement costs in FY 2015 as we continue to simplify the organization and reduce costs. Also we acquired our partner\u2019s share of a small industrial gas production joint venture.","The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. And as a result of revaluating our previously held equity interest to fair value, the quarter includes a gain of $18 million pre-tax or $0.05 per share. Excluding these items our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $0.55 increased $0.21 or 16% versus last year. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.18. Pricing, energy and raw materials, taken together, contributed $0.04. Net cost performance was $0.08 favorable, as we are seeing the benefits of our focus on costs more than offsetting fixed costs inflation.","The impact of the PUI business exit was $0.04. Unfavorable currency translations were $0.05 as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. Equity affiliate income was $0.02 higher on better costs performance and higher volumes in Asia.","Interest expense was lower but offset by higher non-controlling interests. Our tax rate of 24% remained unchanged versus prior year. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning Painter","Thanks, Scott. Before I review our regional results, I want to make a few overall comments on industrial gases. We\u2019ve restructured and simplified our business along three principles. First, combining all of our gases businesses; second, consolidating key activities such as operations and distribution within the business; and third, running the business regionally. In doing so we\u2019ve driven true P&L ownership meaning decision making regarding customers, plans, distribution, all of that, is now with our local managers making us more agile, responsive, and cost competitive.","As you can imagine, adopting a simpler and less matrixed organization with greater empowerment and accountability is popular. It is something that many employees have been looking forward to.","I would like to thank our people, for staying focused on safety, our customers, and delivering today\u2019s results during these exciting times at Air Products.","During the same timeframe, since the beginning of our fiscal year the price of oil has dropped essentially in half, obviously that\u2019s a huge change. But it had no discernible impact on our industrial gas business in Q1. Our hydrogen volumes remain strong as did our US Oil Field Services business. Being agile and focused on cost is always important and even more or so in times like this. Our restructuring advances both of those traits and it is well underway.","Finally, a comment on helium, as we mentioned last quarter new supply has come into the market, improving the supply-demand balance, while also impacting the industry\u2019s cost structure. At this point, any pent-up demand from years of shortage has been met. Looking forward we are focused on managing price, cost, and volumes, but we do not see helium as material upside in the near future.","With that, please turn to Slide 11 for a review of our Gases Americas results. We delivered strong results this quarter with broad volume growth in North America and strong pricing. Latin America market was weak in comparison. We kept a very tight focus on cost and have taken actions throughout the region, which will begin to hit the bottom line in Q2.","Sales of just over $1 billion were up 6% versus last year. Volumes were up 4% with liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon volumes up mid-teen digits in North America on strength across our customer base - I\u2019m sorry, mid-single digits in North America.","Hydrogen volumes were up significantly over last year, as we continue to see strong demand from refinery customers on the US Gulf Cost, and we had fewer planned maintenance outages.","South American volumes were flat with last year. Pricing was also strong up 3% versus prior year with good results across all of the liquid bulk products in North America, and more inflation driven increases in Latin America. Higher energy prices added 2% to sales, while currency reduced sales by 3%, primarily from the translational effect of the Chilean peso moving about 14% and the Canadian dollar down 8%.","Underlying sales were down 1% sequentially, primarily due to seasonality in North America versus last year EBITDA grew 8%, increasing EBITDA margin to 33.1%, the highest in the last two years.","Operating income grew by 14% as we saw good leverage on the volume increases. We did see lower maintenance costs, but this was more than offset by a prior year equipment sale gain. We saw a positive effect of continued focus on cost, and we expect the benefits of the reorganization to start to ramp-up in Q2. Sequentially profits were down on lower volumes and lower incentive compensation costs in Q4.","Now, please turn to Slide 12, for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region our results were essentially flat compared to last year before the impact of currency. It\u2019s always important to manage costs, particularly so in today\u2019s soft economic environment. Our restructuring is well-timed.","The new organization structure is in place and a number of actions are underway, we will deliver these savings to our bottom line over the course of the year. Underlying sales were flat versus last year, with lower energy pass through reduced sales by 2% and currency negatively impacted sales by 7%, primarily the euro, the British pound, and the Polish zloty.","Liquid bulk volumes were positive, while cylinder volumes were negative, reflecting a general trend of larger customers showing greater strength than our smaller ones. Underlying sales were flat sequentially.","Operating income of $81 million and EBITDA of $143 million were both down 5% versus last year, but again, would have been slightly positive without the currency impact. Sequential profits were increased or were impacted by currency, higher power costs, and lower Q4 incentive compensation costs.","Please turn to Slide 13. Asia Gases delivered a strong quarter having brought new plants on stream and controlling costs. As we have said, our large onsite customers may experience some delays in bringing their projects on stream. But the core message here is, we are executing our projects on budget. Our customers are progressing their projects, start-ups are happening, plants are running, and we are getting paid.","Underlying sales were up 5% versus last year, as volumes were up 6%, primarily on the new plants particularly the large PCEC project. We continue to see price pressure in the China liquid market, although we have somewhat mitigated that by improving our whole sale retail mix. It has been more than two years since Air Products decided to add liquid capacity in China, but we still see new capacity coming into the marketplace. The sequential sales increase was also primarily driven by the new plants.","EBITDA of $155 million was up 12% to 38.8% margin. And the operating income was up 9% to 22.7% margin. Obviously, the volume growth from the new plants brings additional costs, but we are still seeing strong leverage. The sequential profit increase was driven by the new plant start-ups, partially offset by lower Q4 compensation.","I\u2019ll close with a few words on the Global Gases segment. This segment consists of most of our air separation unit, sale of equipment business and the associated service. These businesses naturally generate sales and profits. This segment also includes costs associated with industrial gas business, which are not region specific. So for example, R&D, product development, management costs, costs which we can leverage globally are in this segment. I am accountable for those costs and by not allocating them I can hold the regional managers accountable for what they directly control. And that\u2019s an example of our new philosophy.","In terms of results for this quarter, our sales were down versus last year on lower product - project activity. And we\u2019ll see that sort of variation in this segment. Excluding a favorable inventory revaluation last year, our profits would have been relatively flat.","Our non-business costs were flat versus last year and down slightly sequentially. Now I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.","Guillermo Novo","Thanks, Corning. Please turn to Slide 14. The Materials Technologies segment delivered another very strong quarter including record safety performance driven by good top line growth and significant leverage to the bottom line with higher volumes and very tight cost focus. The new organization is in place and delivering on its commitments. We have taken action on our restructuring plans and will start seeing benefits from lower costs in the coming quarter. The team is excited to have full and direct control over all the key elements of their business performance including operations and supply chain.","Electronic Materials sales were up 13% versus prior year as we have seen increased demand across all three businesses. Higher demand in process materials was driven by significant growth in the memory market. We are leveraging tighter markets to secure long-term volume commitments and drive pricing. We expect to begin to see pricing benefits next quarter. Advanced Materials continues to grow as customers ramp production of their next generation nodes.","And finally, Delivery Systems\u2019 business activities remains at a high level, although we will likely see it drop off later in fiscal year 2015. Performance Materials grew 6% as strong growth across all the businesses more than offset the negative currency impact. Most of our segment currency impact was in Performance Materials business.","End market demand remains strong and we are additionally benefiting from share gain and successful new product introduction. Sequential volumes were down 6% on typical materials seasonality and strong prior quarter equipment business in Electronics.","Versus last year, EBITDA of $129 million was up 45% to a 24.7% margin and operating income of $105 million was up 63% to a 20% margin. Strong operating leverage on the volume increases, productivity, continued tight cost focus and negative prior year inventory revaluation drove the increase. Profits were down sequentially on lower volumes and lower Q4 incentive compensation costs.","Now I will turn over the call to Simon.","Simon Moore","Thanks, Guillermo. I will make a few comments on our other two segments. First, our Corporate segment. Just to clarify, this segment consists of our LNG and helium container manufacturing businesses. For Q1 of last year, this segment also included our PUI business which we exited in December 2013.","This segment also includes our corporate costs, which are not business specific. Examples include Seifi\u2019s costs, Scott\u2019s costs and other corporate functions. As we have said before, we no longer allocate general corporate costs to our business units. In terms of results for this quarter, our sales are flat versus last year excluding the PUI business.","In Q1 of last year the PUI business had about $35 million of sales and contributed about $0.04 of EPS. This year LNG sales were up and helium container sales were down. Our LNG projects continue as expected and we have not yet seen any sign of a slowdown in development activity, although we will be watching this very carefully.","In fact, just yesterday we announced a new order to provide LNG technology and equipment to the Cameron LNG project in Louisiana. This represents our third large order for the US LNG export market. Excluding PUI segment profits improved as business profits were up and corporate costs were down.","The other segment is Energy-from-Waste. The Tees Valley Projects continue as expected. For Tees Valley 1, we have already begun commissioning a few of the systems and we expect to be in start-up mode through the rest of 2015, so do not expect any revenue or earnings in 2015 in this segment.","In short, no change to what we have told you before. We do see a small ongoing reported loss associated with the land lease and commercial management of this segment.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thanks again, Simon. Now please turn to Slide number 15, for a discussion of our outlook. At this point in time, based on what we know today, our guidance for the next quarter is $1.50 to $1.55 per share. At midpoint this will be an increase of 16% over the previous year.","As for all of fiscal year 2015, we are slightly increasing our guidance to $6.35 to $6.55 per share. At midpoint this represents a 12% increase over our 2014 results. All of the numbers that I just quoted are in actual exchange rates. We are not going to use currency changes as an excuse to reduce our targets.","As for capital expenditure in 2015, we expect $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion which is in line with what we have told you before. We continue to enjoy a very robust backlog with a high level of secure on-site pipeline projects. The backlog of $3.2 billion is down from $3.5 billion last quarter as we are very pleased to have one of our major projects in China successfully on the stream.","As you have heard me say before, we are totally focused on actions that we can control to deliver on our commitments. The new organization is in place. We are executing on our improvement actions and our teams are working together to achieve our goals. Our new structure enables us to reduce overhead costs, which we have continued to improve cash flow and earnings in 2015.","In addition, our new organization and our new reward system allows us to be more effective in improving performance of our existing assets and businesses with a laser focus on cost reduction, utilization, and asset management. I once again want to thank all of the very talented, committed, and dedicated people, and Air Products for their contribution and I continue to be optimistic about the future of Air Products and our ability to deliver excellent results.","Now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","Q - John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Good morning, John. How are you this morning?","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Great, great, thank you. So a question. With regard to the margin improvements, you\u2019ve gotten 240 basis points of improvement year-over-year. And I guess, and listening to some of Corning\u2019s comments, it sounds like a lot of the cost-cutting initiatives haven\u2019t really started to kick in all that much yet and it\u2019s more - those are more on the come as we kind of look forward. So I guess of the margin improvement that we saw so far on the year to - year-over-year improvement, how much would you say is tied to cost-cutting and efficiency programs versus just volume and pricing coming in and kind of what you would have expected normally anyway?","Seifollah Ghasemi","I would say, it\u2019s about half and half.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just with regard to the targets that you are thinking about for 2015 in terms of some of the cost-cutting levers that you expect, I know, originally you had said, look, to close the gap to be the best, we need kind of 600 basis points to 700 basis points of margin improvement. How much do you think you get in 2015 based on the cost-cutting initiatives you\u2019ve already put in place?","Seifollah Ghasemi","John, you know you are asking obviously a very good question. But you know that I\u2019m going to dance around in giving you a timing. We have said that, our goal is to close the 600 basis points of gap in EBITDA margin that we have with the best performing in the industry.","We demonstrated that we are making progress, 240 basis points is a significant step forward in one quarter. And we will continue working at this thing as fast as we can. There is a lot of other things that can happen in terms of the worldwide economy and all of that. But we are focused on closing the gap as soon as we possibly can, John.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks very much for the color, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you, sir.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good morning, fellas.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Good morning, Duffy.","Michael Scott Crocco","Hi, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer","A question around the comment you made on FX, Seifi. Where you said actual exchange rates, it sounds like what you are saying is come hell or high water you are going to deliver those numbers, no matter what currency does. But can you talk about what type of headwinds you are having to overcome at, say, the midpoint of that number for this year?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Duffy, yes, you are very right in characterizing my comment. The second thing is that overall the headwind for us for fiscal year 2015, where the exchange rates are right now versus 2014 is a $0.25 headwind. That means that if exchange rates were the same as they were in 2014, our guidance would have been $0.25 higher than what we have given you. That\u2019s the order of magnitude of the headwind that we are talking about.","Duffy Fischer","Okay, thanks.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you.","Duffy Fischer","And then, Corning, a question for you on the oil comment you made where you didn\u2019t see really any effect in Q1. Going forward, would you expect that to change? Do you see some puts and takes if oil stays at this lower level over the next year?","Michael Scott Crocco","Corning, you want?","Corning F. Painter","So I think at this point we would say, if you look at what exactly impacts us in oil, let me just kind of put this in perspective. So let\u2019s say exploration and production, what\u2019s our sales into that area? It is nitrogen for Oil Field Services and in Guillermo\u2019s area some chemicals that go into the fracking mixes just to span it, it\u2019s about $35 million of nitrogen we sell into Oil Field Services, it\u2019s like an $8 billion business, and it\u2019s even less in Performance Materials. Now, obviously if there is a big change, it can impact project timing and all of that. But for right now, we\u2019ve fully anticipated that in the guidance we\u2019ve given you.","Duffy Fischer","Great, thanks, fellas.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you.","Corning F. Painter","Thanks, Duffy.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Good morning, David. How are you, David?","David Begleiter","Very good. Thank you. Very good. Seifi, you mentioned again that your core business is Industrial Gases. Any further thoughts or update on what that means for Materials Technologies long-term in the portfolio?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, we told you that we are not in a hurry to do anything, because I thought, I mentioned this at our July call, that I said that these guys are going to really perform. And Guillermo is helping me prove me right by performing. I mean, look at the improvement that that business has enjoyed in the last two quarters. My God, their EBITDA margins are now 25%, their EBIT margin is around 20%.","So we are going to watch that business improve and then, everybody understands what their long-term plan is, but we are not in a hurry to do anything. They are doing a great job and who knows, if they get their EBITDA margins to 32%, 33%, and their EBIT margins to more than 25%, they might suddenly become a core business.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just on pricing, Seifi, can you talk about the success of your recent price increase, as well as the overall industry pricing environment?","Seifollah Ghasemi","David, I\u2019m with - I\u2019m not going to make any comments about pricing, David. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for us to engage in that kind of a conversation. I apologize for that. My lawyer is kind of - he\u2019s very conscious that we should not say anything about pricing.","David Begleiter","Understood. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks very much. There was a comment made at one point in the presentation about how your larger customers were doing better than your smaller customers. I wonder if you could just expand on, I think it was specific to a particular region. I wonder if you could just expand on that dynamic and just help us understand what that is and why that might be?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Very good question, Vincent. I think I will have Corning address that, please. Corning?","Corning Painter","Vincent, that\u2019s more or less an empirical observation of what\u2019s going on in the ground in Europe for us right now. Personally, I think, the larger customers just simply have broader exposure to broader markets, including export markets, where the smaller ones tend to be more local. And I see that as probably what\u2019s driving it.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And maybe just as a follow up. Could you just walk us through sort of where merchant utilization rates are in the various geographies and what your sort of outlook is there?","Corning Painter","Okay, yes. Merchant rates are very close to where they were as last time we reported. So that means in North America we are, let\u2019s say, in the high 70s, mid 70s in Latin America, Europe in the high 70s. Asia, I would say is now mid to high 70s, so that\u2019s just slightly down from where we were last time and in part that\u2019s, because with this new on-stream we just brought on some new capacity. And in addition to that, as we rebalance our wholesale\/retail, we\u2019ve shed some of the wholesale business.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust, Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan","Good morning, Seifi. Just with respect to the FX headwind that you mentioned $0.25, and you said that your EPS targets would have been $0.25 higher. Could you just comment a little bit about what you have done to offset that headwind?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Jim, what we have done is everything that we are doing. I mean, I have always said that for us to do what we need to do at Air Products is not the one magic wand, it\u2019s about 10,000 different things that we need to do right. And that is what we are focused on, the whole organization change, the whole focus on every single dollar that we have spent, the organization being rewarded based on specific areas of performance where people have line of sight. It\u2019s just - I can just go through a list of about 500 items that we are doing. Everybody - the great thing is that we have all of our 20,000 people engaged. This is not a one-person job or 10-person job, we need to get all of the organization engaged.","I\u2019m very encouraged, because when I look at the safety result and I see a 50% improvement that means our people are paying attention and they are involved. So we have to do many, many, many, many things that we would have done. I mean, whatever the exchange rates would have been, obviously, we would have wanted to have a guidance of $6.80. I mean, that\u2019s what we are working toward. And the currencies are going to be what the currencies are. But I don\u2019t think we should use that as an excuse and say, well, now let\u2019s lower the guidance. We have said, we are going to do something and we are going after that.","James Sheehan","Great, and also one for Scott, thanks for the guidance on 2015 free cash flow outlook. I was just wondering if you could also comment a little bit about how that looks further out, say, in 2016.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco","Thanks, Seifi. So, yes, thanks for the question. So as Seifi has mentioned, we are looking at maximizing the cash flow out of our existing assets driving EBITDA increases. And now we have an organization that is accountable and have all the levers all the way through that incentive compensation targets.","So the main thing we are looking to do is drive cash flow from the assets we have. We don\u2019t, excuse me, we don\u2019t have a target in terms of capital spending, we\u2019re going to look at what the opportunities are that are out there. As Seifi had mentioned, every project greater than $3 million comes to him for his review. And I will tell you, the review and the discussion is around why is this consistent with our strategy? What\u2019s the external market, what\u2019s the competitive position, and how do we get a good investment for the risk and create value for the shareholder?","So a little bit more background. We do not - we are obviously working, as I mentioned, trying to get to free cash flow positive for this year and looking forward to driving that even more in the future. So don\u2019t have a target per se, but just telling you what we are focused on and how we are managing the business.","James Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wei Zhang","Hi, this is Wei Zhang calling for Kevin. I just had a quick question on EMEA. So the sales decline seemed to be primarily from FX. Do you expect to see any impact on - from lower volumes basically due to the macro condition over there?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Corning, do you like to handle that?","Corning Painter","So, I think a key thing in our strategy right now is to do the right things, to do the 10,000 small things that Seifi talked to get our cost position right, to get the restructuring. And the overall economic environment, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve got any greater insight than you do other than our most recent results. So I want to be prepared for volume moving up or down. I don\u2019t think anybody sees a huge upswing in the offing. But our goal is just to be ready for whatever eventuality plays out.","Wei Zhang","Great, thanks. And just a follow up, if I may. Do you see any cost relief from FX in terms of capital spending for fiscal year 2015?","Corning Painter","So an impact on our capital costs based on the currency shifting, is that the question?","Wei Zhang","Yes, CapEx.","Corning Painter","Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco","Yes, let me comment on that. So first of all, obviously we are not in the business of trying to project out where currency and exchange rates are going to go. What we do is make sure that when we\u2019ve got a project that has difference in terms of revenues and some equipment that\u2019s coming from a different currency, we are going to hedge from a cash flow perspective, we are not going to hedge from an earnings perspective.","So in our latest guidance at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, obviously we\u2019ve looked at where the currencies are. Frankly, we\u2019ve got a lot of investment going in in China, we\u2019ve got a lot of investment in the UK. The RMB and the pound haven\u2019t moved that much. And so, our guidance continues to be $1.7 billion to be $1.9 billion. But, again, the key point here is the translation is going to be whatever the translation is going to be. What we are focused on is generating cash for the shareholder. And to the extent that there is any cash exposure, we\u2019ll hedge that for a project, but we don\u2019t - we are not going to have the - hedge the earnings.","Wei Zhang","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi, good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Good morning, Jeff. How are you doing?","Jeff Zekauskas","I\u2019m very fine. The - in the cash flow statement, your cash flows year-over-year were down about 11%, even though your earnings were up 12%. And I think your - I think your guidance for the year or your talk for the year is that, you wish to be free cash flow positive. Just being free cash flow positive is not really very much growth in operating cash flow. Was there something unusual that happened in the first quarter? And in general, what kind of growth are you expecting from your cash from operations this year?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Very good question. Scott is going to answer that.","Michael Scott Crocco","Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. Good question. So again as I mentioned, and Seifi has been very clear around the simplified cash flow metric. It is very straightforward, it is clear, where it\u2019s consistent between the internal organization, all the way to the outside. And again, as has been mentioned, there is EBITDA targets down through the organization. Clearly, though, then there is some of us at Air Products that are managing the full cash flow beyond the simplified approach.","So examples that we saw in this quarter, for example, were pension contributions, about $76 million of pension contributions. We had some cash associated with the severance actions we are taking, and we also had a little bit in terms of the earnings that we recognized from our affiliates versus the timing that we received those dividends.","So we are managing that, as well as receivables and so on and so forth. We are trying to make sure that we are optimizing all of that, but recognize again the simplified free cash flow mechanism is just that, it\u2019s clear, it\u2019s simple, and it\u2019s got alignment between inside the organization and outside.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And then for my follow-up. Last year in the first quarter, there were large maintenance expenses, especially in the United States, and there were some outage issues. What was the change in maintenance costs year-over-year in the first quarter?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Corning will answer that, Jeff, because it\u2019s mainly in industrial gases.","Corning Painter","Yes. So I don\u2019t know that I have the number fluid for you in the second, but I just want to clarify. So these are maintenance outages by and large which a large refinery will schedule oftentimes years in advance, and then during that outage when they don\u2019t need the product, we and other suppliers all do our outages. So we can follow up with you on what the exact swing was quarter from quarter and we did see a drop off in that. It was offset by a sale of equipment. And I\u2019m being coached here it\u2019s about a $0.01 impact that gave us in the first quarter.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Jeff, just to emphasize that\u2026","Jeff Zekauskas","Sure.","Seifollah Ghasemi","\u2026the difference in maintenance cost translates into $0.01 in earnings per share. So out of the $0.21 increase, $0.01 was lower maintenance costs.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David Manthey","Yes, hi, good morning. The 3% year-on-year price increase in North America seems really very high, just given that I assume that\u2019s concentrated in Merchant Gas. And I\u2019m wondering can you give us some color on how you\u2019ve been able to drive that kind of improvement and with volumes remaining as strong as they have, were you that far below market on big percentages of your business, or what\u2019s going on there? I know the market is strong right now, but that seems like a very high number.","Seifollah Ghasemi","I think, Corning, first - I mean, before Corning answers the question, it is the result of having high-quality focused management, but Corning?","Corning Painter","First, I just like to thank you for asking me this question, because although Seifi doesn\u2019t want to talk about pricing in this call, let me assure you when I\u2019m alone with him, there is a lot of questions about how I\u2019m doing on pricing. So I would say it\u2019s a reflection in some degree with supply and demand and increased loading in the market, as well as just a lot of discipline and using tools and so forth to go out and get the pricing that we are entitled to in this market. We give our customers good service and we are entitled to our pricing.","David Manthey","Okay, so it\u2019s just blocking and tackling, looks good though. Congratulations, it\u2019s a good number.","Corning Painter","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you for your comment. We very much appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll go next to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Hey, P.J., how are you today?","P.J. Juvekar","Good, good. Seifi, you had talked about increasing asset density as one of the key reasons for going to a regional structure. Can you tell us on that, where do you stand on that? How do we measure the performance of that from outside?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, quite frankly, I think, one of the measures would be to see how we are doing in terms of pricing and volumes. I mean that - if you have that kind of a stuff that you will be able to get the kind of numbers we are talking about in terms of pricing. But we have not, P.J., as you know, in the last two quarters done anything dramatic in terms of buying somebody or building an asset or anything like that. So we haven\u2019t done that. We certainly look for opportunities to be able to do that. But improvements in the result is not any significant structural change, it\u2019s just the blocking and tackling that Corning was talking about before.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you. And then secondly, a few companies have talked about delays in coal gasification, secure projects, I think Corning mentioned that. So what are you seeing in the backlog in terms of any potential delays either due to the oil price or slow China growth, et cetera?","Seifollah Ghasemi","On that one I can say that on the existing projects that we have and their execution, we are not seeing, and we don\u2019t expect to see any change or any cancellations due to lower oil prices. Those projects are solid. They are under construction, and we don\u2019t have any indication of anything happening to that. As far as any prospective future ones, P.J., we just have to wait and see. It\u2019s difficult to make predictions about that.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you, sir.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Thank you. Do you have a raw material index for the Materials segment and some indication of where raw materials are entering the March quarter versus where they were a year ago?","Seifollah Ghasemi","I will have Guillermo answer that, because raw materials are really only relevant in his business. Fortunately, raw material for the rest of our business is air and natural gas, which seems to be at very low prices these days.","John Roberts","Correct, I was just asking about Materials.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Yes. Thank you, sir.","Guillermo Novo","If you look at our portfolio Electronics and Performance Materials, first in Electronics, probably we are not seeing - the oil impact, that kind of thing is not a big impact on our raw materials. We are seeing some changes, but it\u2019s really around some of the supply\/demand dynamics on metals and other materials that we use on different parts of our products. And the material component is an important factor, but costs - the conversion costs, the shipping, the whole supply chain is very complex, so there is a lot of different drivers in Electronics.","So the bigger raw material purchase is really more on our Performance Materials business. We are seeing some changes there. Most of raw materials are not - I mean oil, ethylene, propylene in some products have some impact, but we are seeing, it\u2019s not the biggest driver for the types of raw materials that we are driving. So again, supply and demand dynamics and some raw materials are really driving where our costs are going. So we will probably see some cost reductions, but not as much as we expected. A good example of that would be for example EO, the ethylene prices are coming down, but that material, the tightness is really dictating the price. So we should get some improvement, but it\u2019s going to vary a lot by business.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs","Bob Koort","Thanks for me come in. Two questions if I might. Seifi, you\u2019ve taken a pretty, I guess, low-key approach to some of the head count reduction in terms of sizing it and how fast and how furious. But it seems like you\u2019ve maybe reduced head count by about 500 so far. Can you talk about what the anticipated benefit from that would be, and then any anticipated additional moves that would be forthcoming?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, Bob. First of all we would have waited until you asked a question anyway. We wouldn\u2019t have ended the call without your question. So just - I just wanted to make sure you know that. In terms of 500 people, that\u2019s kind of the number that is in the footnotes. Order of magnitude what saving that would result to is order of magnitude about $50 million to $60 million.","Bob Koort","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi","On an annual basis.","Bob Koort","Right. And, Guillermo, I\u2019m wondering in your business, the EBITDA margins obviously have moved up quite prominently. How does the return on capital in your business compare to the Gases business?","Guillermo Novo","Well, thanks, it\u2019s a very good question. I would say, hopefully, we\u2019ll get a little bit - give a little bit more of a glimpse of that at our coming investor conference, so that you can see a little bit of the feel. In general, we are less capital intensive and our returns are, versus our peers and versus gases, I would say higher and doing very well. And that\u2019s really what we look at. If you look at our improvement to be non-dilutive to the company EBITDA is our target. But to get there, really for us, it\u2019s about our operating margins, because our depreciation doesn\u2019t change that much and our returns on the investments that we make.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Bob, we will try to do a good job delineating that at our Investor Day. But for sure the return on capital is significantly higher, obviously.","Bob Koort","Yes, it certainly makes it seem like it will be a hard decision to not embrace them as part of the portfolio if these trends continue.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, you are asking the question and Guillermo is smiling. So he is happy for your comments.","Bob Koort","Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you very much.","Guillermo Novo","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Good morning, Mike. How are you?","Michael Scott Crocco","Hello, Mike.","Mike Harrison","Doing well, thank you. Guillermo, you mentioned that on the Process Materials side you expect pricing to start improving in the rest of the year. I believe that\u2019s an improvement from what has been some historical pressure on pricing. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving your more positive outlook there?","Guillermo Novo","Great. Well, thank you for that question. Let me sort of use this opportunity to point out two things. One, as you said, this is the segment that traditionally has been underperforming for us and the industry has over invested, if you look at the photovoltaic history, and if you look at our - a lot of the efforts that we put in the last two years, it\u2019s really been about improving this business. We\u2019ve shutdown production, right sized our capacity, shifted more of our supply to Asia, where we have most of our business.","So we are in a much better cost competitive position to supply - profitably supply the industry and that\u2019s driven the improvement. But if you look at the pricing trends because of the oversupply, supply\/demand balance, it\u2019s been pretty negative over time. What we are seeing is just things are turning around, especially driven by memory, a few key raw materials have really jumped and that\u2019s really driving the supply\/demand balance in a very different direction.","So we are fortunate that we\u2019ve done the right things and we are well-positioned to take advantage of this from a cost perspective. But more importantly now we are engaging our customers to make sure that not only we supply them today and that\u2019s the supply\/demand is dictating some of the pricing, but also talking about volumes as we look at debottlenecking and adding capacity in the future.","We want to learn from the history and this is an important area for win-win for our customers. They require reliability of supply they want to know, they are going to have the material for their needs in the coming years. So we want to make sure that we are reliable with them. But at the same time, we want to learn from some of the dynamics from the past and be very judicious on how we add capacity so that they get reliability, but we also get the returns that we expect on any investments we make.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then just looking at North American tonnage business, I was hoping that you could maybe discuss your expectations for outage activity for your refiners in the rest of the year, particularly as we see gasoline inventories creep quite a bit higher in the US.","Guillermo Novo","Yes, so our current forecast anticipates the outages. I think we have given guidance in general we expect this to be a lower year than last year. Last year was a bit of an anomaly. I guess the thing I would like to stress in this is, these are big outages and they are timed when the customer is already planning to take their units down. So I don\u2019t think there is any changes from any of our customers in a significant way changing around outage plans based on the shift in oil prices right now.","Mike Harrison","Thanks very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our final question from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","Thank you. Thank you. A couple questions, one on volume. What you used to refer to as Merchant looks like it was relatively flat as operating rates were flattish. So of your growth in tonnage, how much of it was from new projects versus how much of it was just increased demand for Hico? And as we look forward to the rest of the year what\u2019s the contribution from new projects whether you want to quantify it in either a volume or revenue or earnings per share framework?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thanks, Don. Good to hear from you. Corning will address that.","Corning Painter","So, Don, I think you are referring mainly to America\u2019s when you say that?","Don Carson","Yes.","Corning Painter","Okay. So actually we had volume growth in this quarter in liquid\/bulk across all the different products and they were up, let\u2019s say, mid-single-digit. So there was something positive there. We did see good volume growth in this quarter in the Gulf Coast. A fair amount of that is customers who are seeking additional hydrogen beyond which they\u2019ve necessarily contracted for, that gives us a certain amount of the uplift. As we go through the year, as is always the case any on-streams we have are listed later on in the slide deck. But I think the - let me see how to say this, any forecasts, any issues we have on that are sort of encompassed in our current set of numbers that we\u2019ve given you. Does that answer your question? There is no - there is no like the big project coming on in the Gulf Coast the duration of this year if that\u2019s what you are asking?","Don Carson","Okay. But and then globally, I mean, you used to talk about almost a $0.30 number in terms of EPS contribution for new projects. Is the kind of still what you are thinking of in terms of contribution this year?","Corning Painter","Yes. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given out specific numbers on what we expect new projects coming in. You\u2019ve seen the impact of PCEC that was a partial month, we\u2019ll see more of that as we go forward and we have other start-ups coming.","Don Carson","Okay. And, Seifi, just one follow-up on restructuring. Obviously, it\u2019s going a little faster than expected. I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about a $600 million EBITDA benefit from restructuring with half kind of SG&A and half sort of production and distribution efficiencies. Is everything we are seeing today from sort of these overhead cuts, or are you starting to see some efficiencies in the business as well?","Seifollah Ghasemi","We are seeing some, because if you look at our direct margins in terms of before overheads and all of that, the direct margins are up too. So we are seeing some improvements in operations and distribution, but they are not material right now. But I think you will see a lot of that as our organization kind of gets settled down, as our people in the regions and sub-regions get their hands on the details and all of the - as I said, the 10,000 things to do. So I would expect that those would materialize more in 2016 than in 2015, Don.","Don Carson","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi","I\u2019m going to make some comments about before we wrap-up, please. We are waiting for the queue from the operator. But first of all, I\u2019d like to thank all of you for being on our call today. But then, I just want to say that we will be holding our 2015 Investor Conference in New York on March 31. And we\u2019ll be - that event will also be webcast. What we will do in that Investor Conference, obviously, we are not going to announce any newer strategy or any new direction for the company, what - where we are going. And obviously we are going to be consistent with what we have told you before. But the key element of that meeting is going to be to giving you exposure to the real people who are actually doing these things.","The people who are key executive, who are actually responsible for delivering the results, so that you see that there is a depth of talents within their products, and then I think it\u2019s worthwhile to hear directly from them about what they are doing. I mean, in that Investor Conference are expect to be talking for 10 minutes, and then give our people and other five hours to tell you what they\u2019re really doing. So that\u2019s really the purpose of the meeting, and we are looking forward to your participation. But once again, thank you for being on the call and have a wonderful day. Thanks again.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."],"219":["Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.

Mr. Moore, you may begin.","Simon Moore","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products\u2019 third quarter 2014 results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. We issued our earnings release this morning.

As always, today\u2019s teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on this slide, and at the end of today\u2019s earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations.","Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you very much Simon and good morning to everyone. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call. We do appreciate your interest in our company.","Let me first introduce our team who will be participating in this call; Mr. Scott Crocco, our Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, who is responsible for our Merchant Gases; Mr. Steve Jones, who is responsible for our Tonnage Gases, Equipment and Energy; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, who is responsible for Electronics and Performance Materials.","Now please turn to page three. I believe that at this point it is necessary to answer the question that many of you have already asked me or Simon before this call. And that is why did I take this job? I am here because I believe that Air Products has the people, technologies and geographic footprint to significantly improve its performance. I consider it an honor and a privilege to lead and be part of this exciting time here at Air Products.","During the 1980s and early 1990s, I worked at another industrial gas company. During that time, we always compared ourselves to Air Products. Since Air Products was the best industrial gas company in the world. I had during that time a great deal of respect for Air Products\u2019 people and its leadership. I do believe Air Products has the potential to regain its leadership position. ","During the past three weeks that I have been officially here on the job, I have met more than 1,000 of our employees in small groups of 50 to 60 people to listen to their suggestions and answer their questions. As a result of what I have seen and heard in these meetings, I am excited, encouraged and enthusiastic about the future of Air Products.","I see a team of talented, dedicated and committed people who are ready for change, they are ready to deliver results and they want to regain the respect in the industry that they deserve. With the full support of our Board of Directors and the enthusiastic participation of our talented, committed and dedicated employees, we will move forward to create further value for our shareholders.","Now please turn to page four, so that I can explain some of the key principles that will guide us in managing our future. First, we believe that cash is king. We will focus our efforts to generate cash. You will notice the use of EBITDA in presenting our results and measuring our performance in the future. ","Second, I consider capital allocation to be a very significant part of my responsibility. We will only allocate capital to projects and activities that will create significant value for our shareholders. This leaves to the third point that in the long run the growth in the per share value of our stock is the true measure of our performance. Sales growth and corporate size is of no value if it does not result in an increase in the per share value of our Company stock. And the fourth point is that we believe high performance people want to be giving clear goals and be empowered to make decisions. A decentralized organization will create lines of responsibility and accountability is the best way to unleash our best people to lead at all levels of the organization and deliver results.","So with those comments, I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Chief Financial Officer. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you very much Seifi. Air Products delivered on our commitments in Q3. Our earnings came in at the top end of the guidance range we shared with you in April. We are focused on execution recovering the adverse weather impacts from Q2, bringing our plans on-stream, on-time, on-budget and safely, delivering on our cost reductions and loading the assets we have in the ground. As Seifi said, we have a great team that is excited about the path forward.","Turning to slide five, let me now take you through our fiscal Q3 results. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 3% above prior year on stronger volumes across all of our segments. Pricing was up 1% and underlying sales were up 4%, excluding the excluding the polyurethane intermediates or PUI business. Sequentially, overall sales increased 2% with underlying sales up 4% on higher volumes in our three largest segments. As Seifi mentioned, we are focusing more sharply on cash and specifically EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We have provided you a reconciliation in the appendix of the slides.","For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $653 million was up 7% versus prior year and 6% sequentially driven by higher volumes and new planned on-streams. Operating income of $440 million increased 8% versus prior year as we delivered operating leverage on higher volumes particularly in electronics and performance materials and we delivered better pricing in Merchant Gases. Our operating margin of 15.7% improved 70 basis points versus prior year as the positive contribution from higher volumes more than offset higher cost primarily from planned maintenance outages. As we said last quarter, we expect maintenance cost to be lower in the fourth quarter.","Net income and diluted earnings per share were 9% and 7% higher respectively versus last year. Our return on capital employed was 9.6%, 90 basis points lower compared to last year as a result of higher capital employed. This remains well above our 8% cost of capital. I want to remind you that the new projects we are developing, executing and operating will be accretive to ROCE over the next few years.","Turning to slide six, you can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter\u2019s performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.46 increased by $0.10 versus last year. Higher volumes across all segments increased EPS by $0.18. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together were flat. Net cost performance was $0.05 unfavorable as higher cost primarily the planned tonnage maintenance outages and inflation more than offsets of our 2012 and 2013 cost reduction programs. We delivered on the cost reduction actions and are seeing the benefits.","The impact of the PUI business exit was about $0.02. Interest expense was lower and contributed a penny on lower interest rates. Our tax rate of 24% remains unchanged. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning Painter","Thanks Scott. Please turn to page seven. Overall, the Merchant Gases segment had a very strong rebound from a challenging Q2. Volumes continue to improve. We showed good cost performance and we successfully recovered the expected portion of the Q2 weather cost. However, I want to be clear. We are not satisfied with this level of performance and certainly have opportunities to further improve this business. But that said, the team delivered on our expectations for this quarter.","Merchant gas sales of just over $1 billion were up 4% versus last year on 3% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Volumes were lead by strong overall growth in Asia and the U.S. and Canada and positive liquid oxygen and nitrogen volumes across all regions, partially offset by lower helium volumes globally. Sequentially, sales were up 4% and volumes were up 3% as we saw accelerating volumes in Europe, continued strength in Asia and an improvement in Latin America.","Our new helium plant in Wyoming is on stream and our supplier of crude helium continues to ramp production. While helium was still tight during the quarter, we began to see additional industry supply reduced tightness towards the end of the quarter. We would expect the supply and demand balance to shift going forward.","Merchant gases operating income of $174 million was up 5% versus prior year and up 21% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.1% was up 10 basis points compared to last year and up 230 basis points sequentially.","As I mentioned earlier, we recovered the expected portion of last quarter\u2019s unusual U.S. and Canadian weather related cost and expect this recovery to continue. While we were pleased with the move in our margin, I want to comment on the incremental margin. We shared with you that we expect incremental margins on existing asset loading to be in the range of 30% to 40%. A portion of the sales growth this quarter was not incremental loading of existing assets. The EPCO sales growth was not incremental as this was in acquisition we closed on during Q3 of last year.","Also, we shared a number of details regarding the China merchant market in last quarter\u2019s call. As you have heard Air Products and the industry are challenged with the supply that has grown faster than demand. We have not made the decision to add liquid capacity in China for over 18 months but we still have some liquid capacity to bring on stream. New capacity additions don\u2019t earn incremental returns and the pricing dynamics in China also limit margins in the near term.","One note as we look to Q4. As Seifi mentioned, we\u2019re going to see a greater emphasis on cash flow from us. As you may remember, when we sold our European healthcare business to Linda in 2012, a portion of the proceeds were contingent on a number of business retenders and we move this business to discontinued operations. The reconciliation is now complete and so we have made a payment to Linda in Q4 of about $158 million. This liability was already fully reflected on our balance sheet and so have minimal to know -- no P&L or EBITDA impact but it will affect cash flow and discontinued operations in Q4.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the merchant business by region. Please turn to slide eight. In the U.S. and Canada sales were up 8% on 3% higher volumes and 5% higher pricing. We continue to see nice growth in our liquid oxygen and nitrogen volumes with strength in the metals and chemicals markets as capacity utilization remains in the upper 70s, a full quarter of EPCO this year versus only month of last year was positive but helium argon were both down on limited supply. ","As I mentioned we saw some improvement in the helium supply near the end of last quarter but still down for the quarter versus prior year. Contract signings for last year remain above last year\u2019s strong results. Both helium and LOX\/LIN pricing continue to be positive as we work hard to continue to recover the Q2 weather impact in LOX\/LIN.","In Europe sales were up 6% versus last year due to currency as volumes were down 1% while prices were up 1%. LOX\/LIN and LAR volumes were positive but were offset by lower helium and cylinder volumes. LOX\/LIN volume growth was solid in central and north Europe and we were pleased to see strong end user volume growth in Southern Europe. While construction remains weak and cylinder volumes were down versus last year, we were also encouraged to see slight sequential improvement.","Contract signings for the quarter were up significantly from last year overall pricing was up slightly for the first time in a year and half as LOX\/LIN pricing was flat and both helium and cylinder pricing showed improvement. The team is very focused on aggressively managing pricing. LOX\/LIN plant loadings remain in the high 70s. We were pleased to announce the installation of a new air separation unit for AGC Glass in the Czech Republic, Asahi Glass, the world\u2019s largest producer of flow glass is seeing real benefits from the new plant that are helping them to meet their goals to produce the highest quality glass in an increasingly competitive market. A great example of our industry expertise enabling us to growth relationship that began in also 20 years ago.","In Asia, sales were up 5% versus last year on 6% higher volumes and 1% lower price. LOX\/LIN and LAR volumes continue to be up double digits in China and across the whole region while helium was down on supply limitations. With the strong volume growth planned loadings have moved up to the high 70s despite capacity additions. Contract signings for the year remain above last year\u2019s strong results. Pricing was down in the LIN, LOX and LAR business particularly in China driven in part by the whole steel market while helium pricing was up. ","We shared a fair amount of detail on the China merchant market in last quarter\u2019s call. As we said, we expect the supply demand dynamics to be challenging for a few years but it is encouraging to see an increase in our utilization rates.","We remain focused on using our applications expertise to help our customers improve throughput, reduce environmental impact and lower cost while creating new demand for industrial gases. In Latin America, underlying sales were up 4% while currency reduced reported sales by 12%. Brazil volumes were up and we saw a slight improvement in the Rest of South America but slower growth global economic demand, mitigated growth in Chile. We are seeing the benefits of our cost reduction focus on our business. LOX\/LIN plant capacity utilization remains in the mid 70s. ","Now let me turn the cal over to Steve for a review of our Tonnage and Equipment and Energy segments.","Steve Jones","Thanks, Corning. Good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 9, excluding PUI tonnage gases grew profit this quarter as the positive contribution from new projects and strong base business demand overcame the expected negative expense and volume impact from a higher level planned outages. Base demand particularly hydrogen in the U.S. Gulf Coast system remain strong. Overall sales of $835 million were down 1% versus last year. Gases volumes were up 2%, a strong U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen demand and a positive contribution from new plants, more than offset the maintenance outage impact. I know many of you have asked about the potential impact of lighter, sweeter shale oil on the U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen demand.","As you can see from our results over the last few quarters, we continue to see our customers running hard with significant hydrogen demand. While shale oil availability may moderate hydrogen demand growth going forward, our U.S. Gulf Coast customers are also adding heavy Canadian oil sands to a crude slate which bring significant hydrogen demand. And low cost natural gas creates an operating cost advantage for the refiners, allowing them to profitably export refined products. Overall, we may see some growth moderation but see no risk to our existing assets. Lower PUI volumes impacted sales by 4% or about $35 million and about $0.02 of profits.","As a reminder, we fully exited this business in Q1 of fiscal year \u201814 and for the full year still expect PUI sales down about a $140 million and about a $0.l0 EPS headwind. Excluding the effect of the PUI\u2019s business exit, operating income was up 3% versus prior year as the positive contribution from new plants overcame higher maintenance cost. Despite the cost and volume impact of the outages, our team executed well. Our maintenance cost is on budget and as we said last quarter, we expect to see a significant reduction in plant maintenance activities in the fourth quarter. We continue to execute on the projects in our backlog and while we may see the typical slight large plant schedule changes, we are seeing our customers successfully start-up their facilities.","We talked last quarter about bringing on stream our new world-scale hydrogen plant in St. Charles, Louisiana. Just in time to provide volume to customers as other plants were down for plant maintenance, a great example of the value of world\u2019s largest hydrogen pipeline network. ","Now please turn to slide 10, Equipment and Energy segment continues to see strong growth as our leading LNG position had a positive impact on sales and backlog. Sales of a $104 million were up 1% versus prior year while operating income of $70 million was up 9%, higher margin LNG projects and less lower margin ASU activity drove the profit increase. The backlog of $584 million is up significantly, as we announced the PETRONAS second floating LNG project order and received other customer awards that have not yet been announced.","The PETRONAS order represents Air Products third LNG order for the developing floating LNG market, great result for our technology and our team. Overall, LNG project development activity remains high. ","Now, I will turn the call over to Guillermo for review of our Electronics and Performance Materials segment results.","Guillermo Novo ","","Thanks, Steve. Please turn to slide 11, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment delivered another strong quarter as both businesses showed good volume growth and robust leverage to the bottom-line from our cost improvement actions. Segment sales of $618 million, were up 9% versus last year, driven by 9% higher volumes. Versus prior year, electronics sales were up 6% with strength across all segments. Advanced materials showed strong growth as our customers\u2019 ramped production of their next generation nodes driving demand for our materials. Process materials also saw volume growth and moderation of recent pricing pressure. Tonnage grew our new projects on streams and the equipment business was positive versus last year.","Sequentially electronics sales were up 2%. Performance materials was up 12% versus last year, as we saw strong growth across all regions and product lines. In fact this was a record volume quarter for the PMD business as we benefited from improved global economic demand, share gains and successful new product introductions. Sequentially sales were up 7%, higher than the typical seasonal improvement. Operating income of a $107 million was up 23% and operating margin was up 200 basis points to 17.3% as leverage from higher volumes was expanded with cost performance. We remain on track in our delivering, on our business restructuring and cost reduction programs. Sequential operating income was flat and margins were down 80 basis points compared to very strong Q2.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","","Thank you, Guill. Now please turn to slide number 12. Our guidance for the fourth quarter is for earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.65. We do appreciate that this represents the significant increase from the third quarter and you can see it will be the highest quarterly earnings that this company has ever delivered. But this is what we have already promised to our shareholders during the last call and we will do our best to deliver what we have committed to. We have been pull all the operating levers under our control to deliver these results. ","With respect to capital expenditure, we estimate about $2 billion for the fiscal year. I think it\u2019s also appropriate to make a comment on our energy from waste project in Tees Valley, in the United Kingdom. We planned to begin commissioning the first project late in first fiscal quarter of 2015 and currently expect commission operation late in second fiscal quarter of 2015.","I should also add that I\u2019m fully aware that all of you want to know when we will communicate more about our strategy going forward. We just do this and give you an update in less than two months in mid September and by early calendar of 2015, we will have an investor conference when you will meet our team and we will report on the progress we have made in implementing our strategy.","But today, I want to touch on another part of our effort to move that products forward that is our company culture. Please turn to a slide number 13. Our company culture is an important and essential part of implementing our strategy. I want to assess the words Air Products culture. We are a global company operating in more than 50 countries. Our people in these countries have their own unique cultures and we fully respect all of those diverse cultures.","What I\u2019m defining to in this slide is the Air Product culture that is the principals that we will follow when we are at work at Air Products. We will relentlessly focus to achieve outstanding and world class safety performance. Our goal is nothing less than zero accidents and incidents. We will work very hard to simplify our organization and we will focus everyday to simplifying our work processes so that our organization will move forward.","I am very focused on this issue of simplified organization and simplified work processes because I think that is the key to improving our productivity. We will perform our job in the sense of urgency, we believe that the speed of execution is a competitive advantage. And finally, we will act with self confidence, believing that we can set high goals for ourselves and have the ability to achieve them.","A positive can do attitude and culture at Air Products is a key element of success as we move forward. ","Now we will all be delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Seifi, I respect that you are not ready to talk about the go-forward yet. I am just wondering if you can kind of give us an overview of your macro view of the world. I am particularly interested in how you think about growth going forward in Europe and China both from a high level and then maybe from an industrial activity perspective.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, first of all good morning. I will be happy to do that Vincent but I will make a few comments and then I will ask it to turn it over to Scott, to give you a more detailed view of this but overall we see into economic activity in the United States. Overall Europe is kind of a stable and we do see significant improvements in certain parts of Asia, but as I said I will like Scott to make more detailed comments on that.","Scott Crocco","","Hi Vincent, good morning. So, our view of the economy here for fiscal \u201914 is very much in line with what our expectations were when we entered the fiscal year. So, just to remind you we will talk about in terms of manufacturing output for fiscal \u201914 we had projected manufacturing output to be up year-on-year from 2 to 4% and again we are expecting this is the year coming like that. In U.S. we also expect to see 2% to 4% year-on-year growth. In Europe 0 to 2% so the lowest area of growth recognizing it\u2019s also coming out of the recession the latest of all the different regions. In Asia, we have the projection of 5% to 7% manufacturing output growth year on year principally driven by China. And then in Latin America for the one area we had a range at beginning of the year of 1% to 3% year on year growth frankly that\u2019s the one are that\u2019s coming in at the low end of the range and perhaps below the low end of the range. But again overall we\u2019re seeing the economy in terms of manufacturing output play out larger like we expected when we began the fiscal year.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay, just as a follow-up, in Electronics, the equipment trends that were very strong in the prior quarter appear to have continued this quarter and my sense was that that was going to slow down. Has something changed and will this continue going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","I\u2019ll have Guillermo answer that please.","Guillermo Novo","Good morning. The equipment orders are strong. We expect them to continue to remain strong through this year early part of next year and then start tapering down towards the backend of next year.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you very much I\u2019ll pass it on.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And good luck to you Seifi in your new role.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, John.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","So I guess a couple questions. With regard to your big focus on cash flow and cash generation, can you walk us through at least the types of metrics you think are important in terms of how we would be judging free cash generation for an industrial gas company? ","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I think that the key area of focus is to make sure that you do projects that do generate cash that means that we will take a look at our hurdle rates to make sure that we have the kind of hurdles rates that then when these project come on stream they do generate the kind of cash that we would want to have. Are you referring to the absolute number John or just the relative number?","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Yes, if you\u2019ve got a specific say target for say a best in class that\u2019s more along the lines of what I was getting at.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, it might be a little bit too soon for me to give you a target John. But we do hope that we will generate a lot more cash than depreciation obviously. So that what we want to do is that we want to be free cash positive even after dividend that\u2019s for sure I\u2019ll go.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, I know it is a little bit early in the process, but it sounds like you have had an opportunity to meet with a lot of the people at Air Products and I am sure review the business at least to some degree. So I guess I'm wondering at least at your first blush would you say there are any major issues with regard to the long-term contracts that may not be fixable quickly or would you say some of the operational difficulties for Air Products over the past and maybe the underperformance is more of an operational focus that is something that could be fixed?","Seifi Ghasemi","John I do not see any significant problems that cannot be addressed and cannot be fixed. Our job over here is not to find excuses and complain about the past our job is here to move forward and deliver results. And whatever issue is there, there might be Air Products is a great company, great people and we will be able to address them and solve them. I am very positive and very excited about being here. We have a lot of projects we have a lot of exciting things to do some of them more difficult than others. But that\u2019s what makes life exciting and that\u2019s what makes discovery exciting, and my team over here is very energized. We will climb many mountains. We need to climb up in order to create value for shareholders John.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks very much Seifi and good luck again.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays","Yes, good morning. Seifi, just following along on your point too of kind of elements of success around the capital allocation, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about your higher return standards going forward, maybe as they would be used as a lens to look at some of the stuff that investors have argued back and forth in the history -- so coal gasification on-site in China, Tees Valley in the UK, the Indura acquisition and then kind of build it and they will come liquid capacity historically. As you look back at those capital decisions, can you walk through how you think those would fare in a new going-forward Air Products?","Seifi Ghasemi","Duffy first of all good morning. My job here is not to second guess anything the company has done. Right now as the CEO of the company I own everything whatever it is it\u2019s Air Products and my job is to look forward not backward. The one thing that I can tell you is that we will look very carefully at every investment and make sure that the returns are risk adjusted based on the circumstances. Obviously if you are doing a project in the U.S. versus we are doing a project somewhere else the risk elements are different. So I do not want to give you a target because then that\u2019s all competitive advantage I don\u2019t want to announce our targets and our strategy on a public call. But the one thing that I can assure you is that we will be looking at all of these targets very carefully and I made the general comment that we will raise our hurdle rates, yes.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays.","Okay. And then you also made the comment that, as you talked to folks throughout the organization, they were ready for change. As an employee, what kind of change should I expect to see over the next year? Is it getting leaner, do we have major cost reductions we need to go through? Is it hustling more to go out and get new business? What kind of changes do you want to drive in the organizational look of Air Products going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I think I\u2019ve tried to address that in my last slide which was fundamentally creating a culture which is focused on delivering results. We are not running a country club here we are running a company. And everybody needs to contribute and pull their own weight that is the key issue. And I think people are ready for that, they understand that. And with respect to I delineated for you the focus on safety fortunately that already exist at Air Products and I am very happy about that, simplifying our organization, decentralizing our organization and a sense of urgency to get things done. ","And I think as I said at the beginning, I have met with a lot of people. I am very encouraged about what I have seen. There is a very positive attitude and there is a great deal of pride in this company and people are going to rise up to the occasion and deliver and become the best gas company in the world.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays.","Great, thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","From Citi we\u2019ll now take P.J. Juvekar.","P.J. Juvekar - Citibank","Thank you. Seifi welcome to Air Products.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you very much.","P.J. Juvekar - Citibank","Air Products has spent about $4.5 billion in CapEx in the last three years, but that hasn't really shown up in earnings. So what is your understanding so far why we haven't seen that impact yet?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, on that front the general comment that I had is that a lot of those CapEx has been spent on long term projects. I mean you need to judge us on the performance of these projects over the next 15 years better than on the first year that had comes in operation. Projects get delayed so the customer is delayed and all of that. So, I don\u2019t think there is anything basically wrong with these projects and in time we will see the returns. Our job is that while these projects are coming on stream is to significantly improve our existing operations so that you see that at a better returns and better performance on a short term basis while these projects kind of get on line in the future and deliver the results. So, improving the short term results is something that we need to do that comes from improving productivity, increasing prices and all of the other things that one needs to do.","P.J. Juvekar - Citibank","Thank you. You have a plan of a decentralized model. Do you believe Air Products is too centralized and do you think decisions like pricing should be made locally? Thank you. ","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you. Do I think that Air Products is too centralized, yes I do. I think we should decentralize a little bit more. Yes. Okay?","P.J. Juvekar - Citibank","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan ","Hi. You spoke about price competition in the merchant markets in China. When you look at your larger capital projects, your larger on-site projects in China over a multiyear period, do you now expect somewhat lower expected returns on capital because various piggyback efforts would be diminished by the price competition, which was probably unforeseen at the time that the projects were designed or is it independent?","Seifi Ghasemi","Jeff, that\u2019s obviously very good question. I think Corning can answer that. Corning, please?","Corning Painter","Yes, thanks for the question. I think it\u2019s fairly straight forward. So if the pricing comes in to be below what we had expected. Yes, it\u2019s going to impact the return, maybe just give a little color on the China situation. So pricing right now I think has impacted impart by just real retail or wholesale price moving but also as we and others have brought on capacity very typical in the early years to low that with wholesale. And so as we get through the slug of capacity I think then there is a chance to move more and more to retail using our application skills to sell direct. And so I think we can look forward to some improvement from where we are today.","And I think you can expect projects that are closer to the coast, let\u2019s say the south of Shanghai, Pearl River Delta we\u2019ll see that more rapidly I think in the north it trends a lot uncovering policy around the steel industry and it just take a little bit longer as we move further west.","","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay. And then for my follow-up, in the tonnage discussion, you spoke about hydrogen demand in the Gulf Coast being relatively strong, but volume for the quarter was only up 2%. So what is the magnitude of the hydrogen growth and what are the specific factors or what is contracting that is diminishing the overall level of volume growth? ","Seifi Ghasemi","Jeff, another good question, I think Steve will be able to answer that. We were discussing that this morning. Steve?","Steve Jones","Sure. I guess Jeff if you look at the Gulf Coast hydrogen volumes over the last seven quarters this quarter was the highest by a fairly large margin, so good hydrogen volumes in the Gulf Coast. What kind of comes out on the other side of that was to cover balances is the outages. So, if you look at the 2% volume growth. The strong volumes from U.S. Gulf Coast and a new project impacts are offset by the outages, right. So, the outages tend to have an impact on that and particularly it\u2019s around, so I have talked to a lot of you over the years about we have base facility charges, they are generally paid during the outages but we also on a pipeline system, we have customers and we also customers who pay, have a minimum take or pay volume. That take or pay volume is over a 12 month period, so when we have an outage they won\u2019t necessarily take volumes and they will make that up over the next 12 months, so you do have a volume impact that occurs when you have maintenance outages.","Unidentified Company Representative ","","Jeff, if I may I think when it gets to the second quarter and third quarter of fiscal year next year, I think you will be able to see good improvement in the volumes which would validate the point because we can give you the outages by then.","Operator","","We will now move to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Very good, thank you. Seifi, there is a very well-documented margin gap between yourself and your US peer. How much of that gap is gettable, do you think, and in what timeframe? And even if you can't quantify it, maybe qualify your answer in that sense.","Seifi Ghasemi","","David, can you wait another two months, so that I can address this thing in mid-September.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","I will wait.","Seifi Ghasemi","","Yes, I appreciate that and then the other thing is that we always like to be number one not number two but we will address that for you in mid-September, okay?","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And may be just one more thing on first blush, does this entire portfolio to you make sense i.e. from the non-gas businesses, do they make sense to you longer term in this portfolio?","Scott Crocco","","Well, I believe that the entire portfolio of Air Products right now has room for improvement therefore we are going to take a look at that and right now push for improvement rather than saying we want to get rid of this part or that part. Once we have improved the rating then we have options to take a look at. So, I just want to say nothing is for sale right now, we are all focused on improving the performance of all of our businesses and there is room for improvement in all of our businesses.","Operator","From SunTrust we will now take James Sheehan.","James Sheehan - SunTrust ","","Thanks. A question for Scott. On the second-half outlook being a little bit more muted than you thought a quarter ago, is all of that in base business improvement or are there other factors that are in play here?","Scott Crocco ","","So, the top end of the range that we brought down was really driven more by the on streams from the new plants and it\u2019s just timing. It\u2019s difficult to predict exactly which plants are going to come up when, so the second half of the year as we have mentioned has got about two-thirds of the items are specifics and one-third for base improvement and there is no change to that. And so we are focused as Seifi mentioned on pulling all the leverage that we have at our disposal in order to deliver on the year.","James Sheehan - SunTrust","Thank you. And then a question for Seifi. In terms of the way this business is organized, we've looked at the merchant business and having margins in that business potentially in the high teens when it's running at a steady state. Do you still see that as an achievable objective or do you look at the Company in a different way given your cash flow focus?","Seifi Ghasemi ","","I believe that we have room for improvement and I like to turn to the gentleman who is going to deliver that for me and that\u2019s Corning, so Corning?","Corning Painter","","So, I think we have no question in anybody\u2019s mind in a merchant business that we can improve significantly from where our returns are now and get back to where we have historically been, I think in terms of timing and so forth I don\u2019t want to steal Seifi\u2019s funda for what we might say in September but absolutely positively the ability to improve this.","Operator","","And from Goldman Sachs we will now take Bob Koort.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Seifi, congrats on your move. Clearly, the market is excited. I think since the day you were announced, there has been a $3 billion market cap increase and -- you now trade at a 10% premium to all your industrial gas peers, so clearly the markets are embracing it. I'm curious, as you did your due diligence, you talked about the Company culture and what you are looking for in simplicity, speed and self-confidence. I'm assuming your view is there is quite a gap between where you want to be and where you are today. I am wondering if you could speak just a little bit about that. Or maybe what has caused that historically and how you can remove the impediments to being better in those regards.","Seifi Ghasemi ","","Bob as usual you like to ask very difficult questions, right. I think that the best way for me to describe it is that we do have a lot of good people here who remember the past when they were the best in the industry and they want to get back to that. I think the key impediments to the organization in the past have been simplicity of the organization and the sense of urgency and the speed in making things happen. And the other thing is I think is the issue of empowerment. I mean your chance on it company the size of Air Products by having 1% responsible for P&L, you need to empower people to make decisions all the way down the line.","So, if I wanted to kind of summarize it I think simplicity, the speed of execution and empowerment has been some of the issues that we will address and I think that would create a lot of, it has created a lot of excitement. I have spend a lot of time with our people as I said, I\u2019ve talked to more than a thousand people here and I intend to cover all the 1,000 people but people are very excited about everything, I am not facing a resistance of pushing against the closed door. This is very exciting for me quite answering.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","","So, Seifi, would it be fair to say you see it, and I agree with you. I mean if we went back to the 1980s and 1990s, you are right, Air Products was always considered sort of the premium in the industry. Is it just a function of we've had a couple decades of accumulated cultural headwind and so you think most of the change that is required is more around culture and less around assets? Is that fair?","Seifi Ghasemi","","I think as we go forward Bob, in my presentation you see what I said focusing on, I was focusing on the company culture and I think that is a significant opportunity for us then in addition to that we also need to look at the project as we go forward in terms of the returns and also in terms of the structure, our geographic focus, industrial gases is a local business, what is important is your strength in Southern Ohio, not your market share in all of the United States.","So, we will focus on all of that but yes I do believe that the culture change is a big opportunity, yes.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","","Terrific. Best of luck, Seifi. ","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you very much. Looking forward to seeing you soon Bob.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Good morning. Congratulations to you, Seifi. Given your increased focus on cash flow and your employment of higher hurdle rates in the future, can you comment, Seifi, on the shape of the project backlog and how much that might decline and how much your capital expenditures might come down in future years?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, good morning Kevin, first of all. I think that first of all what is I review is not going to add an effect in our backlog because the backlog is what we have committed and we are going to execute. In terms of what we will do in the future, it obviously depends on the opportunity but it also depends on the cash generation. One way to focus on cash generation is to cut expenditure and other one is to increase cash generation.","So, we are going to focus to increase our cash generation by being more productive and doing a lot of the right things that one needs to do and getting more out of what we have but in terms of what the shape of the future will be, it will depend on opportunities, it will depend on our ability to generate the cash that we need and then we will see how it works out, I don\u2019t see a significant drop off because we want to participate in the growth in the industry but we will obviously be a lot more careful about some of the things that we do.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And then second, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question. I heard your comment that you don't have any businesses for sale today. But are you generally happy with the composition of the portfolio or over the next several quarters, should we expect you to evaluate businesses in order to determine whether certain businesses may be core or noncore? Will you be engaged in that way or not?","Seifi Ghasemi","Kevin, my job is to constantly review our portfolio and see what can be done to maximize shareholder value. I\u2019m sure you heard me say that I\u2019m not enamored with size. Size doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is the value of our stock. So, you should expect us to constantly review our portfolio and decide what is the best course of action to create value for our shareholder, I don\u2019t want to pre-judge that, I do want to say that from what I see, all of our businesses have room for improvement.","So, it would be kind of premature to take any action before you get these businesses performing to the best of their ability.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","","We will now move to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc","","Hey, good morning guys and congrats to you Seifi for coming to Air Products.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc","Can you maybe comment on what you see is the growth opportunities in the industrial gas industry, do you think that Air Products is positioned well to participate in the growth over the next two years as you change the culture?","Seifi Ghasemi","I think Air Products is very well positioned for participating in the future because we do have the fundamental technologies that are required, I mean the future in the industrial gases in terms of growth is going to be in the areas of energy environment and all of that products extremely well-positioned in not only large ASUs but the smaller ASUs, mid-sized ASUs. We are world leaders in hydrogen and micro applications. So there is opportunity I do not see Air Products having a technology gap to prevent us from participating on those growth areas.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc","Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, when you think about decentralizing the business and maybe the way you organize your segments, is the right way to manage an industrial gas business -- is it by segment like you have it now or is it by region? Any major changes in the way your operating management will be set up?","Seifi Ghasemi","Can I answer that question for even in middle of September so that I don\u2019t get it ahead on myself?","Mike Sison - KeyBanc","Absolutely.","Seifi Ghasemi","I would appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Good morning. Two quick ones just at the end. First, do you have a metric for how much outages have been a drag to cash flow or EBITDA over the last three years? And secondly, in the past, there has been a tension between the Air Products long-term growth and [Indiscernible] focus and the stock market's relatively short horizon sometimes. And as you are looking at the realignment of the business, are you willing to invest in things near term because you see the cash flows three, four, five years out or are you committing to sort of a floor, so to speak, in terms of choppiness around cash flow in the near term as well?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I like to Simon to make a comment on that. But before that let me just say we are running Air Products for the long term, and this is not something that we are going to do to make ourselves look good in one year and then damage the company in the second year. I mean Air Products is going to be here for another 200 years and we are going to run the company properly for the long term, so just wanted to make that comment. But I\u2019d like Simon to make a comment on the other two issues that you raised and also Scott if you want to. Simon?","Simon Moore","Laurence, just a couple of quick numbers, so as you know, we said this year we\u2019d expect to manage cost we are at 2% headwind versus prior year. Fundamentally on average our total maintenance cost for the company is about $250 million a year of expense audit fees to so it\u2019s also a capital component as well. So hopefully that frames it and we can follow up later on if you\u2019d like.","Seifi Ghasemi","Okay, thanks Laurence.","Operator","From Susquehanna Financial we\u2019ll take Don Carson.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Yes, hi, Seifi. Two questions, one on the capital structure side. Traditionally industrial gas companies have been pretty conservative on wanting to maintain an investment-grade rating. Are you willing to lever the Company up more to perhaps return cash to the shareholders a little quicker than you might get from an operational improvement in cash flow? And then, secondly, as you look at your North American position, do you think you are disadvantaged by not having a cylinder gas position to take advantage of this long forecast manufacturing renaissance?","Seifi Ghasemi","First of all, good morning, Don. Last time you asked me a question about industrial gases it was about 20 years ago but anyway good to talk to you again. I am, first of all we do value our investment grade rating and we would want to maintain that unless a phenomenal opportunity comes about but I don\u2019t foresee that right now. So, maintaining investment grade is important to us. As far as the lack of the so called package gases business in the United States, I don\u2019t consider it a significant disadvantage it\u2019s something that is nice to have but is not a must have. If we can create that at a reasonable cost and a reasonable price that would be something that we will look at. But I do not consider that to be a significant competitive disadvantage we can compete the way we are.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question will come from Mark Gulley with BGC.","Mark Gulley - BGC Partners","Yes. Return on capital was not mentioned either in your slide 4 or your later slide about the Ses. Can you comment on the fact that Air Products has been below double-digit ROC and how you might see that metric going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I think that our ROC is going to kind of not improve very quickly in the short term because we have a lot of CapEx that is being spent that is not currently generating revenue. So I would see that being going down but our goal is to increase the return on capital to what I think the industry is capable of delivering which is to up to 13%, that is obviously will be our goal. But I think in the short term I mean you know this Mark in short term we will while these projects are being built you obviously have depreciation without much profit against it.","Mark Gulley - BGC Partners","And then if I dispose with an observation I welcome as well as others do the fact you are showing EBITDA for the company. You may want to show EBITDA for each segment as well so we track back to.","Seifi Ghasemi","We will, we will show EBITDA for the segment, for the business unit. EBITDA will be what we will guide us in terms of not only measuring performance but also for our reward system that we will be very focused on that market. And thank you for your remark, I appreciate that.","Scott Crocco","","Okay, thank you very much everybody. We do appreciate your participation in the call and we look forward to seeing many of you as we go on the road on next call. Thanks again and have a great day.","Operator","","Once again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Simon Moore","Thank you, Leanne [ph], and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products fourth quarter 2019 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number two. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless, we specifically state otherwise, we are referring to adjusted non-GAAP measures, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin on both the company-wide and segment basis, and ROCE. Reconciliations can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We are very pleased that our record fiscal year earnings per share of $8.21 represents our fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, and our earnings per share of $2.27 for the quarter also represents and another record, up 14% over the last year's strong results, and is the 22nd, and I\u2019d like to stress 22nd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. Scott will comment on our financial results in more details. So I'm going to focus my comments on safety, our higher purpose as a company, the very large acquisition in Saudi Arabia that they announced last week, and the press release we issued yesterday.","Now please turn to Slide #3. Safety without question is job number one for all of us at Air Products. And our goal has always been zero accidents and zero incidents. Although you can see our good progress versus 2014, our safety performance in 2019 was not acceptable as we did not show improvement versus 2018. Our people are certainly redoubling their efforts in this area, so that we can move toward our ultimate goal of an accident-free work environment.","Now, please send to Slide #6, our Five-Point Plan. I want to comment on point number five on the right hand side, which describes our higher purpose. We believe that in addition to creating value for our shareholders, through strong financial results, we do have a responsibility as a public company to define the higher purpose in what we view. Our higher purpose at Air Products is to create a diverse company that people from all around the world and from all sections of the society feel they belong and are treated as an equal part of the team, a company that people's contributions are recognized and appropriately rewarded, a company that people want to work for where they are proud to be part of the innovative process to solve the world's energy and environmental challenges, a company that is absolutely committed to sustainability and to the environments, and a company that is supportive of the local communities where we live and work. That is our higher purpose and we are committed to it.","Now, please go to Slide #9 please to discuss our very large $11.5 billion acquisition in Saudi Arabia. You have seen this picture before, but it has been updated to reflect the latest information. Saudi Aramco is close to completing the construction of a 400,000 barrel per day refinery in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The highest sulfur vacuum resid from this refinery can no longer be used to few ships due to the new IMO 2020 regulation. Therefore, this liquid resid will be mixed with oxygen and gasified to produce synthetic gas. This same gas is almost equivalent to natural gas and it will be used to drive turbines to produce 3,900 megawatt of power. The joint venture is acquiring all of the assets, including air separation units, the gasifiers, power generation and the related utilities for almost $11.5 billion. The joint venture will own an operative facility and deliver power and hydrogen to Saudi Aramco for a monthly fee. This, of course, is the same business model as our traditional onsite business.","Now please go to Slide #10. This very large acquisition will be owned by new joint venture company called The Jazan Integrated Gasification Company. The joint venture will be owned 20% by Saudi Aramco, 25% by Aqua Power, the largest independent power producer in the Middle East, 46% directly by Air Products, and 9% by products Air Products Qudra, which we call APQ, which is a joint venture of Air Products and Qudra Energy, there Air Products owns 51%, so Air Products\u2019 total ownership will be just over 50%.","Now please turn to Slide #11. The acquisition will be funded by 40% equity from the shareholders and 60% debt. In terms of timing, we had expected the transaction to be closed by the end of calendar 2019. But recently we have been informed that due to the extensive documentation required to launch the financing, the closing here now expected to be in the first quarter of calendar year 2020.","In terms of accounting, at this point, we are not expecting to consolidate the full financial results of this entity in Air Products, so that results will be reflected in equity affiliated income. Based on the ownership percentage and the debt to equity split, Air Products\u2019 cash contribution to this project will be $2.3 billion.","We do not \u2013 and I\u2019d like to stress, we do not plan to disclose the details of this project in terms of profitability. But I do want to confirm for you that the return on this investment will be better than the general guidance for investment that we have given to our investors in the past. As for the press release we issued last night, that is related to our plan to build an industrial gas pipeline system in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, which could be similar to our hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen pipeline system in the U.S. Golf Coast to sell all of the refineries and chemical plants in that part of the world. The press release confirms that The Royal Commission has given us permission to proceed with the project, and we will update you about this project every quarter in terms of what we are doing. This is a major step forward for us in Saudi Arabia in addition to the acquisition.","Now, please turn to my favorite Slide #13. You can see our record EBITDA margin of almost 42%, which is up almost 1,700 basis points from early 2014.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to give you the details of our financial performance. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you very much Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 14 for our full year results. We delivered another strong year of underlying sales growth and very strong profit growth despite modest economic activity around the world. Sales of almost $9 billion were flat versus last year, as 2% volume growth and 3% price were offset by non operational factors. Specifically, weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Chinese RMB, euro and British pound lowered sales by 3%, and the India contract modification, which had no profit impact, reduced sales by another 2% compared to prior year. The volume growth was primarily driven by new plants, particularly, Lu'An, and supported by positive base volume.","Sales from the very successful Jazan sales equipment project were lower as the project nears completion. This negatively impacted volumes by 2%. We saw price improvement in all three regions and across major product lines. Strong price and volume led to another year of double-digit profit growth despite currency headwinds. EBITDA improved 11% to nearly $3.5 billion. EBITDA margin of 38.9% was up 400 basis points, primarily due to the better price and volume. The India contract modification contributed 80 basis points. Record earnings per share of $8.21, was up 10% versus prior year. Our FY '19 CapEx of $2.1 billion was lower than we had forecasted on project and M&A timing, and ROCE improved 70 basis points to 13.1%.","Now please turn to Slide 15. Our full year EPS from continuing operations of $8.21 increased by $0.76 per share, driven by our strong operating performance. Price, volume and costs combined contributed over $1 per share, and excluding the impact of negative currency, EPS in total was up nearly $1 or 13% compared to prior year, a slightly higher tax rate of 19.4% reduced EPS by $0.09, and other items together added $0.01. This includes higher non-controlling interest, primarily due to the Lu'An project. We expect an effective tax rate of 20% to 21% in fiscal year 2020","Now please turn to Slide 16. We continue to generate strong cash flow. For the full fiscal year 2019, we generated almost $2.7 billion or over $12 per share of distributable cash flow. This is an increase of almost 20% or close to $2 per share from 2018. From this distributable cash flow, we paid almost 40% or $1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have nearly $1.7 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.","Slide #17 provides an update on our capital deployment progress. As you can see, we now show almost $18 billion of investment capacity available over the five-year period from FY 2018 through FY 2022. As expected, our total capacity continues to grow as we increased EBITDA. The almost $18 billion includes about $9.5 billion of additional debt capacity available today, $5 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY '22, and over $3 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. Today we have a total of about $7.6 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $6.6 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see we've already spent 18% and already committed well over half of our total available capacity.","Now please turn to Slide 18 for a few comments on our fourth quarter results. Sales of $2.3 billion were roughly flat as 8% volume and price growth was offset by lower energy pass-through, the India contract modification and negative currency impact. Volume added 5% due to new plants, base growth, acquisitions and a short-term contract in Asia. Lower Jazan sales equipment activity reduced sales by 2%. Price was up 3% with strong performance in all three regions, continuing the positive trend from prior quarters. Although unfavorable currency persisted, EBITDA of almost $1 billion improved 16%, and EPS of $2.27, was up 14%. EBITDA margin of almost 42% is up over 600 basis points, primarily driven by a higher price and the strong volumes. Lower energy pass-through and the India contract modification contributed about 200 basis points. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 7%, as all segments improved, particularly Asia, driven by strong volume performance.","Please turn to Slide 19. Our fourth quarter EPS of $2.27 was up 14%, or $0.27 per share. Volume, price and costs together contributed almost $0.40, extending the strong operating performance from prior quarters. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.03 unfavorable, primarily due to the Chinese RMB, the euro and the British Pound. Our effective tax rate of 20.2% was 260 basis points higher than last year's lower than typical rate, which reduced EPS by $0.08. Non-controlling interest, primarily due to Lu'An, reduced EPS by $0.04.","Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Scott. Before I get into the segment results for this quarter, please turn to Slide #20, there you can see the regional EBITDA margins for the year. Our teams have worked very hard to make significant improvements, especially with modest economic growth globally.","Now please turn to Slide #21, there you can see the impressive results generated by our business in Asia. This strong performance reinforces that our business has not been materially affected by trade tensions. Furthermore, our customers and Chinese Government continue to be excited about how Air Products is helping China may meet its goals. They are very supportive. We are successfully executing projects and remain very optimistic about our long term prospect in this region of the ward. ","For the quarter, sales increased 16% from last year with volume and price together up nearly 20% Volumes increased 16%, driven by new projects, a short-term supply contract and based business growth. As a reminder, Lu'An came fully on its stream during the fourth quarter last year. So the year-on-year benefit was more modest this quarter. Merchant volume was impacted by China's moderating economic growth and some industrial production curtailments in preparation for the country's 70th anniversary celebrations. Overall, pricing for the region increased 3%, the 10th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Price was positive in all key countries.","Profit and margins were highest, driven by the strong volume, price and productivity that more than offset negative currency. EBITDA increased 31% and EBITDA margin expanded 550 basis points to over 48%, sequentially, profit growth lack volume growth as we saw higher costs, including plant maintenance and annual value of composition.","In terms of projects, we are continuing our discussions with the YK Group for the very large coal to syngas project, and are being told that the project is still expected to proceed, but we do not expect on a stream before 2023.","Now I would like to turn the call back to Scott to discuss our Americas results. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 22 for a review of our Americas results. Americas strong pricing trend continued, up 3%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement. Price was better across all major product lines and in all sub-regions. Overall, sales were down 5%, as higher price was more than offset by 2% lower volume, 5% lower energy pass-through, and 1% weaker currency. Volume was weaker this quarter due to planned Gulf Coast customer outages and continued difficult economic conditions in South America. EBITDA of $412 million increased 3% as strong price overcame the negative impact of lower volume and higher maintenance costs. EBITDA margin of 44% was up 350 basis points. Energy pass-through contributed about 180 basis points.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?","Simon Moore","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our EMEA results. Our EMEA business overcame the challenging economic conditions in the region and continued to deliver strong results. Price increased 4% with improvement across all major products and sub-regions. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Volume was up 5%, primarily driven by increased demand for hydrogen in our Rotterdam Pipeline System, and our previously announced CO2 business acquisition, while base merchant business volume remained stable.","Sales were negatively impacted by 5% lower energy pass-through, 4% unfavorable currency, and 12% from the India contract change. EBITDA of $193 million was up 11%, and was up 16% on a constant currency basis, supported by the strong volume and pricing. EBITDA margin reached almost 40%, an improvement of over 800 basis points. The India contract change and lower energy pass-through contributed about 600 basis points.","Now please turn to Slide 24, Global Gases, which includes our air separation unit, sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Our results declined due to lower project activity as we approach the successful conclusion of our Jazan ASU sale of equipment project.","Please turn to Slide 25, Corporate segment, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales and profits were higher this quarter supported by contributions from the Golden Pass LNG project and lower corporate costs. Although the profit shown in this quarter is still modest, we expect the performance of this segment to improve. We remained optimistic about additional LNG orders since our technology has been selected for several major projects around the world that are awaiting final investment decisions or final agreements with our customers.","Now I'm pleased turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon. Please turn to Slide #26. As you all know, we continue to live in an uncertain world that we at Air Products cannot control. But we do have control over the actions Air Products can take to succeed in dynamic and changing world. We have a strong, capable and flexible organization that remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promises to our investors. Consistent with our goal to achieve an average annual growth rate of at least 10%, we are extremely pleased to provide EPS guidance for fiscal year 2020 of $9.35 to $9.60, up 14% or 17% over our strong fiscal year 2019 performance. This includes our expected contribution from the Jazan project. We expect our fiscal year 2020 capital expenditure to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, which includes the expected spending for the Jazan project. For quarter one of fiscal year 2020, our earnings per share guidance is $2.05 to $2.10, up 10% to 15% over last year.","Now please turn to Slide #27. At midpoint, our fiscal year 2020 guidance represents six consecutive years of double digit earnings growth and 14% average cumulative earnings growth per share over this six years timeframe. Thanks to the great team of Air Products, we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders 5.5 years ago that we would grow Air Products EPS at least 10% a year. Our team in underworld continues to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products. Our five-point strategic plan will differentiate us and drive our success going forward. Our safety, productivity and operating performance provide the foundation for our continued growth. We have the financial capacity, the technical position, and knowhow and the challenge and people to take full advantage of the very exciting opportunities ahead of us.","And finally, please turn to Slide #28. As always our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our strong performance. I want to thank all our 16,000 people around the world for their commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together. I am certainly proud to be part of this winning team.","Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Your sequential prices in China were flat. Is there a flattening out of price in that market or is it some kind of pause? What are the price dynamics in China?","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","I would not characterize that as a slowing down of the price increases. In the fourth quarter, in China, there was a very interesting dynamic because a lot of the industries around Beijing, they\u2019re ordered to be shutdown so that there will be clean air for their celebrations on October 1st. Obviously, if that happens, demand goes down and the leverage on pricing goes down. I think that once we get back to normal, which is where we are, that trend will continue.","Jeff Zekauskas","And could you also comment on price trends in Europe and in the United States for 2020 for the industry generally, and there has, obviously, been an industrial slowdown. Is that something that you think would put pressure on industry prices or do you think that -- there is -- or do you think that bonus is not significant enough to deter the underlying trend?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, Jeff, that's a very interesting question, because it, obviously, everything depends on the level of activity and then the economic activity, supply demand and all of that. What I can tell you is that in the guidance that we have given you.","Jeff Zekauskas","Yes.","Seifi Ghasemi","We have assumed modest price increases, not significant price increases. So we have been conservative on pricing.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Now the situation turns to be better then we will do better.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. Can you talk a little more color on the MOUs that both you and the Saudi announced last week and some additional color last night? There is still seemed to be a few constructive moving parts. So just sitting on some of the potentially at least the timing regarding Jazan understanding you can't exclusively quantify as well as the opportunities love to come just, anything you'd like share and that would be a appreciated. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Chris. First of all, can I just comment on Jazan. We are trying to raise more than $7 billion of debt. The banks and our advisors have told us that, look, this cannot done overnight Seifi. It's too optimistic. It's going to take time not only to raise the money at fixed interest rate, but then all of the documentation that is required to actually get to an absolute closing. So we are in the estimate that we have given you we have assumed that this thing will close in the first quarter of calendar 2020, and we have included an appropriate amount of profit in our guidance. Then with respect to the announcement that we made last night, that is pretty significant because that allows us -- that the Royal Commission has approved that Air Products can build facilities and then connect them by a pipeline to serve and optimize all of the requirements of hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in the Jubail area, which I'm sure you're very familiar, is there most of the refineries and chemical plants are. The -- nobody can go and lay a pipeline without the permission of The Royal Commission. So this is going to give us the capability to build a steam methane reformer, new coal gasification in that part of the world, and convey the hydrogen, and then optimize the hydrogen consumption in that part of the world. It can create significant opportunities for investment, but the key, and that is why we\u2019ve made the announcement. The key was having the permission from The Royal Commission to lay the pipeline. We are going to move on this thing very quickly. We have identified a significant number of projects that can be done. The customers in that part of the world are very excited, because, if we do this and build this hydrogen pipeline, the same day that the other hydrogen pipelines in the U.S. Gulf Coast, it gives you the ability to connect these different plants and it significantly increases the reliability of the operation, because you have several production facilities connecting to a pipeline, if one production facility goes down people don't suffer. So this is a very, very positive development for us, and it gives us an ability to actually go and do a lot of these projects. Because if we had built a steam methane reformer or if we had built a gasification unit to gasify petcoke, and all of that, but if we couldn't connect them, it wouldn't have been as interesting. So this is pretty significant, and we are very proud of it and we are very thankful to the Saudi Government to allow us to do this, which is a totally separate project from Jazan. Okay, Chris?","Christopher Parkinson","Yes, that's very helpful. Also in your press release you explicitly called carbon capture, and there's also recently in front of one of the few highlights within your sustainability report, I think it\u2019s like 55 million tons in \u201818 or so. You also hit on a lot of 2020 goals regarding energy, water conservation, et cetera, et cetera. Can you just hit on the opportunity longer term understandably for Air Products on the carbon capture front, again, some of the rhetoric in the U.S, California, Europe, and just how some of these sustainability factors should ultimately help profitability? Just anything to help us conceptualize the longer-term financial opportunity on some of these GST factors would be appreciated? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Chris, thanks for the question. We have always said at Air Products we are focused on energy, which is gasification, huge amount of opportunity there and it is gasification of coal, petcoke, vacuum resid and all of that and you see examples of that. But when you are doing gasification, the CO2 is captured ready. So there is significant opportunity to capture that CO2, and try to really get to a totally clean coal gasification, where you gasify the stuff, you capture the CO2, and therefore, you don't put anything into the atmosphere that. We have the technologies to capture this and use it for and enhance old recovery. We are already doing this in Texas at Port Arthur. We do have technologies to capture this and do sequestration that means injected into the ground, and we have developed technologies and we are enhancing on that and we have done a lot of good work on trying to capture the CO2, and do what is called dry reforming, which means recycle it back and break it back into CO and hydrogen. So these are the projects that we have. Some of these projects are longer-term projects, Chris. They are not going make us an EPS in 2020 or 2021, but definitely they are the future. I believe very strongly that the future is about carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility and gasification. The amount of opportunities that we see, it\u2019s significant, it\u2019s even more than what I talked last quarter or even the quarter before. The whole world is focused on this. We, by buying the Shell and GE technology, are in a totally unique position to provide the gasification technology. We already do have their hydrogen for mobility, and we are the world leader on that as we are developing their carbon capture. So all these put together is going to transform Air Products into a company that is the solving environmental, the urgent environmental issues of the world, and we will be properly rewarded for that. And I think people will be excited about it when we get to '23, '24, '25, when we will be doing a lot of these projects. But we need to start and we are starting right now. And as I said, I can\u2019t point to the fact that we are doing this project and it\u2019s going to give you this much EPS in 2021, but believe me, these things will catch up in time. But the same day that we have started the gasification, five years ago, and now after five years, I have a Jazan project to present you. We are starting on these things, and in time, we will be able to present very exciting projects for our investors.","Operator","And we will take our next question P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar","So, clinically, given the industrial slowdown, I was trying to figure out what are your volume same-store sales, if you exclude the start \u2013 volume from the new project start-ups? Can you talk about your organic volume growth in three regions?","Seifi Ghasemi","Our organic volume growth is nothing to rise home about because the economies in the world are not performing, P.J. I mean we had in the United States of America, everybody is excited and looks at the stock market, and, yeah, it looks pretty good, but the real economy is going nowhere. Industrial production is down. That is what drives our business, same thing in Europe. And then in China, year-over-year -- they are growing at 6.5%, but year-over-year they are not growing. So if you look at our base business, there is no growth. That is why we have tried to transform the company into generating our own growth. If we hadn't done that, we would not be in a position today to sit down and give you a forecast for next year of 17% EPS growth. We would have been swapped and our costs would have gone out and probably would have been negative. That is the issue that most people have. The fact -- so our underlying volumes definitely reflect the state of the economy, which means, relatively it\u2019s going nowhere, no growth in the U.S., no growth in Europe, and China is flat although that is 6.5% growth, but it is flat. So you're absolutely right, our base business is not going anywhere. And if you get dependent on that, we would be in a sad shape right now.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you for that explanation. And then on the Jazan JV, you decided to buy the assets, which makes it capital intensive, but maybe that's how what was needed to make the deal happen. Should we think about this as the model for future projects in China?","Seifi Ghasemi","P.J., by buying air separation unit as part of the whole thing, it will significantly enhance our return, because the return on the air separation unit by itself was less than including it as part of the new acquisition. So we actually did something to enhance our returns on that. In terms of the model, yes, we definitely wherever we are supplying oxygen to a gasifier, we are interested in buying the gasifiers. That is our business model and there are plenty of opportunities for doing that and in time we will appropriately announce projects in that regard.","P.J. Juvekar","I\u2019m sorry, I know about gasifier, I'm just was talking about the power plant and the other ancillary units? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","P.J., the power plant is something unique in Jazan. They usually wouldn't want to be buying power plants. But in Jazan, the only day that Saudi Aramco would agree to part with their assets was that if they had one person to go to, in case they struggle, they didn't want to separate it that we would buy the gasifiers and somebody else would buy them. So that is why the combined forces and we bought the whole thing, but that is not a business model that we want to do around the word. They definitely want to stay with the gasifiers. But there might be unique situations where they have to do that, but we do what is best for in terms of return, and what's best for the shareholders.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","So if we are just looking at 2020, how much will new projects contribute to EPS growth next year versus this year?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, we obviously don't give that detail because then people figure out productivity of all of our projects. But considering what I was saying with respect to P.J\u2019s question that the world is not going anywhere in terms of economic growth, then you can almost think that any kind of a growth that we get next year is related to pricing and new projects, because a very basic business, and then we have to work hard in productivity to pay for the cost increases.","David Begleiter","Very helpful. And can you just go through merchant pricing by region in the quarter, how much was up?","Seifi Ghasemi","Yeah, merchant pricing was up in the Americas by approximately 8%, in Europe by about 7%, and in Asia by about 7%, for a total of about 7%.","Operator","And our next question will come from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.","John McNulty","With regard to the $6 billion to $7 billion that you still have to spend in terms of capital deployment, I guess, how should we be thinking about how that's allocated towards some of the new Saudi opportunities with the MOU that you\u2019re talking about for some of the other opportunities around coal gasification? And I guess, maybe an update us to how the coal gasification project pipeline is looking at this point giving kind of the time -- since we heard last on that?","Seifi Ghasemi","Coal gasification project pipeline is actually looking scarily. There are more opportunities that we can quote honestly, possibly keep up with it. But in terms of giving you a breakdown of the $6 billion or $7 billion or $8 billion or $10 billion that we still have to spend, John, it will be difficult because it depends on which projects come first on all of that. But I definitely can see us significant additional investments in Saudi. I hope significant investments in U.S. because we really do want to invest in the U.S. and we are pursuing some opportunities there. And obviously, opportunities in China, opportunities in Indonesia, and probably significant opportunities in India, because India has finally broken up to the fact that, hey, we should do what the Chinese are doing. Use the coal to gasify and then get ourselves independent of own. So there is going to be \u2013 it\u2019s difficult for me to give you an exact breakdown, but it is going to be in areas like Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, China, and hopefully the U.S.","John McNulty","Got it. Thanks for the color. And then just maybe a little bit of housekeeping. On the Americas business, how much of that of the volume weakness was tied to kind of the one-offs around outages versus just general macro weakness?","Seifi Ghasemi","Not a lot of it. But it\u2019s the general macro business, and obviously, Latin America.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","If I can just follow up on the \u2013 and, well thank you. On the South American volume issue you\u2019ve referenced in the press release. Was that actually worse than you anticipated, and with some of it due to -- some of the civil unrest that's taking place in certain regions down there?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, the civilian unrest has started after we closed the fiscal year, so that has had, unfortunately, that will have a negative effect in the first quarter, but it's just a general slowdown, Vincent. Things are not that exciting in that part of the world.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And then if I could, yeah, now I understand. And then just on depreciation and amortization for next year given obviously big step up in CapEx, what's around number we should be using for that?","Seifi Ghasemi","I mean, we don't disclose that, but it will be \u2026","Scott Crocco","I would say, Vincent, just in general, that's going to continue to go up as we deploy the capital, recognizing and it\u2019s also going to move around for things like currency as we translated back in the U.S. dollars. We don't give the guidance, but generally speaking as we deploy more capital, we would expect G&A to go up.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne","Another one of the Saudi projects that you listed in your press -- in your slide deck is the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle program in Saudi. And just wanted to ask you what you see is really limiting the development of such a program there. You mentioned this pipeline that you're starting to work on is having a hydrogen pipeline and enabling infrastructure for such a development and also just want to ask whether you had any IP associated with such a program.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, we do have the IP, and I think that that opportunity is going to be significant because that is one of the reasons that we want to build the pipeline in such a way that you can do a lot of gases -- equivalent of gases stations and connect them to the pipeline, and basically create a hydrogen corridor in that sort of the world and get people excited about driving hydrogen cars. The Saudi Government is very supportive of this. They want to see this happen. And you're right, there are going to be a lot of opportunities. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of numbers and so on, but is \u2013 we certainly are in the right path in developing this opportunity in that part of the world, and quite honestly, in other parts of the world.","Stephen Byrne ","And Seifi, you mentioned the challenges of raising the $7 billion of debt associated with Jazan, I just wondered if any of that is a fallout of the Saudi Aramco attacks from a couple of months ago. Is that raising any additional hurdles for you?","Seifi Ghasemi","I'd just like to make sure that I explained. We don't see any issues with raising the debt. I said it's an issue of how much time it's going to take. It is one thing you go to the market and you raise the debt, and you get the commitment of the banks. But then after that, you have to come up with a significant amount of documentation in order to get to a closing, and that is going to take time, and obviously you're not going to get any fees until after they have actually legally closed. That's what I was mentioned. But in terms of actually raising the money, I think that the demand is there and the banks are very optimistic that we will get very attractive interest rates.","Operator","And will take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Mike Leithead","This is actually Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. I guess first, Seifi, if I look at Slide 13 on margin improvement, there was a big jump up the first two years when you got Air Products and things leveled off for two years or so, and now it seems that taken another material leg up in the past year on margin. So I was hoping you can maybe lay out some of the drivers of this recent move up whether it's cost reduction or the benefits from energy pass-through, and just a 40% plus margin is the new normal fair products going forward.","Seifi Ghasemi","The first jump that you saw was obviously all of the productivity and the $400 million, $500 million of costs that we took out of the system, so that happened. And then, obviously, it was constant because these are working on the growth projects. And now, what is happening is that all of these things we were talking about are actually coming to fruition, we had Lu'An running, we're going to have Jazan running, we have a lot of other projects running and those projects that we have now signed up are actually pretty profitable projects. And that is now reflecting on the results. So we jumped because we had the productivity, we were focused on that, then it took us upon to get the growth opportunities lined up, and now we are seeing the benefit of that. Now whether our EBITDA margins for the long-term are at around 38% or 39% or 40% or 41%, depends on the projects, but I think, I feel pretty good that they will stay in the high 30s, and rather than being 32% or 33%, they will be 38%, 39%, 40%.","Mike Leithead","Got it. That's really helpful. And then following up on the Jazan project, I appreciate that you not going to provide detailed financial details. But when you look at the earnings contribution internally that you would expect today versus maybe when you announced the project back in last August, are the project economics, or is the IRR, better today than they originally looked when you announced the JV or roughly the same?","Seifi Ghasemi","They're better. And I mean, I say I'm not going to give any detailed numbers, because obviously our customers don't want us to do that. But, at the same time, we are giving you the guidance that, look, we have always told you that for every dollars of cash, we get you that we put out to get some percent operating profit. So it's not too difficult to activity figure out, and we\u2019re saying this is better than that. So you can get to a pretty good estimate about what this thing will do for us.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Don Carson","Want to talk \u2013 I know you talked about creating your own growth because obviously this is not much going on in the industrial economy these days. So, last year, I think onsite in pipeline was 52% of sales, where did you come out in '19? And by the time you make all these additional capital commitments in new projects by '23, where do you see the mix of onsite business going versus where is now?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, my goal is in time for that to get to 70%, 75% of our sales. But right now, obviously, once Jazan comes on the stream, it will be better than where we are, and all of these other projects. So our goal is to significantly increase our onsite business because that brings a lot more stability in terms of our earnings.","Scott Crocco","Yeah, Don, if I could -- I think absolutely, over the long run, as Seifi said and in reality, we are increasing our onsite business. Just remember one new launch for '19 will be because we change the India contract that will reduce that revenue, but that doesn't really change the fundamental concept of our onsite business is increasing.","Don Carson","And just as a follow-up on gasification. Obviously, Jazan has driven by IMO, and they need to do something else with the backend residuals. What's the pipeline for other similar opportunities in the refining sector?","Seifi Ghasemi","Significant. We have always said that this and it goes -- everything refinery in the world has to face this situation because there is \u2013 what do the refineries do. If there is a new refinery, they obviously have to figure out what did they do for their bottom of the barrel. We eager not to gasify and then some people said that it is [indiscernible] most of the refineries have a [indiscernible]. But the [indiscernible] produces 6.5% sulfur coke, which right now is being banned in India. China is turning the ships away because they say this is not the product, this is the waste. So every single refinery in the world in time has to figure out what the hell they're going to do with their 6.5% petcoke. And the only viable solution for that is to gasify. That is why we were so excited about making sure we buy the GE technology because that is very much about that. I don't think that five years from any refinery will be able to sell their petcoke. They just won't be able to do that, and therefore, they have to gasify. So I think the opportunity is significant. And we are quite honestly seeing that.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","On Slide 32, you\u2019re essentially doubling your capital expenditure budget for 2020. And so I was wondering if you could disaggregate some of the major buckets in terms of Jazan? How much have you earmarked for that in the year relative to other growth projects and maintenance that you anticipate?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, the thing is that our maintenance CapEx, as Scott already disclosed that, it's about $400 million. And then with the Jazan, I don't want to disclose the details of what we expect, but the total cash outlay is $2.5 billion, and probably a significant part of it will happen in 2020 depending on when we actually close the transaction. And then the rest of it is our growth CapEx, which is pretty robust. Our fundamental -- if you exclude Jazan, our expenditure on other projects, is actually pretty good and we are very optimistic about that. It's around more than \u2013 yeah, it's around $2.5 billion. Yeah.","Kevin McCarthy","And sticking with the subject of capital deployment, Seifi, I think you\u2019ve indicated that the project pipeline looks quite robust. What are you seeing these days in the M&A pipeline? Is there anything of interest that could be brewing on that front?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, M&A pipeline in terms of us actually buying another industrial gas company around the world, I don't see a lot of debt. But Jazan $12 billion is really an M&A. I mean we are buying these existing assets, so it depends how you want to categorize that. But in terms of buying other industrial gas companies, I don't see much of an opportunity, mainly because of anti-trusting.","Operator","And our next question will be from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","Jim Sheehan","What's the rationale for the Qudra JV? Why not just own this business outright?","Seifi Ghasemi","It's because that \u2013 okay, we plan to do a lot more with ACWA Qudra, so called what we call APQ. Then just the Jazan project. Qudra Energy is part of Aqua Power and people who own that. We have had a very successful joint venture with them. The people are very competent. And we plan to do a lot -- the reason that we have formed that entity is to do a lot more than just Jazan. They are going to be involved before I\u2019ve talked about the Jazan, the hydrogen pipeline that we're going to build, and other projects in Saudi Arabia, and quite honestly other projects in the Middle East. So the rationale for that is a lot bigger than just for Jazan. Therefore, since we have that kind of a relationship with them, we wanted them to be a little bit part of Jazan project to get things started.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you. And regarding your comments on carbon capture, you demonstrated the ability to capture CO2 in your steam methane reformers, in Texas, several years ago. It was a $400 million pilot project, and I think a majority of the project cost recovered by the Department of Energy grant. Are you expecting the federal government to give you more grant money or you\u2019re planning to find it yourself? And also if you could discuss, how much are refinery customers willing to pay for your ability to capture CO2?","Seifi Ghasemi","On that front, these things are happening the way they are happening is, obviously, as you know there is a federal program that for every ton of CO2 that you capture, you can get up to $45 -- $45 or something like that. But then, take a look at what California is doing which I think is going to be the trend worldwide. And that is that, right now, in California, if you capture a ton of CO2, and you can see sequestrate and demonstrate that it wouldn\u2019t leach for 100 years; you get $200 a ton bonus. So we think that the trend will be that difference states will do the same thing, and we are seeing that the same kind of thing is happening in terms of incentives by other governments. We are right now involved in a project for sequestrating CO2 in Europe, actually in the port rather than building your pipeline in order to put the CO2 there and sequestrate. So all of these things are going to be driven, we think, by a pretty substantially incentives from the different governments in order to encourage carbon capture, which is obviously a big issue global.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Thanks. Congrats on a nice quarter and good outlook guys.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, John. I appreciate that.","John Roberts","Seifi, you mentioned India waking up to their coal opportunity. How far away are we from something parallel to your China projects? Is it two or three or five years away for having something big in India?","Seifi Ghasemi","I think that India -- with these projects when the government decides, okay, we're going to do this thing, obviously, you have to identify opportunities, put the project together, do feasibility study and so on. So I think it\u2019s -- from today it\u2019s a five or six years process before you get to equivalent of land or equivalent of Jazan and so on. So that's kind of the timeframe that I see. But quite honestly, same thing we have started something five years ago, we see the benefit of it, if you have started now we see the benefit of it in time, but it will be about, I think, a five year process before you actually have gasification units operating in India. The same thing that happened John within China. China decided to go with gasification in around 2005, 2006, and the units didn't start coming on the scene until about 2011, 2012. Okay?","Operator","And will take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Don [indiscernible] on Bob. I'd say I had to jump on in that with I\u2019ll just start. You owned that GE and Shell technology. Is there an opportunity to get -- to go into, I guess, dozens of operating gasifiers within China, so using that technology and trying to be gasify those assets?","Seifi Ghasemi","That's exactly what we are trying to do. That is an opportunity. I don't know in how many of them will be succeed, but that is exactly what you're trying to do.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then, I guess, sense maybe the technology has evolved, and we're seeing opportunities, I guess, operate those more efficiently?","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard","Looking at the hydrogen, you talked a little bit about outages of your customers. I was wondering if you could give us a range for how much that depressed yourselves. And then on the flip side, as far as you can tell every refiner we've heard has said that they are prepping for IMO, and so there's going to be no outages next year. Is that a material uplift for your volumes next year?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, if that materializes, obviously, it will be, but these refineries are on a cycle that they have to do their shutdown, and some of them will take a shutdown before years and all of that. This is something which is very difficult to predict in terms of how it works out. Obviously, in our plan, we have allowed for some shutdowns, if they don't happen that will be an upside. But I fully expect them to happen and the shutdowns are pretty big deals and the refineries have to do that, otherwise, they take a risk in operation, which they would \u2013 that would have unplanned shutdown, which is not good for anybody.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay. And it looks -- it looks like you pushed the [indiscernible] project out about a year, is that right? And if so why?","Seifi Ghasemi","It is the same thing that we have said before. There are a lot of issues about the so called coal allocation in terms of allocating coal to this project, which we would like to see it done. And as a result, we want to be up upfront the investors about the fact that we announced the memorandum of understanding about something that we thought was going to happen because it was signed with a lot of fanfare and in front of two Presidents and all of that. But there is internal struggle about getting coal allocated to this project. So we pushed it a year, but we are going to give you an update every quarter about this thing, but obviously we are not too excited about the development, as I'm sure, you're not.","Jonas Oxgaard","Maybe just \u2013 want Scott just to make it clumsy.","Scott Crocco","Yeah, and, obviously, Seifi's comments are really referring to the overall project that [indiscernible] is doing. This isn't an issue where the customers proceeding and we have some problem in our project, that's not the situation.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask about the global gases and the corporate segments. Curious what drove the results there to be so much better in Q4 than they were in the other quarters of fiscal '19? And could you possibly give us some guidance for what we should expect in fiscal '20 versus fiscal '19?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, on that front, the main drivers, I think, Simon is the expert on the corporate sector, but, yes, I think is sure of these things. Simon why don't you comment?","Simon Moore","Sure. It's a great question Mike. Thanks. I mean, obviously, as we said for few quarters now, we are excited about the LNG business, and we've announced one order and we believe there we're in good position for others. So that's been a key factor. But I'd also say that, certainly, the corporate sector there were a couple of kind of one-time items. So that's a profit recognition on a sale of equipment is lumpy. So there might be a little bit lumpy going forward, but certainly over the next couple of years, we expect nice improvements in the LNG business.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then other question I had was on the acquisition -- the CO2 acquisition in Europe in the Jinmei asset buyback. Can you breakout what the contribution to revenue was either on a full company basis or in the Europe gases and Asia gases region?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, it\u2019s just small, because they have just started. So we don't give that kind of detail, but it was not significant. It will be better next year, but it was not significant for the quarter.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","I just have two very quick ones. First on the Q-45, is your impression that is the IRS does make a clear ruling on implementation we should expect their products to be able to do flurry of announcements in the near-term or will there be a multiyear lag for projects to be developed? And secondly, given the way you're describing the long-term opportunity set, so the eyeball related opportunity there gasification, the coal gasification and a carbon sequestration, if negative rates continue, how long or is there a point at which merchant ask becomes non-core sale products?","Seifi Ghasemi","Let me answer the second question. Merchant gas will never become non-core. That is an integral part of our business. And no matter how many opportunities there are, we are still focused on that, and that business is growing in China and all of that. So the merchant business locks in all I mean, helium, liquid hydrogen, they are all -- that would always be a core part of our products. But on your first part of the question, I'd like to turn it over to Scott to answer.","Scott Crocco","How but just want to clearly, Laurence, with your question regarding CO2, and the tax situation on it.","Laurence Alexander","Correct. So the IRS ruling on Q-45 that's been delayed, the question is if they do clarify, what the rule is, should we expect what sort of announcement near-term or is it going to take several years to line up agreements?","Scott Crocco","Well, I guess, maybe I think \u2013 Laurence, I think, one thing that Seifi talked about was he talked about a number of local state or provincial programs in various places around the world that also are very supportive of CO2 capture projects. So I think the reality is there's a lot of different situations that we\u2019ll have to see play out, but as Seifi said, we're very excited about this.","Seifi Ghasemi","It's very difficult to predict what will happen without the legislations and so on. But there are a lot of programs, which are in place, and I think that will continue to be the case as we move forward.","Okay. I think that was the last question. And with that, I would like to thank everyone for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We obviously appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day, and Happy Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas.

Welcome to Air Products and Chemicals Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Simon Moore","Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products second quarter 2019 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide Number 2.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate your interest in Air Products and thank you for joining us on our call today. At Air Products, we have a talented, committed and motivated team who stays focused on serving our customers and creating value for our shareholders every day of the year. This team delivered yet another quarter of very strong safety and financial results. I want to thank all of our 16,000 employees for their hard work, dedication and contribution.","Our quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 is up 12% and represents the 20th consecutive quarter, I like to stress that, the 20th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year quarterly EPS growth. This strong result overcame a negative $0.08 currency impact. Our EPS is up 17% on a constant currency basis. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with a record quarterly dividend margin above 37%.","We remain in a very strong financial and technological position with a business that generates significant cash flow. I remain extremely confident of our ability to deploy this capital into high return industrial gas projects that does generate significant value for our shareholders, while also continuing to return cash through our dividend.","Now, please turn to Slide Number 3. All our employees around the world are focused on safety. And as a result, we have improved our loss time injury rate by 83% and our recordable injury rate by 45% since 2014.","Slide number 4 states our long standing goal. Five years ago, we set the goal be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. I am very happy and proud to say that we have achieved this goal and are committed to maintaining our position in the years to come. We expanded the goal to include being the most diverse and that is part of our continuing journey to create a work environment that everyone can achieve their true potential.","Slide Number 5 is my management philosophy that I have followed throughout my business career. And we have talked about this many times before, so I don\u2019t want to dwell on it.","Slide Number 6 shows our 5 point plan for Air Products as we move forward. We are committed to have best-in-class performance to maintain our current leadership position, grow the company by expanding our offering related to our core competencies, continue to change the culture of the company and most important, to achieve our higher purpose. That higher purpose is to create a company that people feel they belong and their contributions are recognized and valued; a company that is committed to sustainability and supportive of the communities in which we operate; a company that our people want to work for where they are proud to be a part of an innovative process to solve the energy and environmental challenges facing the human race. That is our higher purpose and we are committed to it.","Please turn to Slide Number 7, which shows the key milestones in our gasification strategy. Let me take the opportunity to provide an update on a few of these exciting projects. As I said last quarter, the Lu'An project continues to run very well and is contributing to our results as we expected. The Jazan ASU, the main air separation units, they are built on budget and on time and they are in the process of being commissioned as we speak. The definitive contract for the Jazan gasifier and power plants, which are very complex contracts and many of them are being negotiated with Saudi Aramco. And we expect the conclusion of those discussions by the end of calendar 2019.","We are continuing our discussion with YK Group for the very large coal to syngas project. This project is a still underway. And there are some issues related to the allocation of coal, which is very important for us but the project has the support of central government. And we are optimistic that we will have more definitive announcements about the project as we move forward. And for the Juitai project, that project is under construction with expected on stream in 2022. In addition to these announced projects, as we have said before we continue to work on a significant number of very large new gasification opportunities around the world.","Now please go to Slide Number 8, where you can see the results of our key profitability metrics. We remain committed to our goal of continuing to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these metrics.","Now please go to a Slide Number 9, which is always my favorite slide and particularly this quarter. You can see our record quarterly EBITDA margin up 37.7%, which is up over 1,200 basis points from five years ago. This is a great achievement by the people of Air Products and all of us are very proud of it.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss the results in detail. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you very much, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a summary of our Q2 results. As Seifi said, our team delivered another impressive quarter. Volume added 3%, demonstrating the success of our growth strategy. Price was also up 3%, which is our best performance in over four years. Sales of $2.2 billion were up 1% as the better volume and price was roughly offset by 4% negative currency and 2% due to a contract change in India.","As a reminder, we agreed with a customer in India to convert our hydrogen supply agreement into a tolling arrangement. This change has no impact on our profits but reduces sales for the company and for our EMEA segment but we are showing the sales impact in the other line. This change began in December, so the second quarter includes the full quarterly effect. We saw lower sales as we near the end of our successful Jazan sales equipment project. Excluding this impact, volumes grew 5% due to positive base volumes and additional new plant on-streams, including Lu'An in Asia. Price was particularly strong across all three regions and across our merchant product lines. Great job by our team as we stay focused on pricing.","Currency was again a headwind as the dollar strengthened against all major currencies. EBITDA of $825 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 both improved 12%, driven by the higher volumes and positive pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency and higher cost. EBITDA margin reached a record 37.7%, up 340 basis points compared to prior year as a result of higher volume and price, as well as the India contract modification. ROCE of 12.6% improved 80 basis points versus last year, primarily due to higher profits. Sequentially EBITDA increased 4% as better results in Americas and EMEA more than offset reduced Jazan sales equipment and lower volumes due to the lunar New Year holidays in Asia.","Please turn to Slide 11. Our second quarter GAAP EPS was $1.90, and includes a $5 million one-time pension settlement cost. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.92 was up 12% or $0.21 per share, driven by strong operating performance. Volume, price and costs together contributed $0.30.","As you see on this slide, the impact of price increases is shown net of the impact of variable cost rate increases, primarily variable production costs, such as power and distribution costs in our merchant business. The other cost line refers to fixed cost increases, such as personnel and plant maintenance costs. The other cost increase this quarter was driven in part by labor inflation and higher maintenance. And as we've said previously, we continue to see cost associated with investment and our capabilities to successfully win and execute our growth strategy.","Currency and foreign exchange was $0.08 unfavorable, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and the euro. Excluding the unfavorable currency, EPS increased $0.29 or 17% over last year. Non-operating items, including interest expense, non-controlling interest and non-operating income, combined for a negative $0.01. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.9%, roughly flat compared to prior year. For FY19, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 20%.","Now please turn to Slide 12. We continue to generate strong cash flow. During the last 12 months, we generated almost $11 per share or over $2.4 billion of distributable cash flow. This distributable cash flow allowed us to pay almost $1 billion or about 40% as dividends to our shareholders and still have nearly $1.5 billion available for high return investments in our core industrial gas business. This strong cash flow enables us to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.","Slide Number 13 updates our capital deployment progress and we have reformatted the information to hopefully make it more clear for you. As you can see, we now show just over $16 billion of investment capacity available over the five-year period from FY2018 through FY2022. This is made up of the three components, first is additional debt available today. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. If we maintain this rating at a debt level of about 3 times the last 12 months EBITDA, we have about $8.7 billion available today.","Second, based on LTM investible cash flow, we expect to over $5 billion between now and the end of FY2022. Third, we've already deployed almost $2.5 billion on M&A and growth projects. This excludes maintenance CapEx. Today, we have a total of about $7.5 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $6.8 billion remaining to spend on them. Though, you can see we have already spent 15% and already committed well over half of our total available capacity.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. ","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to our Asia results on Slide Number 14. There you can see that our great team in Asia delivered yet another strong set of results. Our China base business recovered well from the Lunar New Year holiday, and continues to show positive growth. And our other strong positions throughout Asia continue to contribute. We remain very focused on our current business and are also very positive about our long-term growth potential in this region.","For the quarter, sales were up 12% from last year as a result of positive volume and price more than offsetting negative currency. Volumes increased 12%, primarily driven by new projects, mostly Lu'An. Overall, pricing for the region was up 5% versus last year, the 8th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price improvement. The strong volume and price also favorably impacted both profits and margins. EBITDA increased by 32% and EBITDA margin improved 700 basis points to a record 47.7%, making Asia our most profitable region. I am very proud of the performance of our team in this region.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to discuss our Americas result. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Americas results. For the quarter, sales increased 9%, primarily driven by 5% higher volume and 3% higher price. Demand for hydrogen was robust in both the Gulf Coast, which is supported by the new Baytown facility in Canada. Our base merchant business also continued to grow in North America, while Latin America remains weak. Overall, this is the ninth consecutive quarter of volume improvement for the region.","Freights contributed a positive 3%, the best performance in over four years. Americas EBITDA of almost $400 million increased 10% and reported EBITDA margins of over 40% were up 60 basis points, primarily driven by higher volumes and pricing. EBITDA margin was up 150 basis points, excluding the impact of higher energy cost pass through. Earlier this week, we announced a new project for our second ASU for Big River Steel in Arkansas. This new ASU will support big River Steel's expansion and the local merchant market, and it builds on the success of our first ASU that came on-stream a few years ago.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?","Simon Moore","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our EMEA results. Our EMEA business produced positive operational results this quarter despite limited economic growth as strong pricing offset negative currency. Compared to last year, price improved 3% while volume held firm. We saw 7% sales impact from unfavorable currency and 9% sales reduction due to the India contract change.","Price improved across all major merchant products and across all sub-regions. The 3% price increase marked the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement. Reported EBITDA of $182 million was up 2% and EBITDA was up 9% on a constant currency basis. Reported EBITDA margin improved 500 basis points. Excluding the India contract change, EBITDA margin was up about 200 basis points. And although we continue to see Brexit as a potential risk to our future results, at this point, we have not seen any significant negative impacts.","Now please turn to Slide 17 Global Gases, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business, as well as central industrial gas business cost. Sales and EBITDA declined due to lower project activity as we approach the conclusion of our very successful Jazan ASU sale of equipment project.","Please turn to Slide 18, corporate segment, which includes LNG and other businesses, as well as our corporate costs. Although, this quarter sales and profit have yet to show improvement, we anticipate a turnaround in the LNG business. We recently announced a major project win to supply our proprietary technology and equipment to the Golden Pass LNG export project in the Gulf coast. Since this is sale of equipments where the revenue and profit are booked based on percentage of completion, we expect this project to contribute to our earnings later in calendar 2019.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon. Please turn to Slide Number 19. Almost five years ago, in July of 2014 during my first conference call with the investment community, I promised to grow the company's earnings per share by at least 10% annually. As you can see, we have done better than that and achieved 13% cumulative average growth rate over the last five years. We have delivered what we promised and more. Thanks to the great team at Air Products. Our goal continues to be, to achieving a cumulative average growth rate of at least 10% in the coming years.","Now that we are talking about the coming years, we do understand that we live in an uncertain world. And we, at Air Products, cannot influence the world's economic or political developments. But we do have control over what Air Products can and should do as a company to react to the changing world. We have a strong, capable and flexible organization, which remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promises to investors as we go forward.","So now for what we promised this year, please turn to Slide Number 20. We are increasing our EPS guidance for fiscal year 2019 to a range of $8.15 to $8.30. Despite currency headwinds at the midpoint, our guidance represents 10% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance. For quarter three of fiscal year 2019, our earnings per share guidance is $2.10 to $2.15, up 8% to 10% over last year. We have also slightly increased our CapEx forecast to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2019.","Our team around the world continues to be excited about Air Products' future. Our five point strategic plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward. And our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation of our continued growth. We have the financial capacity, the technological knowhow and the talent to successfully pursue the exciting opportunities that we see ahead.","And finally, please turn to Slide Number 21. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance. I want to again thank all of our 16,000 employees around the world for their commitment and hard work, and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of winning together. I am very proud to be part of this winning team.","Now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from John McNulty with BMO Capital.","John McNulty","It seems like there's a lot of opportunities in the coal gasification arena. You're certainly highlighting, it sounds like, a lot of projects that you're at least considering. Can you help us to understand how you prioritize or what some of the bigger priorities are when you're picking a partner for these projects as we think about the future investment going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","John, we have always said that when we look at these projects and there are many of them as we said. The very first thing that we do is make an assessment, whether the project is economically viable. That means that if they are making diesel fuel or if they are making olefins, or whatever it is that the end part that is going to come out of this project; how is the market for that product; where is it going to be sold; what are the expected prices; and does the full project make economic sense, that's number one. Once we have satisfied ourselves that that is the case then the second thing that we focus is on the customer that we are dealing with; who is actually doing this project; what is their financial strength; what is their expenses, what is their market position and all of that.","Then if we have passed economic test and passed the market test then quite honestly we do the project unless it is in a very, very, very difficult part of the world, and there are not that many of them. So the basic message that I have is that we don\u2019t look at the projects like, oh, this project is in China, we don\u2019t want to do it or this project is in India, we don\u2019t look at that. We look at what is the project and whom is it for. I have said many times if you give me a project that makes economical sense and it is for Saudi Aramco, we will do it no matter where it is in the world. So those are the criterias that we follow.","John McNulty","And then I guess when you look at the projects out there, I think last quarter you'd highlighted there were 50-plus projects out there that you were at least evaluating. What portion of those are projects that are already up and running where the actual producer is saying, \"You know what, we'd rather outsource this,\" similar to what we saw with the refining industry back, I don't know, 20, 30 years ago as they started kind of outsourcing the business. So how should we be thinking about that and the opportunities there?","Seifi Ghasemi","Probably 10% to 20% of them are in that category.","Operator","Next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Kieran on for Chris. Congratulations on the good quarter. I was wondering if you can discuss the trends that you're seeing in APAC, particularly in China. I mean, are there any key end markets that you are you seeing slower accelerate. Then also just regarding this quarter, any impact you saw from the Lunar New Year and how we should think about volumes in the sequential basis?","Seifi Ghasemi","With respect in China, I've said this many times, we don\u2019t see any particular weakening in any -- at least -- we had exposure to a lot of the businesses. And one of the interesting thing about our business that you know very well is that we don\u2019t have any inventory. So our performance is instantaneous whatever the economy is doing you see that in our numbers. China is going very well. And a Lunar New Year, China this year we were very concerned about that and that's why we were conservative in our guidance for the quarter. The Chinese New Year, although, it fell in between these, it went down and came back exactly like every other year and the economy is doing very well and we continue to be very optimist. We are very bullish on China.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just when I look at your full-year guidance, it implies a very strong fourth quarter, little bit stronger I think than like the third quarter. Maybe can you just discuss the key elements that are driving that positive outlook for the fourth quarter and then for the back half of the year? I appreciate it thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","First of all, we expect that the pricing momentum that we have seen would continue and actually might become even better than what we have seen before. So that is one thing that keeps us optimistic. The other thing is that Brexit is delayed until October, so we don\u2019t expect any significant negative effects on that. The other thing is that our LNG project business, as you know, this is not contributing anything. But we did win a very big project, Golden Pass in Texas. And since with that project, we have start getting paid as soon as we started working on it, we expect some contribution from that. And the fourth thing is that we expect that the effect of negative currency to be a little bit better. And you put all of that together that is what makes us optimistic that we would be able to meet the higher end of, or at least our goal is to meet the higher end of our forecast, which is [indiscernible]","Operator","The next question comes from line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Just on the merchant pricing, can you go through the merchant price gains you realized in each of the three major regions?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, David, you know our business better than anybody and you know that half of our business is on site and there is not a lot of price increase in there. So as a rule of thumb, you can take the numbers that we have given you for each region, multiply it by two and you end-up with what we achieved in the merchant business. And you see that it is a strong -- it\u2019s a 7%, 8%, 11% in the different regions.","David Begleiter","And just on YK projects, Seifi, any concerns on your part given the elongated timeline to finalize the details here?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, I don\u2019t have any concern. That project is a project that has a strong support of the central government. The central government wants that to happen. The issue is the allocation of coal to that project. That is a very important issue for us, because we don't want to do any big gasification project when the source of coal is not 100% guaranteed. I mean YK is a big coal company but they need to get allocation of the coal. So the negotiation with that is taking longer than what we expected, but I fully expect that project to go forward. The timing might be a little bit different than what we expect today. But I think that that is a good project, it makes a lot of sense and it will eventually happen.","Operator","Next we'll go to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Mike Leithead","This is actually Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. I guess to follow-up on the pricing dynamics. Nice acceleration this quarter. I was hoping you can maybe give a sense of where you think merchant operating rates are today, particularly in North America and Asia?","Seifi Ghasemi","Sure. North America operating rates are in about mid-70s. The operating rates in Europe are around in the low 80s. And the operating rate in the areas that we operate in Asia is about in mid-80s.","Mike Leithead","And then on the LNG market. It seems like activity and optimism is starting to pick-up in that area. I was hoping you could maybe characterize outside of the project you just signed, where do you think overall market dynamics will start to be a tailwind as we get to the back of this year or maybe that's closer to a 2020 event?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, in 2019, our fiscal year ends at the end of September. So we did have a positive impact from the Golden Pass project, but that's not going to be huge. But as we go forward, we are very optimistic about that business. As you know that business use to make us $50 million of EBITDA a year, and today it's making nothing. So we think that in time we will get to that $150 million rate in the next three, four years. We are very optimistic about the LNG business that's why we never considered divesting of it. We have a huge technological advantage. Almost 70% -- 75% of all the large LNG projects use our technology, and we see many of them happening in the U.S. and around the world. So we continue to -- we expect a very positive future for that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","The EBITDA margin in Asia is now roughly 48%, and maybe a year-ago it was 38%. Is the difference in the margin, the Lu'An project essentially?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, the fact is a significant amount of that is also, Lu'An is obviously affecting it. But there is obviously the fact that we have gotten significant pricing. I mean, our mission pricing in last quarter was 11% ahead of last year. So that is a very positive contributor. And beside that our people there are doing a good job in productivity and keeping the cost under control. So overall, as I said I'm very proud of what they have done. And I'm optimistic that we have been eager to maintain that kind of a margin as we go forward.","Jeff Zekauskas","For the Jazan gasifier in the power JV, I think you said earlier in the call that you're trying to negotiate the final terms by the end of the year. If you successfully negotiate those terms, when would that project begin to affect your income statement?","Seifi Ghasemi","If we successfully complete the negotiations by the end of the year and financially close that project will contribute in 2019 and then obviously in 2020, and then the big impact will be in 2021. But it will definitely impact 2019 it'd be completed by the end of fiscal year this year.","Operator","And we'll go to John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Pricing was largely offset by foreign exchange. I guess in once sense you could say that pricing in dollar terms was roughly flat year-over-year. Do you think pricing in currency are completely unrelated, or do think the exchange rates are giving you a little bit more ability to price in local currency?","Seifi Ghasemi","The currency has nothing to do with it our business is absolutely low cost. And whether the dollar is up or down, it has no effect on our ability to increase the lower prices in different parts of the board. This is not like crude oil or anything like that. So it is totally independent, John.","John Roberts","And then I know it's too early to have a CapEx budget for 2020, but since we're halfway through fiscal '19. At this point, do you know whether 2020 will be up or stable with the 2019 CapEx budget?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, I expect our 2020 CapEx will be probably north of $2 billion.","Operator","Now we'll next go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","Jim Sheehan","Can you comment on the ACP Europe acquisition, about how much did you pay for that and how much earnings contribution will it represent?","Seifi Ghasemi","The amount that we take for that, I think we have disclosed that. It's about more than $100 million. And obviously the rule of thumb that we always tell you is if you spend $100 million that should give us operating income of $10 million.","Operator","Now we'll next go to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort","Seifi, you talked about gasification business about prioritize your project load there. And I guess if we look at breakeven levels for maybe making glycol or olefins, or fertilizer we're easily there. When Brent starts to get up in the $75 range then maybe coal to fuels or coal to synthetic natural gas comes in play. In that project portfolio that you're pursuing, are you seeing greater interest in those, maybe higher breakeven type applications to gasification?","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes.","Robert Koort","And are those exclusively in China, or are they more broad globally?","Seifi Ghasemi","As the price of oil goes up, the number of projects that we come by obviously becomes big. So you are right on that.","Robert Koort","Can I ask you on the de-cap side, Seifi, I think there has been over the last couple of years, there has been some shareholder frustration expressed about deploying that capital and now you're starting to do that more aggressively. Is there a de-cap opportunity here in gasification? I know Shell, when they own the business, certainly advertise the process improvements they've made overtime -- the history and portfolio of gasifiers they have in operation gave them an advantage. Is there an ability to go to speak to existing gasifiers and suggest you can operate them better with improvements in technology? Or how would you -- what will be the selling points that you'd make to an existing gasification customer to maybe let you take that off their hands and operate it?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, Bob, I mean you are exactly accurate in terms of the argument we will use. And quite frankly, the very best example of what you just said is the IGCC project in Saudi Arabia, the Jazan project that we are talking about. We went to Saudi Aramco and that we have improvements in the Shell technology. And they are all using shale technology for gasifying the bottom of the refinery, and that is asset buyback. So that is an ideal example of what you're talking about. And there are others like that that obviously we are pursuing.","Operator","Now we'll go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on for Vincent. So just a quick question around the gasification projects. So with the explosion that happened in the fertilizer plant in China, I was wondering has anything changed in terms of the number of projects you are seeing. Obviously, you're very bullish on that. But maybe you can give us an update on the 50 plus project number that you mentioned earlier, and just how that explosion is impacting that number?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, first of all that explosion has nothing to do what we are doing. It has no impact.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess, I mean just more from a regulatory perspective in terms of -- I guess, new projects, whether it's in olefins or anything else. I guess you are not seeing any impact from that is what you are saying?","Seifi Ghasemi","That's correct.","Unidentified Analyst","And then maybe just as a quick follow-up just on CapEx. I was wondering if you could give us some color as to what drove that, increasing the CapEx for 2019.","Seifi Ghasemi","In 2019, I think that Scott can answer that.","Scott Crocco","I think you are referring to taking up the bottom of the range from [Multiple Speakers], it's just that we're half way through the year, better estimates of the spending and some other smaller projects that we're spending on.","Unidentified Analyst","And then if I may just one quick follow-up as well. You have volumes obviously. You had tough comps there last year. But as I look at the next couple of quarters just curious as to your -- what will you view volume there going for the next couple of quarters?","Seifi Ghasemi","I'm not sure quite honestly I understood the question.","Unidentified Analyst","Just what your expectations and volume are for your -- it's actually for the coming quarters.","Seifi Ghasemi","For just Europe or for everywhere else in general\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","For Europe\u2026","Seifi Ghasemi","For Europe, we expect the run rate to continue. We are not, as I said, the Brexit delayed, we are not concerned about volumes in Europe and we remain positive about pricing in Europe.","Operator","Next question comes from line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","I want to go to your favorite slide, Slide Number 9, new record on EBITDA margin 37.7%. How much of that was due to -- what's the impact to that India conversion the tolling on that? And I assume that most of your upward momentum in EBITDA margins due to price. So are we at an inflection point in pricing here? Traditionally, you didn\u2019t get pricing in this industry till you're well into the 80s, but you seem to be getting pricing earlier. So I guess the final question is you used to think 35% of EBITDA margin was a normalized level. So is 37%, 38% the new normal?","Seifi Ghasemi","The number one is that the effect of the -- it's about 80 basis points in terms of India, that\u2019s number. The second thing is that with respect to where would the EBITDA margin be, I've always told people from way back that when you're modeling Air Products, model an EBITDA margin of 35% to 36%. And I would still suggest that. We did do very well this quarter. We will see what the next quarter brings. But I don\u2019t want to start predicting that we will hit 37.7% every quarter. But I think it is safe to assume that we will be around 35% on average.","Don Carson","And on pricing, do you think we're at an inflection point here where the improvements you've seen in merchant pricing is sustainable? Again, you seem to be getting the pricing at lower rates than you historically needed to get pricing?","Seifi Ghasemi","Don, I heard your question and I was trying to maybe not answering it. You know that we don\u2019t like to make any comments on pricing considering the nature of our industry. So you need to let me off the hook of that.","Operator","Now we'll go to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","For these large coal gasification projects that are now in your backlogs. What fraction of that total installed equipment would you say is going to be fabricated at one of your locations versus field fabrication? And do you expect that shift change overtime as you get more and more of these projects under your belt and be able to develop more of a capability to fabricate at a central location and lower your capital costs, time to erect and competitiveness?","Seifi Ghasemi","Let me answer them one at a time. With respect to -- with these coal gasifications, the part that we make ourselves is the air separation unit, the main coal boxes. Those coal boxes are manufactured right now exclusively mostly in China. So as we expand, we have expanded our operation in China, in Caojing, south of Shanghai. As we expand, we continue to expand that facility. And if we get to a stage that we need additional capacity, we know where to go. So that is -- with the rest of these coal gasification facilities, we do not manufacture them ourselves, a lot of them are engineered and designed and built at the drop site. And they are prefabricated at different locations and brought together and assembled together like an electro set. So there is no constraint on our ability to manufacture these.","Steve Byrne","Just like some furnaces are fabricated and then shipped to a job site. Could you anticipate the gasifier units being moved in that direction and ultimately reducing the total capital costs for these projects?","Seifi Ghasemi","The capital costs for these projects, depending on where they are, can significantly be reduced if you break down the projects like we did in Jazan, and pre-fabricate them at the most cost effective area. When you look at Jazan, and hopefully we can show you a movie of it on time. You see that it was like an erector set. We had 450 ton unit of all of the piping manufactured actually in China, which was the lowest cost, and then it was shipped and then put together with the rest of the plan. So we did a lot -- we did not do a lot of the cutting and building and all of that in Jazan, which would have been very expensive. So that is what you do in terms of trying to reduce the cost. There air separation part, which is about usually on these big project is, separation part is about 10% of the cost that one we manufacture it in several pieces in Caojing and then ship to the job site and put it together.","Steve Byrne","And just lastly out of your 16,000 employees, what fraction would you say are involved in engineering and construction?","Seifi Ghasemi","About more than 20% on engineering, the construction, the actual construction when we are building a plant like Jazan, we have construction supervision people. And just to give you a number for Jazan when we were building it, we had about 200 of our people supervising it but the number of people who are actually building the plant they're 6,000. Those people, we hired locally for the project. They are not permanent employees. Out of the 16,000, about 20% are dedicated engineering and project management people that we have and they are long-term employees of Air Products and we are very proud of it.","Operator","Next we go to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Seifi, I was wondering if you could comment on the nature and level of competitive intensity in the gasification arena, specifically and anecdotally it would seem that some of your competitors have a different strategy in terms of their focus. Curious if you survey your 50 plus projects there. How often are you running into the other global majors? And to what degree is the customer source of competition in a sense for you?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, you are asking me a very difficult question, I don\u2019t know how to answer that, because I obviously am in no position to speak for our competitors. If their strategy is that they are not optimistic about these projects, I hope they continue to follow that strategy. I really cannot comment on behalf of our customers that when they are dealing with us, how many other people they are talking and all of that. We always behave as if we have competition, and we try to give the very best offer that we can to our customers. So that's the extent that I want to comment on this.","Operator","Next we'll go to P. J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar","So my question on crude to chemicals projects that are being discussed around the world. Do you have any technology there similar to your gasification technology? And if not, they will still consume lot of gases. So what are you seeing or hearing about request of bids for ASUs for those projects?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I think on all of those projects, people would be looking for this for ASUs. We are trying to differentiate ourselves, but making an offer to the customers that we provide you, not only the ASU but also the gasification. And therefore, a different package rather than just competing for the ASU, which most of the time if the customer want to buy the ASUs by themselves, they usually do sale of equipment rather than sale of gas. And as you see, most of the current existing gasifiers in China, which there are many, have all been sale of equipment. So we are trying to differentiate ourselves by getting a bigger package. But if the customer insist that no, I just want a bit for the air separation unit, we usually -- depending on who the customer is, we usually give them a bid, because I'll be happy to build air separation unit. But we are trying to differentiate ourselves by giving the bigger package to the customer.","P. J. Juvekar","And then a question on Europe, your pricing has lagged there in the past. Now you are getting some solid 6% merchant pricing. And I know in the past you walked away from some low margin businesses in Europe. What are you seeing from new players that were created recently in merchant business in Europe? And there is also a new merchant player in the U.S. What kind of behavior are you seeing from them?","Seifi Ghasemi","It's too soon for us to comment on that. Quite honestly, we usually don\u2019t comment on that anyway, but these people have been in business for a few months. So it's very difficult to make an assessment on that. But you said the key thing, P. J. and I said this publicly in February at a conference. The reason we are getting the pricing is because we are willing to walk away from volume, that is the key thing that we are saying that our costs have gone up and all of that, this is the price of our product, if the customer wants to go buy from somebody else, they can. And the willingness to walk away from low margin business is what is giving us the ability to increase the prices. Otherwise, we will never increase prices. So that is a different strategy for us. That's exactly right.","Operator","We'll next go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Mike Sison","When you think about your 10% growth, EPS growth goal, you've got Jazan gasifier coming on next year and looks like four projects on that one slide. Could 2020 be -- given those projects coming on, could 2020 be a year where you maybe outpace that goal?","Seifi Ghasemi","We always say that -- we always promise them what we can deliver and usually deliver more than what we promise. So, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself. But I hope what you're saying would turn out to be true.","Mike Sison","And then just one quick one on Asia again, margins very good, actually pretty sweet. If you think about the second half of the year, do you think that you can sustain that level? And then what impacts that margin going forward given 48% is pretty impressive level?","Seifi Ghasemi","I expect our EBITDA margins in Asia to continue to be at around those numbers.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll next go to Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Harrison","I wanted to go at the pricing question a little bit differently. I wanted ask specifically about China. Can you comment on what you're seeing in LOX\/LIN supply and demand dynamics in the areas that you play in China? Just trying to get a sense of how sustainable the pricing momentum could be there?","Seifi Ghasemi","Mike, as I mentioned before, the operating rates in the regions that we operate in China is getting to around mid-80s. And when you get to mid-80s then you do have pricing power. So our loss in pricing has been going up. And if the economy stays the way and the operating rates stays the way it is, which I think it will, because nobody is building a brand new plant right away. So I expect that we would continue to have good momentum.","Mike Harrison","And then I was also wondering about -- in your appendix there, you have a number of projects that were listed as starting-up during the first quarter of fiscal '19, two of them in Korea, two of them in the U.S. I was just wondering, did we see a full contribution from all four of those projects during the fiscal second quarter or are some of them still ramping-up?","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes, we do.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard","I was wondering, you had some pretty hefty currency headwinds there. But do you get any currency tailwinds on the CapEx side from this?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, you are there, I guess to some extent we do. I mean the dollar content of a lot of the projects that we make is not that huge but, we do get a tailwind from that, you are right.","Jonas Oxgaard","And is that reflected in your guidance? Can you help me size the impact and how that's reflected in your guidance?","Seifi Ghasemi","The fact that the capital cost of the projects will go down, and that is minutiae, it's not material to our numbers. As we go forward, we expect the headwind on the currency to subside a little bit than you go quarter-by-quarter. So as Scott was telling me before the call, we expect that for next quarter the headwind will be less than $0.08 and hopefully for the quarter after that less than that. Obviously, none of us can predict what will happen to the currencies and all of that. But if the currency rates stay about the same, we should have not as much of a headwind in the third quarter. But Scott can amplify on that.","Scott Crocco","If you just want to build on and see as we've said we've got $0.08 unfavorable here in this quarter. For the year, our projection is maybe $0.15 to $0.20 headwind. And just as a reminder, the way that we look at this is when we come out of the quarter, we don't try to project where rates are going to go, we just hold them steady to where they are. And when you compare them the third quarter versus prior year third quarter and the fourth quarter versus prior fourth quarter, we don't see -- as Seifi just mentioned, we don't see the third quarter to be as much as $0.08, down a little bit. And then even less in the fourth quarter, not because we're projecting a change in exchange rate, but rather just where were rates last year, so just want to get on that.","And again, as we've mentioned earlier in the call, we're talking all translation. There is no economic impact, it's just math bringing it back. So just figured I take it through. And lastly since I'm on this subject, given sensitivities in the past around swings in currencies of 10% for the R&D on an annual basis, a swing of 10% would be about $0.12. For the euro, swing of 10% would be about $0.09. And then there is a basket of other currencies, like the pound, Korean won, Taiwanese dollar and the Canadian dollar. Each it just move them by 10%, it's about $0.03 to $0.04 each. And what I've just given you there is roughly when you throw in the U.S. dollar sales approach at 85% to 90% of the company. So I just figured I take it through some of those numbers.","Jonas Oxgaard","As a follow-up -- so the take or pays that you're signing. Do you usually sign them in dollars or local currency?","Seifi Ghasemi","It depends -- in some countries, it\u2019s in local currencies; in some countries, it\u2019s in dollar terms' depending on the country and how we feel about the customer and their expectation of currency.","Jonas Oxgaard","And if you take China coal as the biggest one, that sways the future?","Seifi Ghasemi","In China, the contracts that we have are in Reminbi in local Chinese.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Dan Rizzo","This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. I'm sorry if I missed this. But did you quantify the backlog and how it has changed this quarter?","Seifi Ghasemi","Simon, you want to -- since you prepared the slide, do you want to make any comment?","Simon Moore","As we said, our total project commitments are about $7.5 billion. I think that's up from around $7 billion last time. And again just to be clear on that that's the total value of the commitments we have. What we have remaining to spend on those is about $6.8 billion.","Dan Rizzo","And then just one other question. Could the gasification evolve to where we see large take-or-pay arrangements rather than JVs in some regions?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, right now the gasification project, some of them is JVs and some of them is 100% ourselves like [indiscernible]\u2026","Scott Crocco","If I could just add, they are all take-or-pay, so just to be clear about that\u2026","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes, whether it's JV or not, it's all take-or-pay.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, we have run over the time. And since there are no other questions, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the very best. Thank you again.","Operator","And that does conclude today's call.

Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Second Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our CEO; and Scott Crocco, our CFO.  After our remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions.","We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website.","Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to John.","John E. McGlade","Thanks, Simon. Before we take you through the details, let me make several overview remarks. While there were some bright spots, the second quarter was certainly a challenge given the softening of the global economy. Our earnings did come within guidance, but slower-than-expected economic growth and a weak electronics market resulted in lower volumes than we had anticipated. We expect this slow growth environment to continue for some time and are no longer anticipating that stronger second half economic improvement as we had originally planned for. Most importantly, we continue to stay focused on actions within our control.","We completed the European restructuring provision that we announced last year on schedule and with the full benefits achieved. We remain focused on execution and continue to drive improvement through cost discipline and productivity. As a result, we saw a good cost performance again this quarter, helping to offset the weaker volume. Over the long term, we are well positioned to grow via our $3 billion project backlog, which is over 80% Onsite\/Pipeline business with long-term take-or-pay contract terms, and we've continued to be successful signing new business. In February, we announced another oxygen order for coal gasification in China for Lu\u2019An Mining and just last week, another LNG order from PETRONAS in Malaysia.","In our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials businesses, we have a tremendous opportunity to load our existing assets when the economy does improve, and our cash priorities remain unchanged. Invest in core projects that have good returns; increase the dividend each year, which we've done now for 31 consecutive years, having announced an 11% increase in March; strive to maintain an A bond rating; and repurchase shares, which you saw us do in Q1 for $460 million. In addition, let me assure you we will continue to take decisive actions to improve our operation and deliver value to shareholders regardless of economic condition.","Now let me turn the call over to Scott to review our results.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 3. As we look back at this past quarter, the economy came in at the low end of what we anticipated when I provided you with our guidance in January. March volumes were a disappointment relative to the normal historical uptick we typically see to this month.","Moving around the globe. In North America, we experienced modest growth. Europe sunk deeper into recession, with Southern Europe remaining particularly weak, while the Northern continent and Central Europe worsened. And in Asia, there was a lower-than-expected ramp up after the Lunar New Year holiday. As I'm sure you've heard from other sources, the electronics industry has remained soft. We have seen new fab construction delays, and the outlook for silicon processing has been reduced significantly. MSI forecasts are now flat to down for our fiscal 2013 versus previous forecasts of 4% to 6% growth. For Air Products, both electronics materials and equipment sales were below our expectations. The pricing environment has held up to date, but is increasingly more difficult due to softer volumes. However, we continued to deliver good cost performance. As a result, we delivered EPS within the range provided in January. With that backdrop, let me take you through our overall results.","For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were 6% higher versus prior year, with the Indura and DA Nano acquisitions contributing 6%. On an underlying basis, sales were down 2% due to our previously announced decision to exit the Polyurethane Intermediates or PUI business. Excluding PUI, higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases segment and higher equipment segment sales were offset by lower volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant segments. Sequentially, overall sales declined 3%, primarily due to lower volumes in our Tonnage segment as a result of planned customer maintenance outages. Simon will provide additional segment and geographic details later.","Operating income of $390 million increased 4% versus prior year and increased 5% sequentially. Our operating margin of 15.7% was down 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily on acquisitions and higher pension expense, partially offset by better cost performance. Sequentially, our margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to last quarter's inventory revaluation and cost improvement. Net income and diluted earnings per share were up 3% and 5%, respectively, versus last year. Our return on capital employed at 10.9% was lower due to our higher capital spending, acquisitions and the lower asset loadings.","Turning to Slide 4. You can see an overview of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.37 increased $0.06 or 5% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.07, including $0.06 from acquisitions. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.04 due to higher energy and distribution cost primarily in our Merchant business. Net cost performance was $0.07 favorable despite a $0.03 unfavorable pension impact. Base business costs were positive, primarily due to the impact of our European cost reduction and improved operating efficiencies. Also, our other income and expense P&L line item typically averages about $10 million to $12 million of income per quarter.","This quarter's results were a bit higher than average as they include a gain of about $0.02 from an asset sale. Excluded from the volume and cost lines is the net $0.02 unfavorable impact from our decision to exit the PUI business. Currency translation and foreign exchange, taken together, were $0.02 unfavorable as we experienced a small FX loss this year compared with a small FX gain last year. Equity affiliate income contributed $0.01 on a continued strong results from our Mexican affiliate. Noncontrolling interest was $0.01 lower due to the addition of Indura. Interest expense was $0.02 higher due to acquisitions and last quarter's share repurchases.","The tax rate was unchanged versus last year. We now expect our tax rate for the year to come in between 24% and 25%, slightly lower than previous guidance. And finally, lower shares outstanding contributed $0.02.","Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of $1 billion were up 14% versus prior year driven by the Indura acquisition. Underlying sales were down 1% on 2% lower volumes and 1% positive price. Volume weakness was most apparent in lower demand in Europe and in helium due to supply limitations globally. Sales were down 1% sequentially. Underlying sales were down 1% on flat pricing and 1% lower volumes due to helium and the Lunar New Year in Asia.","Helium production was lower in the U.S. and Algeria driven by operational challenges with our helium feedstock suppliers. We expect these issues to improve in our third quarter.","Going forward, we expect supply from our Wyoming facility by the end of our fiscal year and further Qatar supply to the industry into early next year. We are also actively developing additional new sources and expect to be able to make a specific announcement soon. However, we expect supply to remain tight over the next few years until this longer-term capacity can be brought on stream.","Merchant Gases operating income of $168 million was up 10% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.8% was down 50 basis points compared to last year and essentially flat sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on profits from the Indura acquisition and improved productivity, including the benefits from our Europe cost reduction programs. As Scott mentioned, we also saw a $0.02 benefit in merchant from an asset sale. This was partially offset by lower volumes and higher energy and distribution costs that were not fully recovered with price increases.","Overall, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the Indura business. We have delivered on the expected synergies with good cost performance and are seeing growth opportunities in small on-sites for a variety of end markets. As we expected and said in the past, given Indura's business mix, their margins are in the low double digits. As a result, for the quarter, Indura negatively impacted segment margins by about 80 basis points. Excluding the Indura impact, segment margins were up 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily on improved productivity. Versus prior quarter, we did see the impact of lower seasonal volumes in Asia with a slower post-Lunar New Year recovery.","Let's look at the business -- the Merchant business by region, please turn to Slide 6. In U.S.\/Canada, sales were down 1% on 2% lower volumes and 1% higher price. As I mentioned, helium supply remained a challenge this quarter accounting for the negative volume variance.","Liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen volumes were up on strengthened metals processing and primary materials. Liquid argon volumes were down on lower demand. Contract signings were solid and lost business was minimal. LOX\/LIN capacity utilization remained in the low 70s. Pricing continues to be favorable led by helium but overall did not fully recover recent power and distribution cost increases. We continue to work hard on pricing and you probably saw that we announced a price increase just last week.","In Europe, sales were down 5% versus last year on lower volumes across most markets, particularly food, metals and construction. Regionally for LOX\/LIN, while the U.K., Ireland and Southern Europe continued to decline, we did see an even more significant drop-off in the northern continent and Central Europe, particularly Poland. And for packaged gases, we saw declines across Europe, but particularly in central and southern Europe.","Overall pricing was flat with some pressure on liquid products offset by positive helium pricing. LOX\/LIN plant loadings were in the mid-70s. The new contract signings were up significantly versus last year as the team leveraged the integration of our liquid bulk and packaged gas sales teams in Europe.","In Asia, sales were up 4% versus last year. Underlying sales were up 2% on flat volumes and 2% higher price. Currency had a positive 2% effect. LOX\/LIN volumes were up across the region and up mid-single digits in China. Liquid argon volumes continue to be weak across the region on lower PV and fabrication demand. Cylinder volume growth was moderated by customer profitability actions, and we continue to see good growth in our Microbulk product line. Pricing was up 2% primarily on helium strength as we are seeing some price pressure in the liquid oxygen and nitrogen business, particularly in China. Plant loadings were made in the mid-70s. Additional capacity will continue to impact loadings over the next few quarters despite the volume growth, and new contract signings for the quarter were the best in years.","Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $809 million were up 3% versus last year on new plant volumes and higher energy passthrough, partially offset by lower PUI volumes. As expected, base volumes were relatively flat as plant customer maintenance outages in Europe were mostly offset by stronger U.S. Gulf Coast volumes. We are proceeding with the exit of our Polyurethane Intermediates business. For the quarter, PUI sales were down about $50 million versus prior year, and operating income was down about $5 million. For the full year, we expect PUI sales to be down about $160 million and operating income to be down about $25 million, more than expected due to higher shutdown costs and lower volumes.","For the segment, sequentially, sales were down 10% on 8% lower volumes ex-PUI. As expected, planned customer maintenance outages and lower spot volumes impacted sales. Operating income of $123 million was down 2% versus prior year. Ex-PUI, operating income of $117 million was up 3% on stronger new plant volumes and improved plant efficiencies. Operating income was down 11% sequentially on lower volumes and higher maintenance costs due to the expected outages. Operating margin of 15.2% was down 80 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to bonus timing and the higher energy cost passthrough. Margin declined 20 basis points sequentially on the lower volumes.","We are pleased to have announced a new long-term agreement with Shanxi Lu'An mining, a large provincial state-owned coal mining company. We will supply over 10,000 tons per day of oxygen, as well as nitrogen, air and steam to their coal gasification project in Shanxi Province, China. Lu\u2019An will use the oxygen to gasify coal and produce diesel fuel. Including the Lu\u2019An project, we are now executing 7 projects to supply oxygen for coal gasification in China, totaling over 38,000 tons per day, all under long-term contracts with take-or-pay terms. Great success by the team, and we continue to see strong bidding activity in this growing market.","We also have seen strong project development activity in the global hydrogen business. Customer are making decisions, and we expect to have more to say on this in the near future.","Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $549 million were down 3% versus last year, with lower base electronics volumes partially offset by the DA Nano acquisition. Sequentially, sales were flat. Versus prior year, electronic sales were down 3% with the DA Nano acquisition, partially offsetting lower equipment sales in an overall weaker materials market. The lower equipment sales are not surprising given the slowdown in new fab CapEx, but we do expect this to rebound by the end of the year.","Tonnage continues to show growth with new projects coming on stream. In the more advanced materials, we continue to see customer adoption of our solutions, creating growth opportunities even in the weak market. However, for the more mature process materials, we are seeing volumes impacted by lower fab utilization and competitive activity impacting both volumes and prices driven by the much lower outlook for the rest of 2013. Sales were down 5% sequentially primarily on lower equipment sales.","Performance Materials sales were down 3% versus last year on both volume and price impacts. While the auto market remains consistent, we have seen weakness globally in construction, industrial coatings and particularly marine coatings. Prices were down slightly more than costs. Sequentially, PMD sales were up 7% on seasonal improvement, particularly in Europe and North America.","Operating income of $78 million was down 9% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 100 basis points to 14.1%. Operating income and margin were impacted by lower volumes and price pressure. Sequentially, operating income was up 26% and operating margin was up 290 basis points, primarily due to the inventory revaluation last quarter.","Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $124 million were up 12% versus prior year and up 17% sequentially primarily on higher LNG project activity. Operating income of $21 million more than doubled prior year and prior quarter on the higher LNG project activity and lower development spending. This is consistent with the guidance we provided for significant improvement in the business for 2013. The backlog of $326 million is up 5% over last year and down 16% versus last quarter as new orders in Q2 were modest, but bidding activity remains strong. As an example of the strong LNG activity, we just announced a new order with PETRONAS in Malaysia last week to support the expansion of their Bintulu LNG complex. This is the second order we announced with PETRONAS over the last year following the floating LNG project announced last July. We would expect additional LNG announcements through the rest of the year.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 10 and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. Given the weakness we saw coming out of fiscal Q2, we are tempering our expectations for economic growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Manufacturing output has slowed globally, and we now expect a more muted recovery off this lower base. As a result, we think it is appropriate to reduce our full year EPS guidance to $5.45 to $5.60.","In the U.S., slower growth in manufacturing output is expected to come in at the low end of our range. Uncertainty in the economy remains and unresolved fiscal challenges may impact the recovery.","In Europe, the recession worsened during Q2 due to widespread austerity programs and high unemployment. We now expect Europe and particularly the countries, where we have higher exposure, to so show negative year-over-year growth in manufacturing for FY '13.","In Asia, we expect a gradual acceleration in manufacturing growth to continue, benefiting from more stimulus spending on infrastructure projects, particularly in China and Korea.","And in South America, Chilean manufacturing was strong in January but slowed through the rest of the quarter. We expect the year to be consistent with our original expectations. Our backlog is back up to $3 billion, primarily from the addition of the Lu'An coal project. We still see a number of outstanding opportunities in the oxygen for coal gasification market in China and in hydrogen projects around the world, but continue to see decisions being delayed on electronics projects.","Based on the strong backlog of projects, we signed long-term contracts with take-or-pay terms. CapEx is expected to be about $2 billion this year, consistent with our most recent guidance. And as I mentioned, we now expect our tax rate for the year to come in between 24% and 25%. For Q3, our EPS guidance is $1.33 to $1.38 based on the following factors.","On the positive side, we expect to see improved sequential volumes in our Merchant and Performance Material businesses, slightly improved economic activity in seasonality, as well as improved volumes in our Tonnage Gasses segment due to less planned customer outages. Partially offsetting the sequential improvement, we expect a lower level of activity in our Equipment and Energy segment similar to the level that we saw in fiscal Q1 with an uptick in Q4, a greater impact from the PUI business exit, and we expect further headwinds from higher pension settlement costs and lower gains from asset sales.","Now let me turn it over to John.","John E. McGlade","Thanks, Scott. As I reflect on the first half of fiscal year '13, Air Products delivered earnings growth in a very challenging economic environment, where our base volume growth was well below what we had anticipated. This earnings growth is a result of the actions we have taken to tackle things within our control, with a particular focus on reducing costs, driving productivity and disciplined project execution. We also repurchased $460 million in shares in the first half of the year and raised our dividend 11%. You have seen us take a number of steps to optimize our portfolio over the last year, including selling our European Homecare business, exiting the PUI business and restructuring our PV market position. And in light of the continuing slow growth environment, we are actively assessing whether there are additional actions we can take that would result in increased value to our shareholders.","In closing, I believe Air Products remains well positioned to deliver increased shareholder value. We have a strong backlog of projects. We have significant leverage on our existing assets that leave us well positioned for recovery, and we remain sharply focused on productivity, improving our core businesses and delivering on our cash priorities. Thank you, and now we are happy to take your questions. Alicia?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess 2 quick questions. First, given the current outlook, can you give a little bit more of a sense on the restructuring in Europe? I mean, and how much more you might need to do to see significant margin improvement there if demand doesn't recover? And secondly, with the slower demand environment this year, does that change the way you think about how much of a backlog-related tailwind you should have next fiscal year because some of the projects that come on stream this year would fully -- would be ramping up with a bit of a lag?","John E. McGlade","Thank you, yes. Laurence, this is John. On your first question, as we noted, we did complete the restructuring in Europe on schedule and on budget delivering the benefits that we forecasted. Certainly, and my comments in the script are we're going to continue to look across our portfolio as to what the current business environment looks like and we'll make judgments around any additional actions we need to take as we go through our planning cycle this summer and as we link that planning cycle with the business environment we see going forward. From the standpoint of the backlog impact for next year, and then I'll let Scott add some commentary here as well, I think we've talked a number of times around the fact that while the general economic environment in a lot of the markets that we operate and particularly impacting, say, our Merchant and Electronics businesses, the bidding activity in sort of the energy and the environmental areas, whether it be larger separation fracs for gasification, hydrogen LNG continues to remain strong, and the majority of those projects are currently in execution and meeting what we would have anticipated to be schedules associated with large, complex projects like that.","M. Scott Crocco","And just to build, this is Scott. I just want to reinforce that over 80% of our projects and backlog are tied to long-term take-or-pay contracts, and so we're not exposed to the general economic uncertainties that we are when we put in merchant capacity.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Then just a very quick clarification on the helium. The BLM is talking about shifting to market-based pricing supplies. Would that be neutral for you or negative?","Simon R. Moore","Laurence, this is Simon. It's a good question. There's obviously a lot of dynamics going on in the helium supply. There's different bills in front of different sections of the government to extend the helium program. What we believe is the BLM will want to continue to provide helium that will help enable industry as best as it can, and we're going to be a key player in that helium business going forward. At this point, it's unclear exactly how that's going to shake out but we think helium will continue to be a good part of Air Products going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. Just looking to understand how much the firmness in the general outlook for natural gas prices over the quarter would have been a tailwind in the guidance prior to the back half macro headwind?","M. Scott Crocco","This is Scott. There really hasn't been any change in our outlook for natural gas in terms of our results or guidance.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in the past, you've a bit more aggressive with the purchases around the current share price levels. Is the lower outlook going to change the strategy? Or should we expect a similar case?","M. Scott Crocco","There's no change to our strategy and our cash priorities, just to reemphasize. We're going to focus primarily and foremost on core projects with good returns, focus on raising the dividend and striving to maintain an A rating, and then buy back shares. I will remind folks, too, that we did do a share repurchase last quarter of about $460 million. And if I look back over the last 7 years or so, we did about $3 billion of share repurchases. That said, at this point in time, we're always looking at it, I wouldn't see anything on the order of what we did in the first quarter going forward in terms of share repurchase.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I think you reduced your guidance for the year by $0.27. And if you look at the midpoints -- and so that's about $57 million after tax, $76 million pretax and so your margins are roughly 15%. So what that would imply is something like a $500 million reduction to your self expectations, which seems like an awful lot. So is that really what you're trying to do with your guidance? And of the $76 million in pretax income that should disappear versus your previous expectation, where should it disappear from by segment?","M. Scott Crocco","So the 2 areas -- Jeff, this is Scott. The 2 areas that we've seen the biggest decline is in electronics. As we talked about previously, we had expectations of MSI growth being in the 4% to 6% range, now flat to down year-on-year. And then additionally, as we also mentioned in Europe, while things haven't been robust there all year, we expected a turn for the second half of the year as -- and instead we've continued to see a decline here in the second quarter, and so with particular weakness now emerging in Central and Northern Europe. So the 2 areas that we're going to see the biggest decline are in the electronics area for the materials and the Europe merchant business.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's clear enough. It's funny when you look at TSMC volumes or UMC volumes, they looked reasonably good on a monthly basis but it really doesn't come across in your electronics results. Can you just describe a little bit more precisely why -- it looks like there are winners and losers in the electronics area and how that might affect your overall volumes?","John E. McGlade","Great question, Jeff. And I think it's a reminder that the electronics market is certainly dynamic, and while we can talk in general about what's happening to the overall industry, and again as Scott has said, it looks clear that the forecast for industry growth this year are much below expectations, were at the beginning of the year. You're absolutely right. In addition, within there, certain companies have strengths and weaknesses. The foundries continue to benefit from the idea that folks want to outsource production of chips. At the same time, you see some other companies perhaps that are more tied into PCs that are showing a little bit less growth. But I think again, as we have said before, we touch all the key players in this segments. We're the leading supplier to Samsung, Intel and TSMC, which we believe over the long term will continue to be the right companies to be with. They're making the capital investments to drive growth going forward. And so really the industry, again, flat to down for the year, and that's one of the big reasons why our expectations are below what they were.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you -- maybe we could triangulate some of the comments in terms of the -- staying within that A rating and considering other strategic actions, which sounds like might include further divestitures and then your comments on not being as aggressive mostly likely with share repurchases relative to what we saw last quarter and then just sort of the negative free cash flow year-to-date. I mean, if the economic environment sort of continues as it is and earnings are going to be flat, I think, for about the third year in a row, where does all this settle out from balance sheet perspective and how aggressive do you think you can be?","John E. McGlade","So, first, let's try to take this from the top and go down. We've taken a lot of actions over the last number of years, both from a portfolio point of view and from a restructuring point of view, which I quite frankly feel we've got the right portfolio for success going forward. Certainly, the economic environment hasn't helped us, and we made the comment that we have a fairly large amount of leverage on our existing assets in merchant and electronics that we believe will provide benefits as we see slowly recovering economic growth as we look out beyond '13, our fiscal year '13. And so from that perspective, I'm pretty comfortable that we're in the right place. What I was commenting on is we'll look and we'll calibrate what that economic environment is as we go through our planning process for '14 and make adjustments to -- more to our cost base than to, let's say, our portfolio of businesses, which I did comment on I was comfortable with. The other point I'd like to make is right now as where the opportunities are in the gasification and then the hydrogen area, and that's an area as I mentioned earlier where we do see growth, and that will be good, solid growth under our tonnage business model for the future and so we're going to continue to pursue those opportunities.","M. Scott Crocco","So, this is Scott. So just to build on those comments. As we've said in the past, our focus is on executing the projects that are in the backlog, again, over 80% of which have take-or-pay terms. And while we have a terrific opportunity to load the existing assets in our Merchant business and our Electronics business, given the economic environment, we're not waiting for the economy to come back in order to load them, rather we're taking the actions in the areas that we can control to improve the margins as quickly as possible and improve our cash flow going forward.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And can I just ask a quick follow-up on -- I don't think you've covered this in the prepared remarks. The inventory revaluation in Electronics and Performance Materials, can you just go through what that was?","M. Scott Crocco","So, yes, just to refresh folks, back in the end of last year, we -- typically during the course of the year, we have inventory held at standard, when we get to the end of the year and we moved it to actual. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we moved it back to standard. Typically, when you make that move between year end and the new year, there's not that big of a movement in terms of the inventory carrying value. However, we've taken actions to reduce our cost, both from a supplier perspective, as well as bringing in some manufacturing capability in-house. And so while there was an inventory adjustment down in the first quarter, we're going to get that back over the course of the year as we see higher margins. And so that was, just to remind you about a $10 million impact that we saw in the first quarter, which did not repeat here in the second quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions on oxygen for gasification of coal in China. If I think about the, I guess, the 7 large projects that you've won there, would you comment on how the aggregate returns would compare to the company average return on capital employed of 10.9% on Slide 3? Is it lower or similar or higher? How should we think about that as those begin to flow through?","John E. McGlade","Kevin, yes, this is John, and then I can let Scott add color to this as well. Bottom line, you know that well that we do risk-adjusted returns that look at the project risk, the country risk, the cost of debt, inflation, et cetera. And when you add all of those together, China is going to have an absolute higher hurdle rate, if you will, than the corporate average and such that, while I'm not going to disclose the average returns, we feel good about the overall returns of these projects when they achieve their potential to be accretive to the returns of the company. Recognize that a project like this when you make an investment day 1 takes time for it to grow into its return on capital because, if you will, because you're putting all the capital out 3 years before you begin to produce any cash flow from the project.","M. Scott Crocco","That's right. So just to build on that. So there's the whip spending before it starts contributing back to earnings. And then just to remind folks, when you bring it on, it would be completely undepreciated. And so as you go through time, depreciation comes down, as depreciation comes down, you'll see an improvement in the ROC.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. So if I look at it on an IRR basis, it sounds like the returns will be higher due to the error [ph] for country risk. Is that fair?","John E. McGlade","That's a fair statement.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, do you think the pace of coal gasification-related oxygen activity in China will be similar the next couple of years or any faster or slower than what we've seen for the last 2 years?","John E. McGlade","So I think what you've seen in, say, to the latter part of this past year is a slowdown in, frankly, in approval of some of the projects, as China was going through its governmental changes at different levels of leadership, and so they slowed things down. Our view is that the pace of this market will continue at or above sort of if you look over the last several years the trend line rate that you saw there. It's an absolute key to both their goals around energy independence and frankly, environmental benefits by really driving these projects to really typically 1 of 3 output products. So right to diesel fuel, so a clean diesel fuel or to a synthetic natural gas, again, a more cleaner burning fuel that will be put in pipelines and pushed to the Eastern Seaboard or directly into olefins as a chemical feedstock, our building block. And our assessment of the market is that there's multiple opportunities of the scale and quantity of projects that you've seen if you looked over a trend line of the last several years.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then final question, John, if I may. You've taken action in European health care and PUI. Are there any businesses remaining in your portfolio that you would consider noncore?","John E. McGlade","So I made a comment earlier, and I'll go back to that. I actually like where the portfolio is today. I'd like to see more improvement in terms of the underlying profitability of the businesses, and I believe that will be there as we see some economic recovery in them because we have gotten a lot of the cost structure right, and we've taken a lot of actions on productivity. But the composition of the portfolio, and what I believe either their current or future contributions, the value to be are solid.","Operator","And we'll go next to P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a question on Indura. The hardgoods business at Indura was a big piece of the portfolio. How is that business holding up? And I know that Indura was not big in Brazil, but Brazil sort of drives the Latin American growth. And with slowdown in Brazil and the rest of Latin America, what's the risk to Indura's portfolio?","John E. McGlade","So P.J., obviously, South America or Latin America in general has slowed down some. It's still growing more robustly than most of the other geographies that we're operating in. Indura is meeting our expectations across a the broad business. The area that's probably weaker as we sit here today in Chile in particular is the mining segment, and that's obviously a piece of what Indura supplies in, more on the equipment side of things than the gases side of things. The good news on Indura is, first, it is holding up in terms of what REAR expectations were on costs and our being able to deliver the synergies, and then second what we bring to the table with Indura is a broader portfolio of offerings that's allowing us to enter into new market segments, if you will, from a merchant point of view and into the small on-site and Tonnage businesses that Indura hadn't been focused on historically. From a Brazil point of view, you're correct. Indura really doesn't operate in Brazil. I think you know that we have a business in Brazil that Air Products has had for many years and obviously, that business has followed the way the Brazilian economy has performed. And frankly, there, what we're doing is we've taken a lot of actions around improving our productivity, driving down our variable cost of production there, and we'll continue to look at what the opportunities are to leverage the significant investment that we now have in a fairly strong #2 position in South America and frankly, in some countries the #1 position. So how do we get the benefits, if you will, of the Indura position within the geographies they play in with some of the offerings that they have that might make sense in Brazil.","M. Scott Crocco","And just to build on John's comments, we are very pleased with how the integration is going. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we gave you guidance that year-on-year, we would expect to see a $0.10 increase in our earnings per share based off of Indura and a smooth integration in delivering the synergies, and we're on track to deliver that.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Your overall CapEx spending is still about 2x D&A. And with the slowdown in growth around the world, maybe outside of the U.S., are you seeing any delays in projects given this -- given sort of lower stimulus spending you talked about in China?","John E. McGlade","Yes, I think so. I think we really have to think about it in 2 buckets, P.J. Certainly, from the standpoint of -- and I don't know that we're not unique relative to our competitors. Certainly from the standpoint of investment in merchant capacity, yes, there's a slowdown in the investment in merchant capacity. And also obviously, in -- as you've seen in some of the electronic sectors, where people have announced not sort of a cancellation of fabs, but perhaps a several quarter delay until either they see a stronger market coming back. More importantly, though, I think, if I go back to the large oxygen for gasification in the hydrogen area, they're being driven by different macro dynamics than the underlying economy. They're being driven either by, in China, a combination of energy independence and environmental regulations around how they get to cleaner fuels or how they get to substitute fuels, and then sort of China plus the global environment, cleaner -- the demand for cleaner transportation fuel is continuing to drive hydrogen. And as Scott mentioned, 80% of our backlog is in those 2 product lines fundamentally to support the tonnage business segment and have tonnage type of terms and conditions.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just I want to clarify something that Scott said. Scott, did you say that you saw weakness in Southern Europe now spreading to Central and Northern Europe?","M. Scott Crocco","Yes, we've seen in both Central and Northern Europe. While there's always been a decline -- we saw an acceleration of decline in those 2 regions here in the second quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question -- I apologize you'll have to follow some math here. But in 2008, you guys did roughly $5 of EPS. This year on your guidance, you'll do mid-point $5.50 or so. So roughly a $0.50 increase. But if you look from 2008 to 2012, you spent about $8.5 billion in capital or about $39 a share. And the way I break that down $15 was for maintenance, $24 a share was for growth. So if you just use simple math and say, okay, we want a 10% pretax return on that capital at $24 a share, that should be about $2.40 a share, tax effective, that's about $1.80. So the capital should have grown earnings by about $1.80 a share where we've only grown $0.50. So can you help me triangulate that missing $1.20 or $1.30? How much of it is my assumptions on returns are wrong? How much of it is maybe the base business that was there in 2008 and significantly smaller now? But it just feels like we're not getting the bang for the buck when we're spending the capital that we should.","M. Scott Crocco","So 2 big elements, Duffy, and I appreciate you providing the math. I have to look at it after the call. But the 2 fundamental issues here are, as you mentioned, the investment that we've made in the base business around the merchant terms and conditions, not loading that capacity. We did not see the downturn coming that has come upon us. And so as we mentioned before, we're taking actions to control our costs for when the economy comes back. The other element, of course, is from as we talked about from the backlog, fact that we've got $3 billion in that backlog and it is currently not contributing to sales or earnings, that's why we need to focus on executing those projects and then bringing them on stream.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair enough. And then I guess, the follow-on question would be even though they're on-site, if we don't start to see the earnings increases from capital, how long is the rope before we actually start to significantly ratchet it back to capital spending?","John E. McGlade","Well, as I said earlier, if they are on an on-site basis, we do expect that recognize. We kicked up our capital from a '10 level and '11 level to a much more significant level in '12 and in '13, and these projects have about a 3-year whip frankly from the time that you put them in the capital stack or the backlog until they are brought on stream. We're constantly asking ourselves the questions around our priorities for cash and looking at whether or not these continue to be consistent with their attractive projects that support the long-term growth. I think we've demonstrated throughout the last 5 or 6 years, as Scott mentioned earlier, we make those judgments -- real time's a poor choice of words, but we make those judgments as conditions change and move between investing in the business buying $3 billion of shares back and increasing the dividend each of the last 31 years. And from my perspective, the growth opportunities provided they fit their strategy and they meet our return criteria are ultimately going to contribute the value that our shareholders are expecting from us.","Operator","We'll go next to Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","John, a question on U.S. merchant. Your loadings continue to languish here in the low 70s. I know that post the end of the Air gas bid, you put in place a major initiative in mini-bulk and expanded your sales force, and I know you talked about increasing signing. So I'm just wondering, where the payoff from this effort is. Or -- and I guess, as a follow-up to that, do you need to rationalize some of your U.S. merchant system? And just wondering if you feel you're disadvantaged by not having a cylinder gas outlet for some of that liquid?","John E. McGlade","So let me start from the back and go forward. Obviously, the calculus of getting back into a Package Gas business was the whole thought process around an integrated gas model. Therefore, more touches to the market through the sales teams, as well as more touches to a broader set of vertical sectors or market sectors. And that's old history. But if I go more to what we have done, I do feel good about the fact that we've added sales forces. We've added commercial technology resources. We've been extremely selective on where we would add capacity. And the new signings in the business have increased year-on-year for the last several years as we've added those resources. So we're getting a payoff there. What isn't as readily obvious is that the underlying base business, and I don't think this is unique to Air Products, has not been as strong as we would have hoped in the recent number of quarters. And so what you have is you're getting the benefit of the signings, they're coming in. The losses in the business are at typical levels, so they haven't moved up significantly at all. But the underlying economy, and when we came into this planning in the year, we thought we'd see a 2 to a 4 with a hope that we were going towards 4 in the U.S. business. And we're -- quite frankly, from an economic, there's a general macroeconomic closer to 2, 2.5 as we sit here today. So a lot of words to say, yes, I'm comfortable that the resource adds are delivering the merit that they were justified on. I'm not comfortable with the broader underlying business performance in certain sectors. So think of oilfield services. Simon may want to add some more color on some of the sectors that are more...","Simon R. Moore","Great, great, john. And the lonely thing I was going to just add is, Don, is of course, when we show you the negative 2% volume for U.S.\/Canada, that's across the spectrum of products. And as we mentioned on the comments, that's really driven by the helium supply challenges. In fact, if you take a look at our LOX\/LIN business in U.S.\/Canada, it's up modestly versus prior year. It's also up sequentially. So as John said, we're starting to see the benefit of some of these new contract signings the team is bringing in.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And John, a portfolio follow-up. You haven't talked much about Performance Materials, but that's not really a core gases business. I know it's been attractive financially in the past, but won't you think there's a higher value owner of that business out there and that you could use to fund to pay down debt or do something else for shareholders?","John E. McGlade","Well, so, Don, as I mentioned earlier in the call, I feel comfortable about the portfolio we have today. That statement is inclusive of Performance Materials. Frankly, it adds value to the shareholders, and I really believe that we're delivering and are operating as a high-value owner of that business today.","Operator","We'll go next to David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, Air Products, I was curious, if you could talk about industrial gas is growing at a multiple GDP, maybe 1.3x, 1.5x. Has that multiplied or IP -- has that multiplier compressed over the past few years?","John E. McGlade","I think, so that would be -- that's sort of an all-in average, if you will. That's going to really be a function of the maturity level of the economies that you're growing in. And so if you were to look at areas like Latin America and you were to look at Asia sort of during a trend line time versus some of the blips we have seen in the economic cycle, I think that multiple still holds pretty well. Certainly, in the more mature economies of the world, it's at the low end of that. And then if you go into a scenario where you're in Europe, where you have an economic decline, obviously, there's very limited growth there and therefore you're not going to get that. And so that's what -- you got to aggregate the different economies of the world to come to that.","M. Scott Crocco","As well as the drivers. So as John mentioned before, well, that's high-level statistic over a long period of time. There are fundamental drivers that aren't directly correlated with GDP or manufacturing output. For example, coal oxygen for coal gasification, driving energy independence in China; hydrogen for cleaner fuels. Those sorts of drivers or things that are not directly cause and effect to manufacturing output or GDP.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And Scott, just on the backlog, what was the actual backlog at quarter end? And given the number of projects coming on stream, shouldn't that be lower by year end?","M. Scott Crocco","So $3 billion is where we were at the end of this quarter, and it's lumpy. So as projects come in and come out, it might be -- I don't see a substantial change by year end, maybe down a little bit as we process through some of the projects in there. But also of course depends on the wins, and we feel good about some opportunities to what we're pursuing as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","You mentioned some LOX\/LIN pricing pressure in both Europe and Asia. I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color around what's driving that, could it worsen? And maybe just talking in general terms about LOX\/LIN supply and demand dynamics in the competitive environment that you're seeing across Asia, Europe and North America?","M. Scott Crocco","Yes, good question, Mike. And I think it's important to frame that right. So what we're not saying is that we've seen a step change or anything like that in competitive price pressure. But I think as you look at the different regions, particularly if you look at the region like Asia, there's clearly some extra capacity in the ground for the industry right now. So I think what we're just trying to help you appreciate is we are seeing a slight increase in competitive pressure. I would say you tend to see that more on new business. So it's not so much that we are seeing competitive pressure on existing business, but new business growth is eagerly looked for by most of the companies. So that's probably the case in Asia. Again in Europe, we're not signaling any step change here, but a little bit more pressure on the LOX\/LIN. As we said, we have -- the team is doing a great job on new contact signings and traditionally, those do come out at slightly lower price than the base business. In North America, we talked about we are getting positive price. You saw the price increase announcement that we put out last week. We believe that, that makes sense, and we can continue to earn more price increases, recognizing that we have seen power and distribution cost increases as well.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And can you talk in a little bit more detail about some of the higher costs you're seeing that's driving you to push a little bit harder on the merchant pricing? Are those just U.S. costs? And I guess, as you look out a couple of quarters, are you still going to be playing catch-up on cost, or do you think you should be covered if you get the traction that you're looking for?","M. Scott Crocco","Well, it's a good question. And I think you appreciate that while we put that price increase out and certainty that triggers the discussion with our customers, really our pricing decisions are made on a customer-by-customer basis. So we take a good, hard look at the economics and the profitability of a customer and make a decision about what we want to do from a price standpoint. Again, I would say primarily in the U.S., which is what the price increase announcement was referring to, again, as I said it was really power and distribution costs that we'll be hoping to catch up on.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And sticking with the North American merchant market, can you talk a little bit about how volumes were trending during the quarter? It sounds like if we sort of exclude what's going on with helium and just look at LOX\/LIN, that net-net, it was flat, it was maybe slightly up during the quarter, year-on-year. Presumably January was pretty strong and February weakened, what have you been seeing over the last 2 months or so?","M. Scott Crocco","Well, it's a good question. And again, as we said, overall for the quarter we were up slightly. I don't think we saw anything significantly different as he went through the 3 months of the quarter. So it was fairly consistent relative to last year.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And last question is just on the Tonnage business in the hydrogen spot sales that were pretty strong last quarter. You didn't expect those to be sustainable into this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what spot activity look like, and in particular how the Gulf Coast pipeline was operating during Q2?","John E. McGlade","So I think, from a strategic point of view, that investment has demonstrated its worth in the first couple of quarters, that it's been operating, whether it be from the standpoint of the spot volumes, the efficiencies and the productivity or cost gains that we can get. The biggest issue probably in Q2 was a number of significant turnarounds of our customers facilities combined with a couple of unexpected outages at 2 important customers that gave, frankly, the whole opportunity to sell more hydrogen less of an opportunity. I didn't quite phrase that right, but you had less of an opportunity because you had some of the biggest sources or users, some of the biggest customers down either because of scheduled turnarounds or unscheduled turnarounds. But if I were to step back and say from a strategic point of view, has that created competitive -- a differentiated competitive position for us? Absolutely. And does it give us the opportunity to continue to drive productivity efficiency and spot sales? Also absolutely.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Sison from KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of your outlook for Tonnage new projects coming in this year, I think, it was $0.25 to $0.30. Is that the same, and just curious of, how much of that came in the first half? And I would imagine the remaining is pretty visible to you.","M. Scott Crocco","Yes, Mike, this is Scott. So we do see it still in that range probably with some of the projects that have been deferred by a quarter or so, maybe trending towards the low end of that range, but still in that range. And I would say while we've seen some of it that's going to be more towards the back half of the year as opposed to the first half.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then your outlook for Merchant for the second half of the year, you sort of noted that would be better in the third versus second or sequential basis. But will you be able to generate some volume growth? Is that the assumption for the second half? Or is it still going to be kind of tough to do that in this environment?","M. Scott Crocco","Well, it is. So we are assuming that -- recall that in the first half of the year, there's more holidays. You've got Christmas in Q1. You've got Lunar New Year in the second quarter. So as we move into the second half of the year, in general, we have a stronger Q3 and Q4, let's call it seasonality. And then on top of it, we're also anticipating a sequentially improving economic environment, both of which will drive volume increases, as well as the impacts from our new signings coming on stream.","John E. McGlade","Yes, this is John. Just following up with a very quick wrap-up. I wanted to just make the points again, that we do have a strong backlog of projects with numerous opportunities for growth in those projects. We have significant leverage on our existing assets that leave us well positioned for a recovery, and we remain sharply focused on productivity, improving our core businesses and delivering on our cash priorities. You'll have the opportunity to go to our website for a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. And I'd like to just thank you on behalf of the management team for joining us in having a great day. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' third quarter 2015 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in our company. First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products' Executive Vice President in charge of Material Technologies. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions.","I am very pleased to report that Air Products team delivered great results in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2015. Therefore, before I go any further, I want to thank all of the talented, dedicated and committed employees of Air Products for doing such a great job. What we are presenting you today is the result of our 20,000 employees coming to work every day, committed to serving our customers and improving every aspect of our performance. Our people are the force behind our progress. I certainly consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team.","Now, please turn to slide number 3. We always start our internal and external presentations with a discussion of our safety performance. Year-to-date, we improved our lost time injury rate by 21% and recordable injury rate by 17%. As we have said before, excellence in safety requires focus, discipline, process orientation and execution. These same characteristics are required for excellence in business performance, too. The improvement in our safety results, which is our number one priority, is encouraging, but our ultimate goal is zero accidents and zero incidents.","Now, please turn to slide number 4. I would like to continue to remind everybody that our goal has always been, and will continue to be, to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. This is not an aspirational goal. It is not a goal that we just dream about. It is real and it is the target of the day-to-day activities of all of our 20,000 people who are determined to get us there.","Last year, we were number three. Now, we are number two, and we are focused to becoming number one. Now, please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy. Some of you have seen this slide before, but it is important to emphasize that we believe cash is king, and the true measures of our performance is the price of our stock in the long-term.","We are very focused on proper allocation of capital. Air Products generates a significant amount of cash. We, the management of the company, fully understand that the proper and sensible allocation of that cash is a clear element of value creation for our shareholders. And as you have seen from our actions in the last year, we have moved toward a decent role organization, which has had the benefit of creating accountability and reducing our costs.","Now, please turn to slide number 6, our five-point strategic plan that we announced in September of 2014. We are diligently and consistently executing this plan. And you can certainly see the impact on our results, which clearly show the improvement in profit margins. When we announced our strategy, we said that the proper execution of this plan will lead to an improvement in our margins of 600 basis points or about $600 million. Half of that or about $300 million was to come from reducing our overhead costs enabled by the significant reorganization of the company. We are making great progress and expect to deliver about $150 million of these benefits into our P&L this year.","We expect to be at the full annual rate of $300 million of saving by quarter two of fiscal year 2016. So, you will see almost the full $300 million impact in our 2016 results. The other half or another $300 million will be savings in distribution, operations, electrical usage and other field operational costs. Currently, we expect to get all of these savings in the next four years.","Now, please turn to slide number 7. Scott will take you through the details, but I want to highlight a few key points. Our EBITDA profit margin is up 430 basis points versus last year. We are now generating free cash flow, and our earning per share is up 13% versus last year despite the weak economy across the globe and $0.11 negative impact from currency translation.","In addition, our return on capital employed now stands at 10.9%, which is an improvement of 130 basis points versus last year. As Scott will explain, we improved our margins in all of our businesses and specifically showed significant improvement in our core Industrial Gases business. I am encouraged by the results and the progress we have made in the last years.","Now, please turn to slide number 8, where you will see our steady progress in improving our EBITDA margin. We do appreciate that we have more work to do to become the most profitable industrial gas company in the world. But as you can see, we are on our way. Air Products is moving forward with the full force and support of all of our 20,000 people. I am very proud of the team and very optimistic about our future.","Before I turn it over to Scott, I would like to comment on the appointment of Mr. Casey Cogut, who will be joining the board of Air Products. Mr. Cogut is one of the most prominent and well-known corporate lawyers in America. He has extensive experience, has been involved in some of the largest mergers and acquisition transactions in the last 30 years, and has been a sought-after adviser to the board of many companies. I am very pleased to welcome him to the Air Products board. He brings with him, a wealth of knowledge and experience that we currently do not have on our board. We have issued a separate press release about his appointment and his background.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details. Then, I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo, and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you very much, Seifi. Now, please turn to slide 9 for a more detailed review of our Q3 results. Sales of $2.5 billion decreased 6% as strong underlying growth of 4% was more than offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 6% and a lower energy pass-through impact of 4%. Volumes increased 3%. In Gases-Asia, volume growth was driven primarily by new plants in China. Materials Technologies, again, saw solid growth driven by our Electronics Materials businesses, and our LNG business posted another strong quarter.","Pricing was 1% higher, driven by price increases in Gases-Americas and Gases-Europe, and both favorable price and mix in Materials Technologies. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA improved 9% and operating income improved 17% despite the lower sales. Versus prior year, EBITDA margin improved 430 basis points to 30.7%, while our operating margin improved 380 basis points to 19.5%.","We saw improvement across all our regional Industrial Gases segments and in Materials Technologies. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 50 basis points. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 330 basis points was well balanced, resulting from higher volumes, higher prices and lower costs.","Higher volumes and better cost performance contributed to our sequential margin improvement. This quarter is a new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. Versus prior year, net income increased 14%, earnings per share grew by 13%, and we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased by 130 basis points to 10.9%.","Now, please turn to slide number 10. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased again this quarter, and free cash flow was up $87 million as we generated higher EBITDA and spent less on both growth capital and maintenance capital.","We are focused on optimizing maintenance capital, spending the right amount at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in cash, taxes and dividends. From a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.","Turning to slide 11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q3 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that total $0.18 per share or $60 million pre-tax, all related to our restructuring actions. This includes $24 million for position eliminations and pension settlements, and $36 million for asset actions primarily related to product line exits as we continue to focus on our core business. We expect to see restructuring cost and pension settlement cost in fiscal Q4 as we continue to simplify the organization and reduce cost.","Excluding these items, our Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.65 increased $0.19 or 13% versus last year, despite the significant currency headwinds. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.13 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.11. Net cost performance was $0.11 favorable as the benefits from our cost reduction actions more than overcame a $0.10 headwind from higher incentive compensation.","As a result of our improved performance expectations for the full year, we increased our incentive compensation accrual in the quarter. In total, our cost reduction actions delivered $0.18 per share of benefit. These benefits consist of lower personnel costs, as well as actions enabled by our new, more disciplined organization. These actions include reducing contractors, consultants, travel and other discretionary spending.","Unfavorable currency translation of $0.11 \u2013 I'm sorry, unfavorable currency translation was $0.11 as almost currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, our currency exposure is primarily translational as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Interest expense was $0.01 lower. Taxes and non-controlling interest were both $0.02 unfavorable. Our tax rate of about 25% increased 1%. For the full year, we still expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%. Non-controlling interest was higher this year due to the increased value of the minority position in Indura. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02.","Before I turn the call over to Corning, I'd like to discuss the transaction we just completed last week. We purchased all the outstanding shares of our largest minority partner in Indura, which is one of our industrial gas businesses in Latin America. Following this transaction, we now own about 98% of Indura.","The valuation was agreed to at the time of the initial purchase in 2012 and will be a use of cash of $278 million in Q4. Because we previously owned a majority of Indura and we're already consolidating results, there will be no impact to reported sales, EBITDA or operating income. But as we now own a larger portion, there will be a smaller reduction from non-controlling interest that should improve earnings per share by about $0.02 to $0.03 per year beginning in Q4. We have used commercial paper to fund this purchase.","Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Thanks, Scott. The Industrial Gas team continues to improve our business by executing our five-point plan. For the three regional Industrial Gas segments in total, EBITDA margins were up over 500 basis points versus last year. And each of these three segments reported the highest margins in the 11 quarters that we have provided restated financials for.","The strong performance was delivered in an uncertain economic environment with modest manufacturing growth and profit headwinds from currency, lower energy prices and higher incentive compensation. On a constant currency basis, operating income for the three segments combined was up 17%.","We delivered these results by focusing on what we control. First, reducing overhead costs by restructuring to our new regional organization. Next, under that organization, uncovering issues, embracing the red as we say, and tackling them to unlock operational productivity with a no excuses attitude. This has been an eventful year at Air Products. And I would like to thank the team for grabbing the opportunity we have been given and running with it. The results speak for themselves.","With that, please turn to slide 12 for a review of our Gases-Americas results. We again delivered strong results this quarter as significant cost improvements translated into very strong margin growth. Sales of $898 million were down 16% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 13%. The price of natural gas in the Houston Ship Channel was down over 40%. As a reminder, lower natural gas prices have a significant negative effect on reported revenues, a modest negative impact on profits, and a positive impact on margins.","Currency, primarily the Chilean peso, Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar, reduced our sales by 3%. However, underlying sales were flat as higher pricing of 1% offset 1% lower volumes. North America liquid oxygen and nitrogen volumes were up mid-single digit, and we did not see any drop-off through the quarter. HyCO volumes were down slightly, but within typical customer demand fluctuation as our refinery customers continue to operate at high levels. Helium demand remained off. On-site oxygen demand from the steel market was lower. And we will have a few quarters of reduced wholesale oxygen sales until that is replaced by retail signing.","We also saw lower Latin American demand, particularly in Brazil. Pricing was up 1% versus last year despite reductions in some of the formula-based contracts for liquid products.","Operating income of $207 million was up 9%, and EBITDA of $328 million was up 6% as lower costs and positive pricing more than offset profit headwinds from currency, higher incentive compensation and lower energy pass-through. The lower costs were primarily driven by our restructuring actions, lower planned maintenance outages versus last year, and other productivity actions.","Operating margin of 23% was up 520 basis points, with about 200 basis points from lower costs, 100 basis points from pricing and 200 from lower energy pass-through. EBITDA margin of 36.5% was up 740 basis points. Sequentially, profits were also up as volume, price and costs were all positive. And finally, as Scott mentioned, we are excited about the significant increase in our ownership of Indura to Latin American Industrial Gases business. And we're looking forward to more fully implementing our five-point plan and driving further business improvement.","Now, please turn to slide 13. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa regional business, we saw the benefit of the cost restructuring actions as both EBITDA and operating margins were up over 300 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $455 million were reduced by 16% due to currency, primarily the euro, the British pound and the Polish zloty.","Underlying sales were up 2%, with volumes up 1% and pricing up 1%. We saw positive merchant volumes in the UK-Ireland, mixed in Southern Europe, and weakness in Northern and Central Europe. We have seen some negative volume impact in our Rotterdam hydrogen pipeline in part due to transportation fuel imports from the U.S. negatively impacting European refinery operation.","We're pleased that our team improved pricing by 1% in this weak economic environment with increases across both packaged gases and liquid\/bulk. Sequentially, volumes were up 2%, driven primarily by better LOX\/LIN volumes. Versus last year, reported operating income was up slightly as the positive impact from our restructuring actions overcame the significant currency headwind. On a constant currency basis, operating income was up almost 20%. Versus last quarter, EBITDA was up 16% and operating income was up 23% primarily on significantly improved costs, driven by the benefit from the cost reduction and productivity actions.","Please turn to slide 14. Gases-Asia delivered another strong quarter, with new plants driving both volume and profit growth. In addition, cost reduction actions helped to increase EBITDA by 12% and operating income by 20%. Sales were up 14% to $418 million, driven by volumes, up 11% primarily from the new plant. There has been some recent excitement in the Chinese markets. I would like to remind you that the majority of our business in China is protected by secure take-or-pay terms. And with the large plants coming on stream, this proportion of our business is only growing.","For our most recent project, for Zhengyuan in Hebei, which came on in \u2013 stream in early Q3. In addition to having take-or-pay terms, we also have secure energy pass-through terms in our contracts because the customer supplies the energy, in most cases, for these large plants. Occasionally, we see swings in the energy pass-through around customer startups. This has no impact on profit, but it can impact sales.","Most importantly, as I have said before, customers are executing their projects, operating their gasifiers, taking oxygen, and we are getting paid. Overall merchant volumes were up low to mid single digits across Asia. Our China retail LOX\/LIN business was up mid single-digits, while overall China LOX\/LIN was down as we focus on increasing our retail business while reducing wholesale volumes.","We still see end market demand growth in China, but certainly, at a slower rate and with more uncertainty than a few years ago. Sequentially, volumes were up 5% with merchant volumes up significantly following the Lunar New Year holiday. Pricing was down 2% as overcapacity in China continues to pressure liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon pricing. Air Products has no new China liquid capacity to bring on-stream, however, others do.","Operating income of $101 million was up 20%, operating margin was up 130 basis points, and EBITDA was up 12% with new plant on-streams, restructuring and productivity programs more than overcoming higher incentive compensation and pricing. Sequential profits were up, primarily due to the acceleration of the cost savings from our restructuring actions and improved merchant volumes.","We've talked a lot about driving improvement in the existing business and executing our projects in our backlog. We're also very excited to have won a major contract to supply bulk gases to a new Giga Fab Campus in South Korea. This is an example of the Industrial Gases team continuing Air Products' leadership in the semiconductor industry.","I will close with a few words on the global gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Unit sale of equipment business, as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gases business which are not region-specific. Our overall sales were flat with last year, although the business mix was different, with lower small equipment sales to the oil and gas market and higher ASU sale. This business mix difference was a profit headwind. Also, last quarter, we had more favorable contract actions than this quarter. We did see lower cost from the restructuring actions that we are taking","Now, I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President Materials Technologies","Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 15. The Materials Technologies team continues to deliver very strong results, with volume growth and cost focus raising margins by over 500 basis points to the highest levels in the 11 quarters we have provided financials. In fact, our operating margins are up 900 basis points over the last 2 years. Our team is working hard to become more independent within our products, and our people continue to be excited about the potential of our strong portfolio of businesses and leading market positions. They are delivering both safety and business results.","Segment sales of $540 million were up 3% versus prior year. Underlying sales were up 7% on 4% volume growth and 3% positive price mix, with a partial offset from currency. Electronic sales were up 18% on a constant currency basis, driven by positive volume, price and mix. Processed materials volumes were up on continued high memory demand. As a result of a tighter supply\/demand dynamics, we're seeing improved pricing and have signed a number of multi-year supply agreements with our customers that will improve volume and earning stability in the future.","Advanced Materials continues to benefit from our materials being used in our customers' newest and most advanced production lines. Delivery systems was about flat versus last year, but we have begun to see the expected slowdown on a sequential basis. Within Delivery Systems, our equipment sales are holding up, but we will see a decline from less installation work as specific customers have completed their fab projects.","Although overall Electronics Materials demand remained strong given recent industry communications, we continue to monitor the potential impact of changing macroeconomic drivers on 2016. For our business, it is critical to look at both macro drivers, as well as customer-specific dynamics.","We're often asked about the impact of lower PC demand on our business. Over the long term, we see slower PC demand more than offset with higher demand for mobile devices and the significant computing power in many non-computing devices. There are some indications of more moderate growth for 2016, driven by weaker PC demand and softening consumer demand in the mobile space. In the memory market, there has been some reduction in DRAM pricing given higher supply, but volumes have been holding up as customers bring on new capacity. The NAND market remains strong.","Performance Materials sales were down 2% on a constant currency basis on lower volumes across our epoxy and additives businesses, driven by softness in construction, coatings, I&I and oil field. We did see sequential volume improvement, but less than the typical seasonal improvement.","As Q3 end market demand was softer than expected, especially North America and China, we remained cautious about the outlook for seasonal improvements through 2015. Versus last year, price is flat, but margins have improved given lower raw material cost and cost reduction actions. The lower raw material costs are having some negative impact in terms of inventory revaluation.","Given our business profile and supply footprint, currency continues to be a major headwind for this business. Over the last three quarters, we've been able to capture significant volume growth, and several of our businesses are now running their plants at very high utilization rates. Last year, we initiated several investments to expand capacity in both the U.S. and in Asia. These investments will support volume growth for our existing products, as well as growth of the new product in our portfolio.","We're excited about a new Performance Materials production facility that is currently under construction in Pasadena, Texas. This investment of over $100 million will support the growth of our Performance Materials portfolio over the coming years. We are also relocating one of our Performance Materials plants in China to our main manufacturing site in Nanjing, where \u2013 which will provide an increasing capacity and operating synergies. We've also made several smaller investments to support growth of a number of new product introductions in our Electronics portfolio. As we look into 2016, we are considering several smaller investments to debottleneck plants, add capacity, and support new product growth of our Electronics Materials portfolio.","As I shared with you at the Investor Conference, our capital intensity is much lower than gases, and we generate a high level of free cash flow. Our maintenance CapEx is only about 1.5% of sales. However, we do periodically need to make investments to support new product opportunities and the growth of our overall portfolio.","Let me make some comments about innovation as it is critical to the success of our Materials Technologies business. We continue to be very excited about our innovation portfolio. Our Electronics Materials portfolio is delivering strong growth from new products during 2015, and we continue to achieve profits of record for new nodes, which will drive future growth.","In Performance Materials, our non-emissive technologies continue to achieve strong market penetration across a number of applications. And our additives business is delivering growth from new product introductions across a number of specialty applications. We are confident in the returns we're getting from our technology investment, and we are committed to maintaining the technology leadership in the market segments that we are focused on.","EBITDA of $155 million was up 27%, and EBITDA margins of 28.6% was up 540 basis points versus last year. Operating income of $132 million was up 36% and operating margins of 24.4% was up 600 basis points. Volume leverage, positive price and mix, and the cost benefits of our restructuring actions overcame currency headwind and higher incentive compensation cost.","As I said, another quarter of great results by the team. We're executing on and remain focused on our key priorities; safety, top line growth, margin enhancement and advancing our strategic initiatives to drive further business improvement.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a quick comment on our Corporate segment.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Guillermo. Our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses, as well as corporate costs, which are not business specific. Sales were up this quarter as we continue to see higher LNG sales more than offsetting lower helium container sales. The LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact future results. The improved profitability this quarter was driven by the higher LNG activity. A positive benefit from restructuring actions was offset by higher incentive compensation.","Now, I will turn the call back over Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you again, Simon. Now, please turn to slide number 16 for a discussion of our outlook. During the year, on all of our calls, I have said that we are not going to use the weak worldwide economy nor the negative impact of currency translation as an excuse to reduce our guidance that we promised you back in October. So, I'm very pleased to announce that at this time, based on what we know, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 is $1.75 to $1.85 per share.","At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.14 or 8% over the previous year, and an increase of $0.15 or 9% over our fiscal year third quarter that we are just talking about. This takes our full year 2015 guidance up to $6.50 to $6.60 per share. At midpoint, this represents a 13% increase over our 2014 results and is $0.13 higher than the target we committed to you back in October. This is despite the fact that we don't see any significant improvement in the worldwide economy, and now expect about $0.35 negative headwind from currency translation.","As for capital expenditure in 2015, we expect about $1.7 billion, the same number that we shared with you last quarter.","We do continue to enjoy a robust backlog with a high level of secure on-site pipeline projects. Most importantly, we are bringing projects on line that are contributing volume, sales and profit. At the same time, we are bidding and winning new projects in the marketplace. As a result, our backlog of $3.2 billion remains unchanged from last quarter, and you can see a list of our major projects in the Appendix slides.","In closing, I would like to say that we are totally focused on actions that we can control to deliver on the commitments that we are making here. We are executing on our improvement program, and our plan and our team is working together to achieve our goals. Once again, I want to commend the Air Products team for outstanding job that they are doing. They are driving significant change in the company and working hard to move Air Products forward to create value for our shareholders and customers.","At this time now, we are delighted to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. And we'll move on to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hey. Good morning, P.J. How are you today?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good. Good. So, you commented that you will realize the first $300 million of cost savings by next year and the remainder over the next four years.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, yes.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","What is the cadence of this cost savings over the next four years and how do this cost savings break down geographically?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","What \u2013 first of all, the cost savings would be across the board in all of our businesses, number one. The second thing is that when I say $300 million over four years, that's obviously $75 million a year. That's kind of the variable cascade approximately.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And you said the geographic spread, is that sort of based on size of business in each region?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that \u2013 I mean, the area that we can see the biggest amount of improvement is obviously our Latin America operations, but they do have room to improve our results in all of the sectors. I would like Corning to make some more comments on this.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. Good morning. So, when we allocated out these targets across the regions, we clearly looked at the nature of the business, the nature of the spend, the assets in each area. So, it's not like a flat percentage for everyone. It's appropriate for each business opportunity.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And my second question is on Energy-from-Waste. How close are you to getting these plants running and what's your confidence level in the technology? And you talked about divesting these plants in the future. Are you in conversations with your partner there? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","As far as the construction of the first unit, we are almost done with the construction and we are in the startup. As far as the confidence in the technology, we'll find out. This is one of a kind, first time anybody has built a plant of this size, and we will find out what the technology does, whether it works or it doesn't work. We are in the middle of doing that and I don't really have any significant update for you.","As far as being in conversation with anybody, no, we are not in any conversation until we get these plants operating. Because if they are not going to operate, there is no conversation to be had.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, P.J.","Operator","Well go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Congratulations on a great quarter, guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, Duffy. Appreciate that.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to talk through \u2013 your volume seemed to be running better than industry so far. How much of those volumes were new plants coming on line and how much is just you guys doing a better job of selling product in already existing markets?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","I would like Corning to answer that, but we are not after gaining market share. We are after making sure that we serve our current customers, and most of the increase in volumes are from new plants. But I'll let Corning to comment because most of this is in our Industrial Gases business.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. So, I think if you looked at this regional slice that we have, you could see a large proportion of this is in Asia. And what you're seeing in Asia is the new plants coming on stream pretty much in total, okay? And that's really a large part of the picture here.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","And you would expect that because that is where we have made significant investments, and so we are now getting the benefit of that.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fair enough. And then just to go back to the cost cuts. So, the two buckets of $300 million, one, you said you'll be at $150 million run rate on the first run by the end of this year, the whole $300 million on a run rate by Q2 of next year, then the second $300 million, you talked about getting in four years. Does that four years include this year just completed or that four-year clock starts ticking as we get into 2016?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","It starts as of \u2013 when we get into fiscal year 2016.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","We are working on that but, I mean, that would be the approximate date.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Thanks, Duffy.","Operator","We'll go next is John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Mr. McNulty, please check your mute button. Hearing no response, we'll move on to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Seifi, just wanted to know what turned out better in the quarter than you originally expected? Because I know your original guidance range was $1.58 to $1.60. So, did some of the cost savings occur earlier than expected or was organic growth better in some markets than you thought it might be?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","There were two things. Number one, when we gave our guidance at the end of last quarter, Don, as you know, we have seen really weak month of March and April. And we were very concerned about how the economy will develop, especially in the U.S. Things have turned out better in the U.S. than we thought.","The second thing is that our plants in China came on stream sooner than we thought.","So, those were the two main reasons. The cost savings are in line with what we expected because we have a very detailed program on that. But the \u2013 it was \u2013 I mean, we were cautious because of the economy and the plants in China, and those two turned out to be better than we expected.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then on slide 10, I noticed that your maintenance and growth CapEx was down year-over-year, and Scott talked about the focus on optimizing maintenance capital. So, is the \u2013 you've talked in the past, the $250 million to $300 million run rate on maintenance capital. Is the new rates lower given your comments on how you're trying to optimize that level?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, no, no, no. Please be careful. We are not trying to optimize maintenance. We are trying to \u2013 we will maintain and we are maintaining our facilities. And the number that you are quoting, about $300 million in maintenance, is absolutely correct. The issue is that with maintenance, as you know, it's a lumpy thing depending on when customers shut down plants. So, it is going to go up and down quarter-by-quarter. But order of magnitude, $250 million to $300 million is the maintenance cost for Air Products.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks, Don.","Operator","We'll go next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. How are you?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thank you. Seifi, Material Technologies, excellent results this quarter. Has this quarter and the last quarter changed your view at all as to whether this belongs in the portfolio longer term?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","No. We have always said that we want to focus on Industrial Gases. So, that has been our strategy and it will continue to be our strategy. I'm very pleased with the job that Guillermo and his people are doing, but we still consider that business, at the end of the day, to be non-core.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And do you have a timeframe for realizing that as being non-core?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","David, don't \u2013 I mean, you know that I can't give you anything like that because we are looking at all of our options, as you know. So...","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Just looking at slide 20, your backlog, I'm counting six new plants starting up in fiscal year 2016. Do you have any update on sort of the time or the cadence of those through the years or \u2013 through the year or how we should be thinking about the earnings impact for 2016?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","I'd like Corning to comment on it, but as long \u2013 as far as I know, all of them are supposed to come on stream per plant. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. Maybe just a little recognition for the team. So, these are large plants. It's been a big effort to get them to completion and get them started up. We talked about we've had one come on in this quarter very smoothly. We expect these plants to come on next year likewise, and kind of what you see in that Appendix, that reflects our latest thinking on it.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I guess, I was just kind of looking for a little bit more detail on are some of them first half, are some of them second half, just in terms of as we look at our models.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","I think it's \u2013 when you're looking at your models, I think it would be wise to spread it evenly across the year.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the \u2013 your cash flow statement. There was a big swing for the year-to-date in payables and accrued liabilities. Is that just a function of your reduced head count expense or what's causing that?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Scott will answer that.","Michael Scott Crocco - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Vincent, for that question. So, biggest swing in working capital is being driven by the incentive compensation. So, we call that \u2013 that's an expense that is noncash at this point in time. Obviously, when we get to the first quarter of FY 2016, we'll have a payout, but that's a big driver in terms of the improvement in working capital for the quarter.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi. How are you?","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good. Thanks. So, just had a quick question. Obviously, in this quarter, you saw a nice kind of cash flow expansion at least on a year-over-year basis. And as your CapEx starts to wind down, your earnings wind up. And I'm wondering, as we look out to 2016, we should probably see some more earnings growth. And assuming the CapEx doesn't rise with it, can you give us an update on what your plans are, what your kind of priorities are for the uses of that cash?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we \u2013 that's an excellent question. I just kind of \u2013 it will take a minute to answer that completely. Our \u2013 we have always said that we think we will create the greatest amount of value for our shareholders if we take the cash that we generate and invest it in good projects, in organic growth. So, that is our number one priority. And the good news is that there a lot of those projects.","So, whatever cash we generate, I think we will have a good use for it to promote organic growth. If for some reason, because of all bad economic conditions and so on, there are no such opportunities, then the next best use of cash is for accretive, good acquisitions. Then, if there are no such thing as that, then the third thing, we think, is to return it to shareholders in form of dividend or share buyback, depending on where the share price is. So, that would be our priority as we generate cash.","But the main thing is our issue has been we've been generating cash. Now that we are generating cash, we have those options. There is one other thing that I'll mention \u2013 I would like to mention and we have said this before, we are very focused on making sure that we maintain our A rating. So \u2013 we always need to make sure that we have enough cash to maintain the A rating that we have. We don't want to lose that. Therefore, that means we are not going to go on do what I don't think makes sense, is borrow many and buy shares in order to prop up the share price. Okay?","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thanks. That's really helpful. And if you can, could you also provide \u2013 as you're looking out for the best growth projects, as you're looking to build your pipeline, is there a specific region or a specific end market that is particularly attractive to you based on what you're seeing right now?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Obviously, right now, there is significant amount of opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast because of all of the chemical projects that are under consideration. There are significant opportunities around the world for hydrogen. We are the leader in hydrogen, and as a result of that, that creates a lot of opportunities for us. So, the opportunities are worldwide, but obviously and proportionally, there are more opportunities in the U.S. And we are very well positioned in the U.S., and we think that we will get our fair share of the market.","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","First off, wondering about your decision to increase the ownership position in Indura. I think it was a year ago, you had mentioned that the purchase price assumptions were incorrect in some way. And I'm wondering, based on the predetermined price, can you talk about how you got comfortable with the valuation parameters this time around and just the strategic intent of increasing your ownership there?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm very happy that you asked the question. We did not decide to buy the shares. I wouldn't have bought the shares. The \u2013 as part of the original agreement, the sellers had a put option on Air Products. And obviously, it was a good price, though they put it to us. We had no choice. If we had the choice, we wouldn't have bought it at the price. We would have liked to \u2013 but it was a put option, so they put it to us, they have to live by the contract that was negotiated at the time the purchase price was done. So, the good news is that now, at least, we are in full control, and we can do what we need in improving that business. But it wasn't as if we sat down and decided that, gee, this is a great thing to do.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And second, your new board member is experienced, seems very deep in M&A. Is there any information content there as it relates to your pace of mergers, acquisitions, divestitures going forward or is that just, like you said, filling a gap that you might have had?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","It is just filling a gap. I think it's the second thing that you said. We just look at the board, and a board of any company is supposed to be a collection of people with different skills, and this was an area where we didn't have the skill, and I think it was \u2013 we are very fortunate that Mr. Cogut has agreed to serve on our board. He's \u2013 we all have a great deal of respect for him. He is very well-known, and I think he will be a very good addition to our board.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Roberts with UBS.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Back to the Indura deal, the original deal was $884 million for 67%, and now, you're paying $278 million for 30.5%. So, if you just scaled on the ownership, it's about a 30% lower price for the same percent of ownership. Is Indura down more than 30%? Is that your comment there about you wouldn't have bought it? It seems like a materially lower price for this similar amount of ownership.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","It's just pure luck because it's currency, because the deal was in Chilean pesos.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got it.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","And as a result, the value in terms of dollars has gone down.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then, Corning, on the volumes in China, the remaining big plants come up in phases. I assume once you're fully ramped, you'll be more subject to the macros there. How much longer before you're fully ramped in China? We have more than four quarters left of ramping to go on there or does it extend even beyond that?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well \u2013 Corning will answer that? Go ahead.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. So, I think, to some degree, the answer to your question is in that table. So, you can look at when the plants come on. As those come on, each one of them represents a step change from that. There's the potential that we would identify additional attractive investments between now and then, but I think that's sort of your roadmap.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. The ones that come up in phases, are they relatively linear? See, you've got some asterisks in that table.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. So, I think you would expect, as Seifi said earlier, that you're just going to see this spread out over the course of the next fiscal year.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on Laurence. Just one quick question on Materials Technologies. You said in Performance Materials, you're seeing some softness in construction and in oilfield. Well, oilfield is obviously known. I was just wondering where you're seeing the weakness in construction. Is there is a specific region or just a specific area? Just a little color on that.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Guillermo will answer that.","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President Materials Technologies","Yeah. A lot of our business \u2013 we're more on the industrial and protective coatings and floorings. So, it's more of the non-residential construction, and we're seeing most of that in the U.S., some softness versus our expectations, and in Asia, mostly around China.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations again on an excellent quarter, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much. You're very kind. Thanks.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. On the backlog, $3.2 billion, a pretty solid figure here. I'm just wondering if you could give your outlook for the second half of the calendar year. Would you expect that to move up or down? And how would you characterize the bidding activity there? Is it getting more competitive in your view?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","I don't want to comment on the competitiveness because that's not appropriate. But in terms of the backlog changing, I think some projects will come on stream, they go off backlog, and hopefully, we'll win some projects and we will add it. So, I would not see a material change.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then on the Americas, your pricing was up. I'm just wondering if you could break that out a little bit between Latin America and the U.S. Was pricing up more in Brazil or could you comment specifically on how your pricing is in the U.S.?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Right. Excellent question. So, you can imagine in the high-inflation regions, it is much easier to drive pricing, and really essential to drive pricing. So, in places like Brazil right now, prices are up quite significantly.","In the U.S., we have a situation where we have a number of contracts that are under a formula. And as those input numbers, input costs, go down, that becomes a net drag on pricing. Of course, our input cost that we actually experience come down at the same time. So, it's not really compressing margin, as you might think about pricing. That's just reflecting the natural ebb and flow of an index. So, definitely, in our space, there's certainly a higher percentage increase in Latin America.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Harrison with Global Hunter Securities.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Good morning, Mike.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Corning, I was wondering if you could walk through what your LOX\/LIN utilization look like by region. And in the case of any improvement, is that improvement just volume related or are there any capacity reductions going on?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","So, for the most part, our position right now is, let's say we're in the 70%s on a global basis. So, a little bit higher in the U.S. and Canada, a little bit lower in Latin America. The movement there or let's say the trend line going up is really just going with underlying volumes at this point. Not really significant capacity coming out of the system at this point.","And I would say, in general, if you look at it, so LOX\/LIN\/LAR up in North America, up a bit in Europe as well. I think it reflects just an overall thing that's happening here in Air Products. I mean, this is a company that's going through a huge transformation. Think about where we were a year ago. Think about that graph we saw earlier about our EBITDA trend. I mean, we've been through a big change. And I think it reflects overall, that people are energized by what's happening, and our teams are out there and they're pushing the sales, they're interacting with our customers, and I think we've got some momentum from that. And that's going to slowly impact our overall loading. But it's hard to beat, of course, the global economic environment.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","All right. And then a question on the hydrogen business. You've talked in the past about the earnings impact of lower natural gas prices in hydrogen. Have you taken any steps over the last year or two years to modify some of your contracts, so that you're a little bit more insulated from the earnings impact of lower natural gas prices, or is it still the case that you keep whatever efficiencies you can generate, and that means fewer dollars at lower natural gas prices?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. As you can imagine, these are long-term contracts tied to big assets. And it's not super easy to go ahead and modify them. As well as if you think about what we're really interested in at the end of the day is earnings, is profit, okay? And so, there's not a lot to be gained in heavily trying to reengineer that in terms of your face time with the customer. That might change a ratio for us, but it's not going to really change EPS for us, let's say that.","So, we're very focused on the things that most drive value for ourselves and for our shareholders, and really not so much an effort trying to reengineer or re-jig the current contracts.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Mike, I think that during the call, I think Scott mentioned that the effect of the lower prices on profitability was minimal.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Right. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","It affects our sales quite a bit, but the effect on profitability was not that huge.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, Mike.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","One more question.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","One more question, please.","Operator","Okay. We'll take our final question from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. With respect to your \u2013 the new plant that comes that's in the backlog for Korea, would you help us understand what it was that allowed you to get this plant? And then, if you would maybe qualitatively or quantitatively help us understand the type of returns you're looking at that plant versus returns you had in the past.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll answer the return question. You know that we are not going to take any project less than 10% return. So, the return was higher than that. But in terms of the \u2013 we are under constraints from our customer about how much we can talk about it but I'd like Corning to make some comments.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. So, this is a reflection of having a product line approach. We've \u2013 we know the electronics industry, the semiconductor industry very well. We built a standard set of plants that are geared to deriving or delivering the nitrogen, adjust the pressures and purities these guys need, and I think it just reflects the ability to take that (01:03:32) and replicate it. These are plants that we've built before in other locations, and in some cases, for those very same customer, and we'll now be doing it for them in this location. I think it's the power of \u2013 when we talk about focusing on the core, this is an example of that. Focusing on an area of strength and continuing to grow from strength to strength.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. Understood. Thank you. And then just a follow-up with respect to your cost reductions and efficiency programs. Obviously, you put all these together when the economy maybe was not so dire, or the outlook wasn't so dire, and things have slowed down in other parts of the world. So, once you're finished with the $600 million or so reduction in efficiency gains, do you expect there to be other opportunities given where the economy is now?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","We are committed to continuous improvement. So, once we get this extended in the next four years, then we will start thinking about how we can make our operations even better. So, we are totally committed to that. Okay?","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay.

Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter 2016 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and in today's earnings release.","As you know, on October 1, Air Products completed the spin-off of Electronic Materials as Versum Materials, and we continue to make progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik. The Q4 and FY 2016 full-year results we are sharing today include both EMD and PMD in continuing operations. Our guidance for Q1 and FY 2017 does not include EMD and we have provided forward guidance both with and without the PMD business.","You will see that we also provided an estimate of the comparable prior-year quarter and full-year Air Products results. We continue to evaluate the progress of the PMD sale to determine when we will report PMD in discontinued operations.","Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.","I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter and another year of excellent results. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on executing our strategic Five-Point Plan. For the year, we delivered what we had promised you a year-ago. We had earnings per share of $7.55, which is up 14% over last year and $0.05 higher than the top end of the initial guidance range we provided you last October.","As for the quarter, we delivered record earnings per share of $2.01, which is up $0.10 over last year and it is the ninth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth. I think it's important to know that we have been consistent.","For the year, we also improved our margins by 400 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 180 basis points to 13.8%. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to continue to be the best in the industry.","Now, please turn to slide number 3. Our safety performance for the year showed improvement over last year, that's good news. However, I do believe that the only acceptable goal for us is zero accidents and incidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injury or incident. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of everyone.","Now, please turn to slide number 4, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.","Now, please turn to slide number 5. Here, you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long-term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates.","In addition, Air Products has a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.","Now, please turn to slide number 6, our Five-Point Plan that we announced two years ago. Our strong performance is a direct result of our focus on executing this Plan.","The first point of Plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to a spinoff our Material Technologies business, and we said that we expected to complete that spinoff by end of fiscal year 2016, which was the end of September of this year. Although we changed the scope of this spinoff earlier this year, I'm very pleased to say that many people at Air Products worked very hard to make this happen, and now Versum is a successful, a stand-alone company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of October 1.","We continue to make progress on the sale of our performance additive materials (sic) [Performance Materials] to Evonik and consistent with what we have said before we are still targeting to close this transaction before the end of this calendar year.","I truly believe this is excellent for the employees of the three companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business and will grow in the future. PMD employees will be core to a world-class material company at Evonik and Versum Materials employees are now an independent best-in-class electronic materials company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe these actions will also create shareholder value in the long-term.","We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our Plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million means that we have visibility and control to ensure that we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.","I am very optimistic about the growth potential for our core Industrial Gases businesses, especially opportunities in the large oxygen and hydrogen plants.","Now, please turn to slide number 7. There you can see the result of this quarter and the fiscal year for our three key metrics. Once again, for the third consecutive quarter, we are proud to have achieved our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward.","Now, please turn to slide number 8. Here you can see a summary of our performance for the year. Scott will go through the details but I just want to point out that despite lower sales due to lower energy and currency, we improved EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points, increased EPS by 14%, and return on capital employed is up 180 basis points to 13.8%. The operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefit of restructuring actions we took last year enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.","Now, please turn to slide number 9, my favorite slide, where you can see our quarterly progress. As you will note, we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900 basis points in the last 2.5 years.","On slide number 10, you can see several of our fiscal year accomplishments. The worldwide team at Air Products delivered strong financial results while staying focused on bringing very large projects on-stream successfully, winning new projects, spinning off Versum Materials, and working towards closing the sale of PMD to Evonik. A great example of commitment and focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contributions.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss our results in detail. Then, I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 11. In summary for the year productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest volume growth and currency headwinds. Total sales declined 4%, driven by unfavorable currency and energy pass-through impacts of 3% each while underlying sales increased by 2% driven by higher volumes in Gases-Asia and our Jazan sale of equipment project in Saudi Arabia.","Operating income increased 16%; operating margin was up 400 basis points to 23.1%; and EBITDA margin was up 420 basis points to 34.4%, driven primarily by better cost performance. Only 50 basis points of the operating margin increase came from lower energy pass-through. Diluted EPS increased by 14% and our return on capital employed improved by 180 basis points to 13.8%.","On slide 12, we show you our distributable cash flow of more than $11 per share. We believe this measure more than EPS is the true measure of the wealth we are creating for our shareholders.","As a result of our strong performance in FY 2016, our distributable cash flow increased by $200 million or 9%. This, combined with lower growth capital spending in FY 2016 generated free cash flow of over $900 million, which is up $500 million over last year.","Now please turn to slide 13 to review our full year EPS. Year-on-year EPS growth of $0.95, or 14%, was driven primarily by lower cost and improved pricing net of raw material costs. Volume growth in Gases-Asia was largely offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. And in our sale of equipment businesses, higher Jazan project revenue was more than offset by lower activity in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses.","Price mix improvement of $0.29 was delivered by Gases-Americas, Gases-Europe, and Materials Technologies. And cost contributed $0.94 as focused productivity actions in all our segments more than offset inflation. This was more than enough to overcome unfavorable currency and foreign exchange headwinds of $0.16 and $0.11 unfavorable from items below operating income detailed on the slide.","Now please turn to slide 14 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. Sales of $2.5 billion increased 1% versus last year as higher volumes more than offset lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 1% each. Volumes were 3% higher primarily due to continued progress on our Jazan project.","Somewhat offsetting Jazan is softness in LNG and in other sale of equipment businesses as existing projects are completed while less new projects are added to the backlog. In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases-Asia, but were offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. Materials Technologies volumes rebounded nicely this quarter.","Pricing was largely unchanged versus prior year. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $855 million improved by 9% and operating income of $584 million improved by 13%. EBITDA margin of 34.7% and operating margin of 23.7% improved by 250 basis points and 260 basis points respectively as we continue to execute on our Five-Point Plan.","All three regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies improved margins again this quarter. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 20 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Versus prior year, net income increased by 11% and earnings per share grew 10%.","Now, please turn to slide 15. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow. So we were pleased to see that our free cash flow was $264 million this quarter, up $138 million versus last year due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx.","Turning to slide 16, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q4 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that total $0.17 per share or $44 million pre-tax. We saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $23 million for legal and advisory fees and tax cost. And we recorded a loss on early debt retirement of $7 million as part of our debt for debt exchange to facilitate the Versum spin-off.","Also included this quarter is $14 million for position eliminations and pension settlement costs. We expect to see cost action and pension settlement costs continue through next year. Further actions will be part of a second $300 million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest Materials Technologies.","Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in an appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.","Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $2.01 increased $0.18 per share or 10% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.06 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.03. Net cost performance was $0.13 favorable, primarily driven by our productivity actions.","Currency translation and foreign exchange gains combined was $0.02 favorable as currency translation impacts were $0.03 unfavorable and foreign exchange losses from the prior-year of $0.05 did not repeat. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to lower capitalized interest and a higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02.","And finally I'd like to make a few comments on our 30 September balance sheet. As you know, as part of the Versum spin, approximately $1 billion of debt was raised by Versum, which was then paid out to Air Products. This payment came in the form of $550 million in cash and was equal to the Versum tax basis and approximately $425 million as part of the debt to debt exchange, which we used to retire commercial paper.","This all occurred as planned prior to the end of September. The net effect of these transactions is that Air Products has $550 million more cash and approximately $425 million less debt as of September 30. However, since Versum debt was issued in September, but Versum did not become a separate entity until October 1, Air Products consolidated balance sheet includes the Versum debt.","As you can see in total, cash is up about $1 billion relative to June 30 in part due to Versum and also due to cash generation from our business including Jazan.","Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. Fiscal 2016 was another very strong year for the Industrial Gas business and I would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control and in particular, for exceeding our productivity goals.","On slide 17, you can see the significant EBITDA margin improvement that we delivered in each of our three regional businesses in 2016, up over 600 basis points in Americas, up over 500 basis points in EMEA and up over 250 basis points in Asia. This strong performance was delivered in a challenging external environment with weak economic conditions and currency headwinds. We stay focused on safety and deliver the benefits from our Taking the Lead productivity program.","As you know, our business is inherently local. That is why we moved to a regional structure and incentive plan two years ago. Every employee, every distribution truck, every plant matters. The opportunity to improve our network design touches on all three of these. For example, we recently announced the start up of a new liquid plant in Carrington, UK. This plant is not just more efficient than the old plant, it's sized to allow us to consolidate all Northwest England liquid bulk operations in Carrington and close a second older liquefier that was just 35 miles away. We have made great progress and are even more confident about our ability to deliver future benefits.","We're also excited to continue our success in winning new projects. We announced a project in the U.S. and one in South Korea within the last two weeks.","Now, please turn to slide 18 for a review of our Gases Americas fourth quarter results. Our profit growth and significant margin expansion was driven by our Taking the Lead productivity efforts across all sub-regions. Sales of $877 million were down 3% versus last year on lower volumes. Latin American volumes were down close to 10%, which lowered overall Americas volumes by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America.","North America volumes were lowered overall \u2013 lowered overall Americas volumes by 1%, primarily due to a weakness in steel. Sequential volumes were impacted by planned customer maintenance outages.","Pricing, energy pass-through and currency were all flat versus prior year. We did see a sequential increase in energy pass-through revenue as natural gas prices increased. Operating income of $225 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $352 million was up 7% versus last year as the benefits of our Taking the Lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes.","Operating margin of 25.6% was up 250 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 350 basis points. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher natural gas prices and lower volumes.","And as I mentioned, we are excited to have signed an agreement with The Chemours Company to supply multiple industrial gases to their titanium dioxide production facility in New Johnsonville, Tennessee. We will build a new plant expected on stream in the fall 2018 that will supply Chemours and also produce additional liquid argon to serve the northern and central regions of the United States.","Now, please turn to slide 19. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the team continues to deliver strong profit growth despite continued volume weakness and currency headwinds. Versus last year, sales of $414 million were down 10% on 4% lower volumes, a negative 3% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 3% impact from currency.","The liquid volumes were down in all four sub-regions with more than half of the decline due to lower wholesale volumes. Packaged gases demand was down broadly. Other than the obvious currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote has had much impact on our business this quarter. Operating income of $98 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $154 million was up 2% as our productivity actions more than offset the currency headwinds. Operating margin of 23.7% and EBITDA margin of 37.2% were both up over 400 basis points.","Lower energy pass-through improved operating margin by about 70 points meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 330 basis points excluding lower energy pass-through.","Please turn to slide 20, Gases-Asia. Volume growth continues from new plants and our base business, while our productivity actions enhance our profitability. Sales of $449 million were up 5% as volume growth of 7% was partially offset by a negative 2% currency impact. Roughly two-thirds of the volume increase was from new plants including an increase in energy pass-through revenue.","Our merchant business was up mid single digits across Asia, and our China retail LOX\/LIN business was again up double digits, as we've improved the quality of this business. Despite continuing price pressure in helium there are signs of improvement in the China LOX\/LIN business, but we still expect the overcapacity to remain for some time.","Operating income of $110 million was up 5% and EBITDA of $172 million was up 4%. The profit growth was slightly muted, as we had a positive on-site customer catch-up payment last year. The increase in energy pass-through revenue is at no margin, and we had headwinds from currency and incentive compensation.","Our productivity programs continue to deliver. Operating margin of 24.5% and EBITDA margin of 38.2% were roughly flat versus last year. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher incentive compensation and higher seasonal power costs. Finally, we just announced earlier this week, a new air separation unit in Ulsan, South Korea to support pipeline and merchant demand growth.","We have been serving customers in the region for nearly 30 years and look forward to continuing our excellent track record. I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as costs associated with the industrial gas business that are not region specific.","Sales were up, as we recognized over $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASUs sale of equipment this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASUs. Segment profits were up as we recognized profit on the Jazan profit. The profit this quarter includes a cumulative catch up related to project activity during the full year. We do expect to book revenue and profit for Jazan in FY 2017.","Now please turn to slide 21. And I'll turn the call over to Simon for a comment on our other business results.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Corning. As I mentioned earlier, we completed the spin-off of our Electronic Materials business as Versum Materials on October 1 and are making progress on the sale of our Performance Materials business to Evonik. Both of these businesses are included in Air Products continuing operations for Q4 2016.","On slide 21, you can see that Materials Technologies, which includes both EMD and PMD continued to show strong results with sales, volumes, profits and margins all up versus last year.","Please turn to slide 22 for the EMD results as reported within Air Products. I will make some brief comments and the Versum Materials team will address their results in more detail when they hold their earnings call. Sales of $248 million were up 7% on 7% higher volumes driven by strength in Advanced Materials and Delivery Systems. EBITDA of $83 million was up 5% and operating income of $70 million was up 11% versus last year.","Now please turn to slide 23 for a review of our PMD results. Sales of $267 million were up 4% on 8% higher volumes partially offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by polyurethane additive strength in spray, appliance and construction markets as well as epoxy strength in coatings and non-residential construction markets. Specialty additives volumes were flat as stronger coatings volumes offset weakness due to the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil. Overall prices were down given broader petrochemical driven deflation but this was more than offset by lower raw material costs.","EBITDA of $74 million was up 29% and EBITDA margin of 27.8% was up 550 basis points. Operating income of $68 million was up 35%, and operating margin of 25.3% was up 580 basis points, primarily driven by productivity and favorable price\/raw material balance.","Finally, our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which were not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on significantly lower LNG project activity and profits were down as the impact from the lower sales more than offset lower costs.","As we've said the lack of customers' decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business, about a $0.10 headwind for FY 2016. We expect a further, approximately $0.25 headwind in FY 2017 versus FY 2016.","Now please turn to slide 24, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you again, Simon. The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our Five-Point Strategic Plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarter and for fiscal year 2017 on two bases, one is with our PMD business and the second is without the PMD business.","As I said before, nothing has changed. We continue to make progress on the sale of PMD and we are still targeting to close before the end of this calendar year. However, since we are still going through the regulatory approval process, PMD is not currently in discontinued operations. Therefore, we are providing guidance both including and excluding PMD.","You can see that we have also provided an estimate for continuing operation EPS result for quarter one fiscal 2016 and total fiscal year 2016, so that you can compare our next year to what we actually achieved last year.","On the basis that excludes the PMD business, which is our core industrial gas business, our guidance for fiscal year 2017 is for earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.50, up 9% to 13% over last year. And also on the basis that excludes PMD, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, our guidance is for earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, up 3% to 10% over last year.","We expect our CapEx, excluding any significant acquisition, to be about $1.2 billion. Our EPS guidance is consistent with this CapEx guidance. In other words, it does not include any acquisitions. And while things could always change, our guidance also does not include any positive effect from share repurchase.","I would like to stress these points again. Our guidance is based on our core Industrial Gases portfolio as it is today. Therefore it does not include any upside from any share repurchase or future acquisitions.","Our fiscal year guidance is consistent with our long-term goal to improve Air Products earnings per share by 10% per year over the long-term. In the last two years, we have delivered much more than that and we are going to strive to continue to deliver 10% earnings per share growth every year.","And despite the weak economy, a key reason we remain confident we can continue to develop a strong performance is the success of our $600 million cost improvement program that we announced two and a half years ago. We have fully delivered the first $300 million, and in terms of the second $300 million we delivered over $75 million in 2016 which is twice what we had promised you before and we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost savings in addition to that in 2017, again ahead of our previous commitments.","To wrap up, please turn to slide 25 for our priorities as we move Air Products forward. While we will always stay focused on improving our existing business, the major restructuring of Air Products is behind us and our focus is now on profitable growth. We have the balance sheet capacity now to take advantage of the very exciting growth opportunities we see, including accretive and complementary acquisitions focused on our core Industrial Gases business, and large projects around the world driven by market demand for more energy, environmental improvements, and emerging market growth.","And since we'll have a significant amount of cash at our disposal, we can be successful with these large opportunities, while we maintain our current A credit rating and continue our commitment to grow our dividend every year. And finally, we will consider share repurchases, if the market provides a compelling opportunity.","Let me say in closing that our people continue to step up and deliver. I want to sincerely thank them for their dedication and commitment, and the hard work that they are doing everyday to provide excellent service to our customers and make Air Products the best industrial gas company in the world. Without their efforts, we would not have been able to deliver these results.","And now, we would be delighted to answer any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Impressive guide given that it doesn't include the cash deployment, could you kind of talk us through the moving pieces that get you that double-digit core growth?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes, absolutely. As I said, we are committed to deliver an additional $100 million of cost savings. That by itself is about $0.35. And then in addition to that, we have new plants that we have built, that are continuing to come on-stream, so we will have organic growth. Therefore, the combination of productivity and organic growth that we see based on the plants that we see coming on-stream, that is what gives us the confidence to deliver the results that we're talking about next year. Because that means that next year, we are not making any assumptions for any significant economic growth worldwide, we will have a currency headwind, but we feel very good about our productivity programs. Our people did a great job in delivering the $75 million more than that last year. We are confident that we will get that and on top of that with the growth rate that we see, we are \u2013 as you know, we have always been committed to promise what we can deliver and usually deliver more than what we can promise.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And then, obviously can you comment on the potential impact of another round of consolidation among the global major gas companies? Do you think the regulatory environment is supportive of that deal, and what kind of would be the impact if it went through?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I don't want to comment on what other people are doing or might do, but Air Products is focused on a strategy which is based on organic growth and productivity improvement, and we will continue to execute that strategy. What other people might do, I don't think it will have much of an effect on us at all.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, fellas.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Duffy. How are you?","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good. Thanks. Probably the biggest question I am getting on your guys lately and Seifi, I'd love to get your color on this is, obviously assuming that the deal to Evonik goes through, you guys will be sitting on a big pile of cash come next year. How should we think about your ability to employ that, maybe over the proceeding 18 months or so?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Obviously, we are committed to do that. We \u2013 sitting on top of a little bit of cash for a rainy day is okay, but sitting on top of $3 billion of cash is obviously not what we intend to do. We do have \u2013 we believe we do have plans to deploy that cash properly, we are not in a hurry to do that, we are not going to do anything rash, but we feel very good about that.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then there has been a lot of noise in China this year around some of the rules and regulations in coal mining, the number of days they can run plants has changed a couple of times. Has that impacted at all the way you view the long-term coal gasification opportunity or has that impacted any of the current business you have in that industry?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, Duffy, I honestly think that there is a little bit of a confusion about what those rules are. What we see from those, we are close to that, we are on the ground. We see absolutely no effect and actually we see positive developments. We are very optimistic about those big projects, we think they will happen and we don't see anything in the Chinese government policy that would affect the kind of things that we want to do in terms of clean coal and coal gasification in China.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Terrific. Thank you, fellas.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, everyone.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Vince.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Hi, Vincent.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. So, Latin America, you called out some weakness and then also EMEA had minus 4% volume growth. It seems like those were a little bit weaker sequentially than at least we thought. Can you just talk about what dynamics are there and then what might have changed, particularly I guess on Europe and the minus 4% volume?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Absolutely. I think, I'd like Corning to address that. Corning, please?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. So, as I said in my comments, the big challenge there was in the liquid bulk area. If we think about the merchant business, there is two spaces, packaged gases and liquid bulk.","Packaged gases for sometimes have been impacted just by slowing construction activity, metals fab. But, we saw a drop-off in this quarter in liquid bulk larger for us than what we had in packaged gases. But more than 50% of that was in wholesale volumes, and that goes a little bit to our drive, to just start driving an improved quality of our business, and our goal moving forward would be not to reload that business with wholesale volumes, instead shift that to retail volume for us.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Corning, you might want to also mention about the effect in Europe, about the effect of August in terms of sequentially.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, fair enough. So, if we think about in the purely sequential look we go through \u2013 you just have to keep in mind that the holiday season in Europe is in this previous quarter with August. So, I think, that's a big part of the drop off there. If you're looking at the raw numbers, you've also got the impact that shifted with currency with the Brexit vote, which is the one part of that, that we've seen. And I would say, overall, you take through and you say shifting to a more of a retail based net business. I think, we're well positioned there.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, with this drop off in wholesale volumes, should we assume that there is going to be some volume weakness for the next couple of quarters until you lap that?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","I wouldn't see \u2013 yeah, I wouldn't see that coming back overnight agreed.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Especially as we are pushing that to retail volume.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Moving on we'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, P.J. How are you today?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good. So for a long time, Industrial Gas executives believed that big M&A is not possible, but that notion is being challenged. Do you have any interest in big M&A or would you rather sit back and buy any pieces that may come out?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","P.J., I don't want to comment on what our competitors are doing, but we think pursuing big M&A among the four major industrial gas companies is a foolish idea and we are not going to pursue foolish ideas. So we are not going, we don't have any plans to participate, we'll sit back and if anything happens, there certainly will be a lot of pieces that comes out. We have a lot of cash that would be kind of Christmas for us if it happens.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Really thank you for that color.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you sir.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And just a quick question on your CapEx, which is going up in 2017 versus 2016, as you start up some of these projects. What kind of EPS contribution do you expect from new projects in 2017? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","From the projects that are \u2013 any future projects that we do whenever we announce the CapEx, you should assume that will have a minimum of 10% return. We have made that commitment. The projects that we have on-stream coming on in 2017 will be a combination of the new projects we have approved like Big River Steel and a combination of projects which were approved many years ago. That combination of the two as I said the new ones will have 10% and the old ones will probably have an average of about 5% return.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Very helpful.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Moving on we'll take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, David. How are you doing these days?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good, thank you, very good. Seifi just looking again 2017 in terms of pricing benefits in 2017, how should we think about those from an EPS perspective?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, David, as you know very well, we cannot, should not and would not comment on pricing. I think I would be very hesitant to start giving you any specific number but you would expect that, that is one of the things that we do. We are focused on improving productivity, we are focused on improving our pricing and our pricing can improve not only by increasing prices to cover inflation, but it will improve based on what Corning was talking about in change of the mix, in terms of going from wholesale to direct sale and all of that. So there is some element of pricing in next year's guidance, yes.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just on the deployment of the cash and the capital, as you bid for these projects, are they competitive bid situations or are they more one-off negotiated transactions you're looking at?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","David, I think you should assume that everything we do is a competitive situation. I don't think that for these large projects, any of the customers would just want to do a private deal with us. But we are prepared for that, we bring a lot of value to our customers not only in terms of pricing, but in terms of all of the other services we provide. So we're prepared for competition, but we remain very optimistic that we have an advantage, and we have won a lot of projects, some of it unfortunately we cannot announce, because our customers would like to keep that confidential. But we are winning more than our fair share of projects in the last two years. I'm not worried about that at all.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. By what percentage is Jazan complete? And for your Indian hydrogen project of 165 million cubic feet per day, I mean that comes on in phases, how much comes on in 2017?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We expect our project in India to come on-stream approximately in the first half of \u2013 calendar 2017. So there will be less than half a year contribution from that project in our 2017 numbers. As for Jazan, we have made progress, and I will be hesitant to publicly talk about percentage complete. But I can say that we are moving on plan on schedule on that project, and we are obviously very optimistic and our people are delivering on that. And we have a great customer in Aramco, they are being very helpful to us and they are pushing us obviously to get the project done as soon as possible and we are on plan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then for my follow-up. If it turns out in the course of 2017, there is nothing that you are able to buy. And it also turns out that your share price is flat, would your share price then represent a compelling opportunity at the end of the year or it wouldn't?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, it depends on what the share price is. I mean if you are asking me that would we buy shares at $133, I'm not sure I want to comment on that, but...","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Anything \u2013 Jeff, you know better than I do the events in the world, I mean what is the market going to look like two weeks from now. A lot of things can happen. So we \u2013 the good thing is that we have the cash and we will watch what happens.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Moving on we'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect, thank you. Just an extension of your comments right there, you've obviously spoken about kind of the key macro and some of the political risks in the context of capital deployment, but can you just give us an update on how you're actually thinking about this versus let's say three months to six months ago, are there any changes in your expectations overall opportunities or evaluations broadly particularly outside of the U.S.? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I guess, I would have to characterize it that I am more optimistic than I was six months ago about our ability to deploy the cash. But I do want to stress that there are certain events in the world that can change everything upside down, and I think it's very prudent for us rather than jumping in and doing something this minute to give ourselves a few months to see how everything settles down with the U.S. election, and with the Brexit and all of that, and then we will make the appropriate moves.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. And as a quick follow-up, within the Gases in Asia, you're seeing some decent volume growth, and you are now holding price flat on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Can you just talk a little bit more about the broad drivers in the market specifically, any changes in merchant capacity and\/or strategy that's helping the overall results? Thanks.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Corning, would you like to...?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So let me answer that. I'm not sure, I'm going to go into all of our strategy and want to discuss that in a public setting, but maybe just to give you a little bit more color to it. So there remains significant overcapacity in the market and there remains probably over 5,000 tons to 10,000 tons of capacity that's either under construction or it's been idled or people delayed startup. So I think the overcapacity story is there for a while but a positive thing for us has been for several years now, we've made a strong drive to drive the retail portion of this business and you could see that's been working for us and that gives us an improvement on the mix.","All in all I would say the pricing environment in LOX\/LIN is slightly improved, you don't see that in the overall number because of the impact of helium. I just say, we didn't put that in the prepared comments because I'd really like to see how this plays out a few quarters into the future before we declare a trend there. So all in all though, I'd say that's positive, it's positive for us to be able to get the retail volume growth and I think that's all in all a very good thing for Air Products going forward, a lot of confidence in the team there.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","If I may just add to Corning's comment that we are very happy to be in China and we think we have a very good future here.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Moving on, we'll now take our next question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Seifi, you mentioned in your remarks, your pipeline has some large oxygen and hydrogen opportunities in it. Can you just comment on what portion of those would you see as standalone plans versus potential pipeline bolt-on projects? And how would you see the \u2013 those opportunities relative to where they've been over the last few years, are they \u2013 are there more or less and where?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Most of the opportunities that we see are in U.S. Gulf Coast and in China, and some in Europe. Most of the opportunities are \u2013 some of the opportunities are on our pipeline and especially our hydrogen pipeline, but a lot of the opportunities are standalone plants, large plants, supplying significant amounts of oxygen and hydrogen \u2013 and nitrogen to coal gasification, refineries, and all of that live features (54:14) and project. There are not that many there you are \u2013 as you might say we are hanging on a liquid capacity.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And...","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes, sir.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, thank you for that. Just with respect to your $100 million cost reduction target in fiscal 2017, can you just comment on what are the key projects that will be driving that?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Those key projects are under the title of what we call Taking the Lead project that Corning has been leading and they are absolutely focused on operational improvements in our production and in our distribution and some \u2013 and those are the main key areas. But, I'd like to comment \u2013 Corning to comment \u2013 elaborate on that please?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We've tried to in each of the recent earnings releases just give a concrete example of one thing that we're working on. The reality of this business though it's a very distributed business, right? We don't have world class plants where you export all around the world from one site, we have over 700 plants. And so it's a business of transactions and many plants and as Seifi says sometimes, the 10,000 little things. And so a big part of this is motivating the team and keeping ourselves focused on executing across those 10,000 things. I'd say that the move towards a regional structure has dramatically improved that, including the operating control in the region and the move to an incentive plan based on that same regional structure has been a big part of this as well, but all of that together really comes down to just the commitment of the people and the focus to deliver on this.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","If I may just add to that, as we have said many times before. We do have very detailed programs region by region, in terms of what they need to do. Based on what we accomplished in 2016, I am very confident that we will deliver at least $100 million next year.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","If I could just jump in on this because this is a topic we're really happy about. We're all wearing in this room, these buttons, right with our four S's, the new culture at Air Products, and we have those plans just like Seifi talked about. And we beat them. And I think it goes one of those S's for us is speed and those regional teams we got out of the way, they were empowered, they were motivated, and they went and they got it done. And I think we are very proud around the world of what these groups have done. But I think it's a sign, right of embracing a new culture here at Air Products.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners","Yes, good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning Kevin.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners","My question relates to \u2013 good morning. With regard to Jazan what sort of incremental profit contribution might we expect in the fiscal 2017 versus 2016? And perhaps you can elaborate on the fourth quarter you just reported, and the shift from a red number to a black? I think the press release indicated a cumulative catch-up? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure. I obviously cannot and should not comment on the profitability of the Jazan project. For 2017, we do not have a significant amount of contribution, but it \u2013 there will be some contribution. And quite honestly, it will depend on the exact progress that we make on all of that. But there will be some.","In 2016, we did not recognize, although we were recognizing sales throughout the year, we did not recognize profit, because we wanted to get some kind of a, more of a sure footing that the project is moving forward. As you know, there has been a lot of talk about shutting down projects in Saudi Arabia and all of that, and we wanted to make sure that this project doesn't get cancelled, and then we would have to reverse profit on all of that. But then by fourth quarter, it became obvious that we have made enough progress that you should recognize some and that's what we did.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Moving on we'll take our next question from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. How big is electronics now for the remaining gases business, and were your nitrogen sales to electronics roughly up in line with Versum or the EMD volume numbers that you presented?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","The size of that business order of magnitude is about $0.5 billion, and we were up 11%. So, we are doing well there.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Mike Sison from KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Seifi, when you gave your outlook for 2017, you highlighted cost of new projects and \u2013 and is there upside in the event the industrial world does get better? And maybe just kind of your thoughts that doesn't sound, do you think it could get better, is it stable, is it getting worse? Just surprised that, you wouldn't add that as a component of potential growth next year.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, the thing is that, as compared to, and I mean we are operating the same boat compared to our competitors. I mean, we are delivering double-digit growth while other people are showing negative growth, so we are doing something right.","With respect to next year, we are \u2013 there is a possibility that we will do better than what we have given you as a guidance depending on the economy and all that. But I just want to remind everybody that, we are dealing with some significant worldwide events that we have to see how they will develop. We have given you a guidance on the basis that barring any significant disruptions, we will be able to deliver that and we have \u2013 that's the way we operate.","Now, the economic conditions can get better once the U.S. election is over and people are not sitting on the fence, then, yeah, it is possible that we will do better than that. But the one thing that I can assure you is that, we don't operate on the basis of just delivering the guidance. We do our best to deliver whatever we can. That's kind of our goal.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. A question on the opportunity to buy captive ASUs. Could you say, do you think the multiple for such acquisitions would be higher, lower or the same as other M&A opportunities. And also could you frame any synergy potential of such captive ASU acquisitions?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","On that one, unfortunately, I can't give you a general answer, because it will depend on the specific situations. But what you said can apply, and it can be a specific situation that there is significant synergies. Because we already have two plants there and an addition of another two plants or three plants will add value. So, sorry, that I can't give you a general answer, but you can be, rest assured that we would only do those, if they are in line with our goal of getting a return on our \u2013 on the capital that we employ which is not less than 10%.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And can you also give us a sense for any stranded cost that you still have in 2017? What the timeframe would be for eliminating those and how they affect the cadence of your earnings progression in 2017?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, we have said that those stranded costs could be in the order of magnitude of $20 million. We have programs for eliminating those in the next year and a half and our guidance obviously reflects that those costs are still with us and we need to work to eliminate those.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Don. How are you today?","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Very good, thank you. Question on your FX assumptions within your guidance. Currency was a $0.16 drag in fiscal 2016, you got some sterling exposure. Just wondering what kind of headwind you're assuming in your 2017 guidance?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","I think the number is about $0.05, but the expert on this is Scott. So, Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, that's a tall order Seifi. Hi, Don. So, just to remind everybody how we look at currency. We don't try to speculate, we take the latest rates and we just project that forward. So, when we do that from where we are today into 2017, and then compare full year 2017 against 2016, we'd have a headwind of about $0.05 to $0.10, that's for the full year. And then on a quarter basis, we do the same approach, just move things sideways. We would have, in the first quarter, both sequentially as well as versus prior year in Q1, about a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind, principally driven by the pound.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then on the project Seifi, you mentioned that you're still working through some projects that were signed before you arrived. Are those pretty much over by the end of 2017, and what's the total \u2013 where does the backlog stand today versus where it was at the beginning of fiscal 2016.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We had a detailed chart on this thing, on the slide that we have...","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Slide 29.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Slide 28.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, slide 28. So, you can see \u2013 and I'm sure you know very well, which ones they signed before and which ones they signed after. They will not all be over in 2017 because some of them are delayed and it will drag on into 2018 also.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Moving on, we will take our next question from Michael Harrison from Seaport Global Securities.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Seifi, you mentioned that you felt like you were gaining \u2013 winning more than your fair share of new projects in large on-site business. I was wondering if you can talk about the North American merchant business and what you're seeing in terms of new account growth there? And in particular, can you maybe comment on what the core LOX\/LIN volume look like in the quarter and what the outlook is for fiscal 2017?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure. I think Corning can answer that very easily. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes. Thank you for the question. So, LOX\/LIN if we were going to look at that let's just say it's the most generic product goes into the most \u2013 largest number of industries it's probably the best sort of bellwether of everything. Year-on-year that was flat for us, however sequentially we were up about 2% so showing some positive momentum there. Even in that year-on-year flat however, I'd say that during the course of the year, we did make some adjustments in our portfolio as part of our Take the Lead program. We also had one situation, not exactly the same as Carrington what I talked about but where we did shut down a liquefier and we're able to shift some load around but that also did involve shutting some customers.","So, all in all I think, approximately the best indication is just the sequential moving forward which gave us 2% and I see that as a net positive for us and I think a pretty good reflection of what's going in North America.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then you mentioned that within the corporate segment that LNG business was going to be a $0.25 EPS headwind next year. Is there anything that they could change in the market, that could swing that or do you have pretty good visibility based on the projects that are in the pipeline now that that's going to be weaker no matter what happens?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","No. I think, the guidance that we have given you about $0.25 is based on what we see, but there are things that can happen that can change that because a lot of these projects. We have won the projects, but the oil and gas companies have put a hold on them as you know very well because of the situation. They can change if the oil prices significantly change. They can change their mind, they can release those and therefore, we can start working on them. So the possibility of that, I don't see being great but it is possible.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yes.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","But the $0.25 is real and it is based on what we have. So I'm glad that you brought that up because if you take that $0.25 into account, then we're actually giving a pretty good guidance in terms of growth next year, but that's based on what we see right now.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And moving on, we'll take our final question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Congratulations, you've got a pretty good engine going now with this business.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","A longer-term question, as your business mix continues to shift towards being more and more on-site, have you had any indication from either your large customers or from the rating agencies that their tolerance for leverage would change given the better \u2013 should the better or more stable mix of the business?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, that is something that we are hoping that would be the case but we have to wait and see, but we are pushing towards more on-site because then you get a more stable revenue growth and a more stable profitability, but we are paying attention to all parts of our business whether it's large on-sites or merchant business and our packaged gases business in the areas of the world where we are strong. So we are not neglecting any part of the business but the trend seems to be more towards the large on-sites. And obviously if we win one of those projects it adds a lot to that part of the business.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And then just lastly, are you seeing sort of \u2013 as you have early discussions with customers about the next cycle of projects in 2018, 2020 and so on. It looks as if the size of projects just keeps getting larger. Will we get to the point where you're seeing sort of one-off, $500 million to $1 billion project agreements?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I can actually see bigger than that. There are projects that you would, like Jazan $2 billion and there are projects that might require $4 billion. So you're right, the trend is towards larger projects and that is why having the balance sheet that you can do those projects becomes very important and that has been our target because we saw that trend before and that is one of the reasons that we wanted to restructure and make sure that Air Products has a bulletproof, solid balance sheet that we can take on those mega projects. You're very right about that.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay.

And I want to emphasize that the most diverse in our goal refers to our people. We value a diverse workforce.","Now, please turn to slide number 5. You can see our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times over the last four years. But it is worth repeating because we continue to be focused on shareholder value, capital allocation, and an empowered and decentralized organization.","Now, please turn to slide number 6. It was almost four years ago that I shared our original Five-Point Plan: we have successfully focused on Air Products' core industrial gases business; we have restructured the organization; changed the culture; controlled capital and costs; and aligned our rewards. We have done what we promised to do.","Now, please turn to the slide number 7. Our journey is never complete, and it's time to evolve our Five-Point Plan to guide us over the coming years. Let me explain each of the points on this slide one at a time. First, from the left side, in terms of sustaining our lead, we will keep our focus on safety. We have done well, but even one injury is too many. Accidents don't happen by themselves. Every incident or accident is preventable. We want to be the best-in-class in everything we do. We need to be the best-in-class operationally, for example, to make sure our plants are running all the time. The same thing with our human resource processes, financial processes, safety processes. Everything that we do, we should aim to, and we will be, the very best in the industry. And productivity, we obviously need to continue to focus on productivity to maintain our margins.","Second, in terms of deployment of capital, as you have heard me say before, we believe that we have at least $15 billion of capital to commit over the next five years. This includes cash and debt capacity available today and the investable cash flow we expect to generate in the next five years. I remain very confident \u2013 and I like to repeat this \u2013 I remain very confident that we will be able to commit the full $15 billion to very high-quality industrial gas projects over the next five years.","It is obviously to know exactly what will be the breakdown of the $15 billion, but based on our view today, I could see something approximately $1.5 billion for acquisitions of industrial gas companies; $2.5 billion for asset buybacks, $4 billion for traditional industrial gas projects such as new liquid oxygen and nitrogen plants, packaged gas depots, high purity nitrogen generators, and smaller-scale oxygen and nitrogen plants, and then about $7 billion for large-scale energy, environmental, and emerging market projects, including coal gasification. We continue to execute on our overall growth strategy, acquiring the Shell gasification technology and closing on the Lu'An project in the past quarter.","The third point is the evolution of our portfolio. Most of the types of the projects I mentioned before are in our onsite business. These are the very large projects around the world. To be clear, we do intend to continue investing in our merchant business when we see good opportunities to invest in liquid capacity around the world. And the same goes for packaged gas opportunities in locations where we are already in that business. However, given the relative size and number of onsite opportunities, I expect the onsite portion of our portfolio will grow faster, which means more of Air Products will be the onsite business in the future. This is good because the onsite business is very stable during the ups and downs of the economic cycle around the world.","Fourth, in terms of changing the culture, this remains a focus of our original Five-Point Plan that requires more work. We have to continue to improve our 4S culture, meaning safety, simplicity, speed, and self-confidence. We will work to further build a committed, diverse and motivated team that brings their positive attitudes and open minds to work every day.","And finally, on the last point on the chart on the right, at Air Products, we do have a higher purpose in addition to creating value for our shareholders. The higher purpose is to create an open and diverse environment for all of our people so that everyone feels that they belong and their contribution is recognized. In addition, all of us at Air Products are committed to make good products that benefit all humanity. And we certainly are committed to sustainability. In summary, at Air Products, we do want to do more than just making money. As I said, we are proud of what we have accomplished with our original Five-Point Plan and are confident that we will continue to deliver with our updated Five-Point Plan as delineated on this slide number 7.","Now please go to slide number 8, which shows the result of our three key metrics for the quarter. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three key metrics.","Now please go to slide number 9. Since I started as the Chairman, President, and CEO of Air Products more than four years ago, I have stressed the fact that we are committed to deliver at least 10% per year growth on our EPS over the long term. You can see that we have delivered better than that in the last four years. And we will continue to pursue strategies which will drive our EPS by at least 10% over the coming years. We are very committed to that.","Finally, please turn to slide number 10, which is always my favorite slide, especially this quarter. It is great to see our record margin of 36.3% and the progress we have made over the last few years.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, Seifi. Before I review our results, I want to provide an update on our external independent auditors. Air Products has had a long and productive audit relationship with KPMG since 2002. Given their tenure of 16 years as our auditors, the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board felt it was a good governance practice to initiate a competitive process earlier this year. I am pleased to share that after a full and rigorous evaluation, Deloitte & Touche will be Air Products' external auditor beginning with our fiscal year 2019. KPMG will continue as our auditor through the completion of our fiscal 2018 audit. I would like to emphasize that this decision was not the result of any disagreement with KPMG and that there are no issues with Air Products' financial statements or controls. I would like to thank the KPMG team members we have worked with over the years, and I look forward to working with the Deloitte team.","Now, please turn to slide 11 for our Q3 results from continuing operations. Sales of $2.3 billion increased 6% versus last year on 3% higher volumes, 1% higher price, and 3% higher currency. We saw solid volume increases across all three regions, partially offset by lower activity from the Jazan project in Global Gases. Excluding Jazan, volumes were up 7% with about 5% from new plants. Sequential volumes were up on strength in Americas and seasonality in Asia. Versus last year, pricing was up 1%, primarily driven by the China and Europe merchant businesses. Positive currency was driven by the euro, British pound and the Chinese RMB.","EBITDA of $820 million improved by 13%, driven by the higher volumes, positive pricing, currency and equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin of 36.3% was up 220 basis points. Net income was up 19% and adjusted earnings per share were up 18% versus prior year. ROCE of 12.2% was flat versus last year as our significant profit increase offset the larger denominator which increased as a result of the gain from the PMD sale in early 2017. The denominator is based on the five-quarter average. Q3 FY 2018 has five quarters that include the PMD gain, while Q3 of FY 2017 only had two quarters with the PMD gain. You can see the real improvement more clearly in the sequential 40-basis-point increase.","Please turn to slide 12. Our record adjusted Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.95 increased $0.30 or 18% versus last year. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.18 per share. Price and raw materials taken together increased EPS by $0.04. Net cost performance was unfavorable at 0.08 as productivity was again offset by a few factors including planned maintenance costs, inflation, and the end of the cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 capture project. We also continued to see higher costs in strategic areas focused on pursuing our exciting growth opportunities. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.05 favorable primarily due to the euro, British pound, and the Chinese RMB. Equity affiliate income added $0.05 primarily due to underlying strength in Mexico and Italy.","The overall tax rate was a $0.12 benefit versus last year. The lower tax rate from the new Tax Act increased EPS by about $0.10, which is more than previous quarters due to higher profit contributions from our U.S. business. For the full-year 2018, we now expect to see a tax rate slightly above 19%. Non-controlling interest was a $0.04 headwind. This is primarily due to a gain shared with our partner, which resulted from a customer terminating a contract for an old flue-gas desulphurization plant, which is a consolidated JV for Air Products. Interest expense, shares outstanding, and other non-operating income totaled $0.02 unfavorable.","Now please turn to slide 13. We had another strong cash flow quarter, with over $500 million of distributable cash flow and almost $300 million of investable cash flow. On a last 12 months basis, you can see we generated over $3 billion of EBITDA and over $2 billion of distributable cash flow. From the $2.2 billion of distributable cash flow, we paid $864 million or almost 40% as dividends. This leaves over $1.3 billion available for high return investments in our core industrial gas business.","Turning to slide 14, I would like to update you on the capital deployment capacity available for these exciting opportunities that Seifi mentioned. As of June 30, we have about $3 billion of cash in short-term investments. Our debt balance as of June 30 is about $3.9 billion. As we have shared many times, we have an active dialogue with the rating agencies and are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A\/A2 rating.","If we move (19:10) our debt level to about 2.5 times EBITDA, this would allow us to borrow an additional $4 billion. So, in total, we have about $7 billion we can deploy today, while maintaining our A\/A2 rating at a debt level of 2.5 times. This capacity increases to about $8.5 billion at a debt level of three times EBITDA. In addition, we have been and expect to continue to generate over $1 billion per year of investable cash that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx and dividends. So, over the next five years, we expect to have $15 billion available to invest, which does not include extra capacity from the cash flows from new profitable projects.","Now, to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Now, please turn to slide number 15, our Gases Americas, where we continue to deliver strong sales and profit growth. Sales increased 16% versus last year, driven by higher volumes, positive pricing and favorable currency impact. Volumes were up 6% excluding the impact of the one-time equipment sale last year \u2013 volumes were actually up 16% if you exclude the equipment sale, as I said. New projects were responsible for about three-quarters of this 16% increase, while gases business and acquisitions, they're roughly equal to the rest of the business.","I believe at the beginning, I said Gases Americas. I meant Gases Asia, so there's no confusion. I'm talking about our business in Asia. I wish our Americas business revolved around (21:14) 16%. That is not the case. Okay.","Pricing for the region was up 4% versus last year, the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement, which was primarily driven by better supply-and-demand situation in China's merchant market. Strong volumes, higher pricing and favorable currency more than offset the prior-year equipment sale headwind and drove the nearly 30% increase in EBITDA. EBITDA margin was strong and up 400 basis points. Sequentially, both volume and price increased as China emerged from the Lunar New Year holiday.","As mentioned in our last call, we closed the Lu'An project during quarter three. The team is making great progress as we bring the four gasifier trains on stream in stages. As we shared in April, we still expect about $0.04 earnings per share contribution in fiscal year 2018 and we expect the plant to be at full-run capacity by the end of September and therefore expect at least $0.25 per share of accretion in 2019 from the Lu'An project.","Now, I would like to turn this call back to Scott to discuss our Americas result, please.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to slide 16 for a review of our Gases Americas results. For the quarter, sales grew 2% with 6% higher volumes, partially offset by lower energy cost pass-through. Hydrogen demand remained strong and our new plant in Baytown, Texas supported increased sales. Underlying merchant volumes were positive, partially offset by a wholesale contract we terminated in Q4 of FY 2017. Excluding this, our overall volumes would have been up 8%. The overall pricing impact was flat as higher North American prices were offset by negative mix. This negative mix, for example, includes higher U.S. government helium sales that are lower than average prices. EBITDA was up 4% compared to prior year, driven by higher volumes partially offset by higher costs.","As we communicated last quarter, we had higher planned maintenance costs as we performed life extension work on several older hydrogen plants to support contract renewals. Our team executed a significant amount of work safely and effectively. And as I mentioned earlier, we no longer have the cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 capture project. However, as expected, partially offsetting these higher maintenance costs was a gain associated with a customer terminating a contract for an old flue-gas desulfurization plant. We also saw improved equity affiliate income with strong results in Mexico. EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points due to the positive margin impact of the lower energy cost pass-through. As we move into Q4, we expect maintenance costs to be lower sequentially but higher than prior year since maintenance activities were significantly lower than average in Q4 last year.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss other segments. Simon?","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to slide 17 for a review of our Gases EMEA results. Sales increased 24% primarily driven by a strong 12% volume increase. Price improved 3%, while energy pass-through and currency were up 2% and 7% respectively. Demand for hydrogen in the EMEA region was also strong. Our new hydrogen plant in India, onstream during a portion of Q3 last year, drove about 10% of our volume growth, and our Rotterdam franchise also contributed. As a reminder, the India plant was fully onstream in Q4 last year, so we don't expect a year-over-year benefit in Q4 of FY 2018.","Base merchant volume improved 2% supported by liquid bulk and packaged gases growth and a few small acquisitions. The robust activity in the merchant market also translated into higher pricing. The 3% uplift in price was predominantly due to a pricing action success in packaged gases. This represents our best pricing performance in many years. EBITDA was up 19% compared to prior year, primarily from the new plant in India and further supported by higher merchant volume, positive price, and favorable currency. EBITDA margin of 33% was down 160 basis points. However, excluding the new plant in India, which has comparatively high natural gas costs and other energy pass-through, EBITDA margin was actually up over 100 basis points.","Now, please turn to slide 18 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales and profits were down as we get closer to the end of the Jazan sale of equipment project. We continue to expect this to result in lower revenue in FY 2018, while we now also expect profits to be down slightly for the year. We continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and, as we have said, expect onstream in phases early in fiscal 2019.","Now, please turn to slide 19 for a brief comment on our Corporate segment, which includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our corporate costs. Although LNG project activity remains weak, sales increased slightly compared to prior year, but overall segment profits were flat. We continue to see signs of renewed interest in future LNG projects, but do not expect this to translate to an earnings tailwind in the near future.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Simon. Our team around the world is very excited about Air Products' future. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation of our continued growth. And the evolution of our Five-Point Plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward. As I said before, we have the financial capacity, the opportunities and the team to successfully win key growth projects. Let me just address the current state of global trade relations and tariffs. Very simply, we have not \u2013 I'd like to stress \u2013 we have not seen any impact on Air Products at this point.","Our business is local, so we don't have any direct exposure to import-export tariffs. We have not seen consumers changing their behavior. And as I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to close the Lu'An joint venture in China earlier this quarter as we expected. There is no doubt that there is uncertainty in the world. And while we cannot predict or control worldwide political or economic developments, we do have control over the operational performance and growth of Air Products, and we are confident we will continue to deliver on the commitments that we have made.","Now, please turn to slide number 20. We are working hard every day to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. That continues to be our goal. Continuing our positive momentum, we have again increased our guidance for the year to a range of $7.40 to $7.45. At midpoint, this is up $0.10 from the guidance we gave you last quarter. Our new guidance represents 17% to 18% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2017 performance. As I said, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment to grow our EPS by at least 10% each year for the future. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, our earnings per share guidance is $1.95 to $2, up 11% to 14% over last year. We continue to expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion in fiscal year 2018.","Now, please turn to slide 21. I've talked about this many times. I don't need to repeat that. And please turn now to slide number 23 (sic) [22] (31:25). You can see that we believe very strongly that our real competitive advantage is the degree of commitment and motivation of the great team that we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate superior safety and operational performance. I do want to thank all of our 15,000 employees around the world for their total commitment and hard work, and I'm very proud to be part of this winning team.","Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question today from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I was curious of the strength in affiliates. You mentioned that was a big part of the U.S. or the Americas business and I know its overall up nearly 40%. Can you give us some color on what's going on there? And then, maybe also, Seifi, when you were giving your capital allocation potential buckets, acquisition of gas assets, is the affiliates considered in that bucket? Thanks.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Bob, good morning. Thanks for your question. I'll answer your question number two first and make a comment on question number one and then turn it over to Scott to elaborate. On question number two, when we talk about the $15 billion of investment capacity, that does not include any acquisition or anything by our affiliates. That's just Air Products. Then, with respect to your question number one, we have always said that we see a strong economic activity in India, and that has obviously contributed to affiliates. And we had some obvious growth in Italy and Mexico, which are our big equity affiliates. But, Scott, would you like to expand on that, please?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. I'd just emphasize what you already said. It's broad-based, Bob. It's good fundamental business performance in Mexico, in Italy, in India, and actually some of our smaller ones in Asia as well. So, real good performance across the board this quarter from our equity affiliates.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Next is Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Your volumes in the Americas were up 6%, and your volumes in Americas have been pretty good through the first three quarters of the year. That is all of the numbers have been comparable. But your operating income has been pretty flat. I was wondering what's behind that in that your results versus your competitors seem to be \u2013 to show much slower growth in EBIT. And maybe to rephrase Bob's question, your equity affiliates income was $24 million in the Americas versus $14 million in the year ago. Is the $24 million number a new run rate or is there something unusual about that $24 million level?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay. Well, there is nothing unusual about the run rate, first of all, Jeff, so we expect our equity affiliates to do well. With respect to the Americas, we have an issue in terms of mix. That means that our volumes are up because we were selling more to customers who have a lower price basically. That is the fundamental reason why you don't (35:32) we are not particularly excited about that, but that is the explanation. Overall, Jeff, you know the business very well. Fundamentally, our prices is going to be the same as other people's prices. We are not going to fall behind on that, because if our prices are lower, we will get significantly higher volumes. But I'd just like to turn it over to Scott to expand on what I said.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thanks, Seifi. I just want to build \u2013 I think I made some comments in the prepared remarks. In Americas, just recall we have a very nice leadership position in hydrogen and we saw some maintenance planned turns. The team did a great job of executing those. But that's driving costs up year-on-year. So that's also a reason why you don't see the operating income growth consistent with the top line. Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay, Jeff?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Seifi, question on your capital allocation buckets. I notice that share repurchase continues to not be on that list. I'm just wondering, especially post Air Products not participating in any of the Praxair, Linde sales in Europe or the Americas, whether you've re-thought your approach to share repurchase.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","No, we have not. Because I mean, share repurchase obviously \u2013 what does it do for you? It artificially improves your EPS. We are taking the position that of the cash that we generate, we are giving half of that in dividend to the investors. So, it's not as if we are holding all the cash. So, half of that is going to a very generous dividend policy that we are saying we give 2.5% of stock price as dividend. The other half, we believe very strongly that we have opportunities to invest that capital on projects that we will create significantly more value for the shareholders than buying the shares back, so that is our position. That hasn't changed. And we do not see any change in the outlook for the deployment of the capital, so therefore that's where we are.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then a follow-up, you noted that you had record EBITDA margins in the quarter. Are you now at an inflection point given the strong base business volume growth that the incremental loadings are generating very strong incremental margin? So, should we look for a continuation of this strong EBITDA margin performance?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, obviously, we are very pleased with the EBITDA margin for the quarter. But for the long term, we have always told the investors to, please, when you make models for Air Products that our EBITDA range is going to be somewhere between 33% to 36%. It's not going to go down and it will be within that range. Now, some quarters like this quarter, we had 36.3%. I hope it repeats every quarter, but I don't want to give the impression that our margins are now suddenly going to be several basis points higher than what our run rate has been for the last two quarters. And obviously, now our EBITDA margins are almost 300% better than the next people. Okay?","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Morning, David.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Seifi, on Americas pricing you said, so again, positive in the quarter, any acceleration versus prior quarters? You've announced a lot of price increases. And is that positive North American pricing up around 2% or more or less?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","It's about 2%. But the thing is that usually, we don't like to make too many comments about pricing. But we obviously fully understand that higher prices means higher profit. That's what our organization is focused on that. But we need to have a balance between what we can charge and what the supply-demand situation is. But our utilization rate in the U.S., please consider that it is still in the \u2013 around 77%, 78%. Now, in places that our utilization rate is above 80% like in China, we are getting significant price increases as you see.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And Seifi, on the $15 billion of capital deployment, thank you for the breakdown. If you did it by geography or by country, how would that break down roughly speaking in your best estimate?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I mean, it's very difficult to kind of pinpoint that. But order of magnitude, obviously we would like to invest as much as we can in the U.S. But right now from what we see order of magnitude, probably about $2.5 billion will be in the Americas, about maybe $2.5 billion to $3 billion in Europe including Russia and then, the balance of it in Asia-Pacific because anything that we invest in India is really equity affiliate. It's not part of the numbers that I've given you.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","And we'll now go to Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, fellas.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","First question is just on the India plant and its impact on the margins in EMEA. It sounded like you were negative 160 basis points year-over-year, but you said you would be up 100 bps without that. 260 bps of delta seems like a lot of influence from one plant. Can you just walk through the economics and why that's such a big hit to that region?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, since Simon was talking about Europe, I'll have him answer that. Go ahead, Simon.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Duffy, so two things to remember. First of all, this is a great project, very, very good returns on this project. But the natural gas prices are extremely high in India. I think they're in the range of $12 per million BTUs. So, you have a very large hydrogen plant, very high natural gas prices, so that has a pretty significant dilutive effect on the margins. And I think you've seen that over the last few quarters. We also, by the way, had some additional energy pass-through in Europe. And just one final point is, in Q4, we'll lap this, so you won't see a year-over-year delta next quarter.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, just to go back to the buckets on the capital allocation, in the $7 billion that you called out as being large energy projects, how much of that would actually be coal gasification in China versus all other?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Duffy, I give more details and, obviously, the investors want even more details. We thought we have gone a long way by actually breaking down that, but out of the $7 billion, I expect approximately $5 billion will be in China.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to PJ Juvekar with Citi.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning. How are you, PJ?","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. So, what are margin utilization rates in Europe and Asia where you are seeing positive pricing? And how does that compare to Americas where pricing is still flat? I know you mentioned in the response to earlier question that in America you're selling with lower price \u2013 not lower price but lower-price customers. But can you just compare the utilization rates?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure. Our utilization rate in the Americas is around 77% to 78%. Utilization in Europe is around 80%. In China, the industry utilization is around 55% to 60%. But Air Products' utilization rate, because we haven't built a lot of merchant plants, our utilization rate in China right now is at around 82% to 84%. So, that is where we are, and you can obviously correlate pricing to the utilization rate. I mean, it's obvious if you're selling a commodity LOX\/LIN, and that is totally subject to supply-demand.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for that. And you acquired Shell's coal gasification technology. Has that improved your competitiveness in bidding for coal gasification projects, and are there any projects outside of China that you are looking at?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","PJ, I cannot \u2013 now that the deal is closed, this has been a fantastic deal for us and it has created significant opportunities and we are seeing a lot of things that we didn't see before. So, I'm very happy with that acquisition. In addition to that, that has opened up significant opportunities outside of China. Yes, we are very pleased with the acquisition. It was the right thing to do. We have gotten a lot of very capable and very talented people. And that has given us \u2013 I think at the end, it will give us a significant competitive edge.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Any particular regions outside of China?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Outside of China, it will be \u2013 it is places like Indonesia, Australia, Middle East, Europe, it's all over the place, and the United States. But please when I'm talking about Shell, I need to clarify. We bought two technologies from Shell. One is for coal gasification and the other one is for liquid gasification. The liquid gasification is also important because, PJ, as you know very well, a lot of the refineries need to upgrade their bottom of the barrel because of the IMO 2020.","One of the ways to solve the problem of dealing with high-sulfur residue is rather than coking it, is to use that liquid and gasify it. That is what Saudi Arabia is doing with the Jazan Project, so that I think will open up opportunities for us because we own the Shell technology for liquid gasification.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for that explanation. Thanks.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","We'll go to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. So, clearly, hydrogen appears to be the key driver of the positive momentum in volumes. Can you just hit on some other key end markets as well? Is anything surprising to the upside or downside versus your initial excitations at the beginning of the year? And then just also any long-term comments on your outlook for, you hit on this a little, on energy and then also environment? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, thank you very much, Chris. In terms of the day-to-day things, obviously we are seeing economic development in the U.S., which is helping with the utilization rates a little bit, although it's not as robust as we hoped. But in China, the growth has not slowed down and we are growing very well there. In India, we don't consolidate, but the growth rates are very good. And quite frankly, as I think I've mentioned to you before in one-on-one, Europe has been a surprise on the positive side because quite frankly we thought that with the Brexit and all of that, that European economy will suffer. It has not. So as a result, it's not growing very fast, but it is tightening, and you can see that the pricing is improving there. So, those are overall the positive things.","Then with respect to the very big projects, yes, we are very optimistic about that. There is significant activity with respect to big projects in China, and in Middle East, in Russia, in the U.S. So, we see a lot of so-called mega projects.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And you've also been successful in establishing a portfolio which lends itself to the onsite utility type model. Can you just remind us of your longer-term goals in terms of projected earnings stability, just with any details or consideration for both the composition of your backlog and projected capital deployment? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure, Chris. Obviously, if you go on my wish-list, I hope that five years from now 75% of our business is onsite. And I think that will probably happen with the way that we are deploying the capital. Our base business, merchant business and packaged gases business will continue to grow. We are not going more onsite at the expense of that business, but that business which is our liquid business and our packaged gases business, is going to grow with global GDP, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5% a year. But our ambitions are significantly higher than that. We want to grow the company by more than 10% as we have done in the past four years. That means that by default, although our base business is continuing to grow, our onsite businesses will grow faster. Therefore, when you put it all together, hopefully by 2023 75% of Air Products business will be onsite, which will be very stable and very profitable in terms of not only margins, but also in terms of return on capital employed.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you for your thoughts as always. Appreciate it.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Seifi, perhaps Simon pulled a fast one on you and changed the order of the slides and moved the Asia segment to be discussed first instead of last, but I suspect from your commentary about capital allocation by region that was intentional. Would you say in this five-year plan that could become your largest segment?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, first of all, I'd like to make a comment. I've just landed from a 14-hour overnight flight. And I just came to the office. So, I think you need to give me a little bit of a break for not mixing up Gases Americas and Gases Asia. But Simon had the slides in the right order but I just \u2013 when I was looking at it, I just said Gases Americas rather than Gases Asia. But right now when you look at our Americas business, I think we disclosed that. That's about a $4 billion business.","Our Asia business is right now running at around $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion. With the capital deployment programs that we have, our Americas section will grow. But I think in five years, I don't expect Asia to be double in size, but it might, it might become our biggest region by 2023, 2024. And right now, we are \u2013 I mean if it grows with the kind of EBITDA margin that we have, which is 43%, that would be very good.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And trust me, Seifi, that was just all in fun. But with respect to Asia and your outlook for coal gasification, obviously it's a strong market opportunity in terms of demand and you have technology. But would you also say that you \u2013 in the competitive bidding process, it's maybe a little less intense, particularly on bids that include the gasifier in addition to the air separation units?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","That is not the case. We just lost the big coal gasification project to one of our competitors. I obviously don't want to mention who it is. But if people are telling you they are not pursuing coal gasification in China, you should ask them again. Everybody is there. Everybody is eager to win a project. And as I said, last month, we lost a coal gasification project in China, in southern China, to one of our competitors who claims they are not that excited about China. So, everybody is there, my friend. When people look at these projects and the size and the profitability, they are not going to give us a break, they are following us where we are going.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. First, the question about pricing in Europe and then maybe a follow-up on the environmental CapEx allocation that you've got. In Europe, that record 3% price increase, I can't imagine that CO2 kind of contributed to that and I would think Praxair and Linde are not being that aggressive on price given they're in front of regulators. So, what's allowing you right now to achieve that kind of price versus in past periods?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I would say good execution but, again, since Simon made comments about Europe, Simon, would you like to answer that?","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So, John, obviously we can't speak to what the competition is doing. The team is working hard on pricing in the Europe region and we did emphasize that we saw a lot of the strength in packaged gas here this past quarter. So, quite frankly, good job by the team.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","And from CO2 it was very little. Not significant.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","On the $7 billion that you're going to put into energy environmental, obviously, environmental in the past with Tees Valley and some of the earlier projects, you're probably not headed down that path again, but what are you thinking about there when you say environmental?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","What we are talking about is projects that would help with solving environmental issues. The biggest thing that we are referring to is, number one, this IMO20 where people have to do something with the bottom of the barrel and the second thing that we are talking about is coal gasification which is a much more environmentally friendly of using the coal rather than burning it in a power plant to generate power.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, you're including coal gasification when you say environmental.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the backlog, it seems like it's been kind of static here for, I guess, the last quarter or two. And I know you have a number of opportunities that you highlighted. I guess, at least in terms of where you think the capital is going to get deployed, I guess how are you thinking about the timing of when we may start hearing about some of these and getting the contracts to kind of the finish line? And I think you mentioned it in the beginning that you didn't see the tariff issues necessarily having any impact. And so, I guess, what's holding up some of the announcement on this or is it just simply a timing issue?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, John, you are putting me in a position that \u2013 especially my lawyer is sitting here and saying, don't make too many forward-looking statements here. But we are working, obviously, on a lot of projects. But quite frankly, John, this is a formal call. This is not a casual conversation. I'm the chairman of the company, and I'm saying that we feel very confident about deploying the capital. So, I can only say that if I see a backlog of projects that we are working on.","Now, when are they going to come to fruition and when are we going to be able to announce them? I mean, I obviously can't predict that, but we definitely have a robust number of projects that we are definitely working on. No question.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Fair enough. Thanks very much for the color.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, John.","Operator","And we'll go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. And Seifi, I hope you get some good sleep tonight. You're probably pretty tired.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just looking at slide 24, the project slide, and I know you guys are out of the \u2013 telling us what the EPS contribution is from new projects. But you've got a bunch of stuff that's scheduled to come online in fiscal 2019. So, as we think about our models, if you can give us any update or any color sort of on first half, second half, second quarter, fourth quarter, just sort of any sense or dimension around the start-ups there.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, on that one, Andrew (sic) [Vincent] (57:33), one thing that we have said and we stand behind that is that we want to grow EPS at least 10%. So, you should expect that our guidance for 2019 will be 10% higher than 2018, I mean, unless the world falls apart. But other than that, in terms of the specifics, I think we are very specific in terms of the timing of these things. But to break it down by quarter, well, these are plants, new plants start up. The customer has to be ready and all of that. So, I would be a little bit hesitant to start pinpointing it by quarter. But overall, as I said, on overall basis, obviously we need the contribution of these projects in order to deliver the 10%.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","And, Simon, you'd like to...","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Just obviously, Vincent, Seifi again reminded us that we have made a specific comment around the Lu'An project and we'd expect that to deliver at least $0.25 next year. So, yeah.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, there was something written during the quarter about a CO2 shortage in Europe. Doesn't seem like it was an issue within your results, but any comments there vis-\u00e0-vis your results?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, the reason is that we are not very big in CO2 in Europe. So, the whole event didn't have too much of an impact on us at all.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And next is Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. This is Matt on for Kevin.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes. Hi, Matt.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. If we were to rewind to this time last year, the company was discussing the possibility of participating in remedy asset divestitures from Praxair-Linde, about like $1 billion in revenue. Since then, Messer and Nippon Sanso seemed to have secured the divested assets. But can you kind of walk through what were the primary reasons for why you ended up taking a pass on the businesses given just the capital deployment targets the company has?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We didn't take a pass. The regulators decided to give us a pass. We would have \u2013 we've always said we were interested in that. But the regulators decided that we should go do other things.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then I might have missed this, I was jumping around a little bit. But Gases \u2013 Global kind of showed a nice sequential uptick in EBIT despite the ongoing headwinds from the lower Jazan sales. What was behind the improvement there?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Simon?","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. And again, I would just point out that the technical term for Jazan is lumpy, so it just moves around a little bit especially sequentially.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right.

Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning.

Hi, Jim. How are you?","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","So, year-to-date, we're at about $0.20 earnings per share versus prior year through three quarters. And our view, as always, is we just assume things kind of move sideways from where they are as we're closing the quarter. And so, if we look at that, we think it's going to be flat, maybe a modest headwind in our fourth quarter versus the prior year given where the currencies are now.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. And could you comment on which end markets you're seeing the most strength in besides refining?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Around the \u2013 we don't usually comment by markets, but overall, in the U.S. it's really most of the sectors, whether it is food, whether it is steel, whether it is \u2013 all of the other things. In China, it is obviously consumer demand for the products that we have around the world. So, it's a mix, it's not any very particular market that suddenly has started contributing to our bottom line. As you know, we have more than 60,000 customers around the world. So, we do not see any suddenly one sector growing 10%. It's just across the board and that's the good thing about our company because we have exposure to all of these businesses.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","A very quick one and given the end of the call is, can you characterize how your cash tax rate will evolve as your mix shifts around the world or as the types of project shift? But that seems to be affecting the conversion of EBITDA growth into distributable cash flow.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, that's a very good question. And since it's a difficult question, I'll give it to you, Scott, to answer.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Back to your comment around forward-looking statements, right, Seifi? So, if I just (01:02:46) again for this year in terms of a book for the fourth quarter, we're thinking about 20%, so we'll come in for the year in total a little bit above 19%. And then as we go forward from a cash tax perspective, obviously, we're focused on making more money in all parts of the world. About $400 million or so cash taxes for this year and early indications, you can assume roughly about the same for next year. Again, it depends on the amount, so that depends on the locations. I think in terms of a percent of cash taxes as a percent of pre-tax earnings, kind of the high-teens is what we would say going forward, a reasonable assumption at this point, okay?","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J.

I hope Europe stays where it is, which means that although it's not growing very fast, it's not going down. And the U.S., obviously, it depends on the effect of the tax cut and all of that.

Please review the information on these slides, and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to John.","John E. McGlade","Thanks, Simon, and good morning. Before we take you through the details of the quarter, I would like to make a few comments. While we did see signs of improvement, the quarter generally continued the pattern of weak economic growth and a soft electronics market. Despite this, our earnings did come in above the midpoint of our range. Our underlying volumes were flat versus prior year, excluding the impact of our decision to exit the Polyurethane Intermediates business. As we said last quarter, we expect this slow growth environment to continue for some time. Most importantly, we continue to stay focused on actions within our control. Last year's European restructuring is complete and delivering the full $60 million per year run rate benefit we expected.","The integration of our Indura acquisition is proceeding as planned. And while early, the initial results of our EPCO acquisition announced last quarter are encouraging. Through the quarter, we remain focused on execution and continue to drive improvement through cost discipline and productivity.","Further, we are confident our $3 billion project backlog, which is over 80% on-site\/pipeline business with long-term take-or-pay contract terms, will drive earnings growth into the future.","In our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials businesses, we are taking proactive steps to continue to improve the performance of the business today, and we see significant opportunity when the economy improves to load our existing assets at high incremental margins.","As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we are actively assessing additional actions we can take that would result in improved margins and returns, and increase value to our shareholders. That process is ongoing, and we are making good progress.","As a result of these new actions, we expect to take a charge of approximately $100 million to $150 million pretax, or $0.30 to $0.50 per share in our fiscal Q4, with savings beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year '14. Once fully implemented, we expect the savings to be of the same order of magnitude as the $60 million per year benefit we achieved through the actions announced in 2012. Our plan is focused on improving our cost position in those regions and businesses that are facing the greatest challenges from slower market growth. We will have more specifics to share with you about this on or before next quarter's earnings call. I want to be clear that these cost actions do not mean our assessment is completed. We are continuing to actively review additional opportunities available to us to further improve our operations and increase shareholder value, and we'll keep you updated on our progress.","Finally, our cash priorities remain unchanged: invest in our businesses at returns that create increasing shareholder value; increase our dividend each year, which we've now done for 31 consecutive years; strive to maintain an A bond rating; and repurchase shares.","Now let me turn the call over to Scott to review our results.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 3. As we look back at this past quarter, manufacturing growth was weaker than expected when we developed our prior guidance. As a result, while we did see a pickup in our volumes versus the previous quarter, the improvement was modest relative to the seasonal uptick we typically see in this quarter.","Let me provide you a few comments around what we are seeing. In North America, we continue to experience modest growth as the economy decelerates due to the impacts of higher taxes from the fiscal cliff and sequestration spending cuts. In Europe, the economy is worse than we expected and continues to contract versus last year despite some weak sequential growth during the quarter. In Asia, China continues to grow below trend line as the new government policy is focused on reforms in addition to growth. And the slower growth in China and the developed markets is impacting other emerging economies in Asia and South America.","The electronics industry has remained soft with new fab construction delays, and the outlook for silicon processing remains below last year. Non-residential construction did not pick up during the quarter as we had expected, and this has impacted our Performance Materials volumes.","As I mentioned last quarter, the LOX\/LIN pricing environment in Merchant has become more difficult due to softer volumes, particularly in Europe and Asia, thereby impacting our ability to completely recover variable cost increases.","While pricing was stable in North America, we were not able to fully recover power cost increases. Despite these challenges, and as John mentioned, we did deliver EPS above the midpoint of the guidance we provided in April.","Let me now take you through our overall results. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were 9% higher versus prior year, with acquisitions contributing 6% and energy and raw material pass-through adding 5%. On an underlying basis, sales were down 2% due to our previously announced decision to exit the Polyurethane Intermediates or PUI business. Excluding PUI, higher volumes in our Merchant Gases and Equipment businesses were offset by lower volumes in our Electronics business. Sequentially, overall sales increased 3%, primarily due to seasonally stronger volumes in our Merchant and Performance Materials businesses. Simon will provide additional segment and geographic detail shortly.","Operating income of $383 million decreased 3% versus prior year and 2% sequentially. Our operating margin of 15% was down 200 basis points versus prior year due to higher pension costs, higher energy pass-through and the underrecovery of increased variable costs, primarily in the Merchant business. Each of these had about a 50-basis-point impact on margin. And consistent with past quarters, the Indura acquisition has about a 20-basis-point dilutive impact.","Sequentially, our margin declined 70 basis point, primarily due to pension settlements and higher merchant costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share were down 5% and 4%, respectively, versus last year. Our return on capital employed of 10.5% was lower due to an increase in our capital in part due to the Indura acquisition.","Turning to Slide 4. You can see an overview of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.36 decreased by $0.05 or 4% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.10, including $0.06 from Indura.","Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.05, due primarily to higher power costs in our Merchant business. Net cost performance was $0.06 unfavorable, including a $0.05 unfavorable pension impact.","Our productivity about offset inflation and higher planned maintenance. Excluded from the volume and cost lines is the net $0.04 unfavorable impact from our decision to exit the PUI business. We saw no impact from currency translation and foreign-exchange year-on-year. Equity affiliate income contributed $0.01, and noncontrolling interest was $0.01 greater due to the addition of Indura. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to increased debt. Our tax rate was 24%, slightly lower than last year and contributed $0.01. And lastly, lower shares outstanding as a result of our $460 million share repurchase in Q1 contributed $0.02.","Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases' sales of just over $1 billion were up 18% over last year, driven by stronger volumes and the Indura acquisition. Underlying sales were up 2% on 2% higher volumes and flat pricing.","Liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes were up in all regions, partially offset by lower helium volumes due to supply challenges and packaged gases demand weakness in Europe. Sales were up 3% sequentially on 4% stronger volumes, flat pricing and a negative 1% impact from currency. Volumes were notably stronger in Asia, rebounding from the Lunar New Year slowdown in the prior quarter.","Helium volume was below our expectations and was down versus prior year, driven by limited availability from our helium feedstock suppliers, particularly in the U.S. We expect helium to remain relatively tight over the next few years until some of the longer-term sources we are developing come on stream. We do expect a slight improvement in Q4 and more into FY '14 as we get product from our Wyoming facility and additional Middle Eastern supply helps the industry. We are also actively developing additional new sources and expect to make a specific announcement soon.","Merchant Gases' operating income of $165 million was flat versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16% was down 280 basis points compared to last year and down 80 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on profit from the Indura acquisition and the higher volumes but was offset by higher pension costs and higher power costs that were not fully recovered with price increases.","Sequentially, operating income was down on higher power, maintenance and other operating costs. Overall, the Indura business continues to operate well. We have delivered on the expected synergies with good cost performance, saw improved margins this quarter and are seeing growth opportunities in a variety of end markets. We announced the new plant and the expansion of a second plant earlier this quarter.","As we expected and said in the past, given Indura's business mix, their margins are in the low double-digits. As a result, for the quarter, Indura negatively impacted segment margins by about 50 basis points. Margins were also negatively impacted by increased pension costs and higher power costs that were not recovered in the marketplace as pricing was flat overall.","Let's review the Merchant business by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In U.S.\/Canada, sales were up 6% on 2% higher volumes and 4% higher pricing. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes were up 5% on strength in the oilfield services, metals processing and petrochemical markets. The strong LOX\/LIN volume performance reflects the benefit of our recent robust contract signings coming onstream. Liquid argon volumes were also up, but helium volumes were down due to supply limitations. We had our best quarter so far this year for new contract signings, and lost business was below last year. LOX\/LIN capacity utilization is in the low to mid-70s.","Although, overall pricing was positive, this was primarily due to helium and the contractual recovery of higher natural gas prices in liquid hydrogen. LOX\/LIN prices were down slightly, and given the increase in power costs, this had a negative effect on margin.","We announced earlier this quarter the acquisition of EPCO, the largest independent liquid CO2 company in the U.S. Liquid CO2 is a great complement to the rest of our liquid bulk offerings and improves Air Products' supply to those customers who use multiple products in key markets such as food freezing, oilfield services, pharmaceutical and metal fabrication. The integration is going well.","In Europe, sales were down 2% versus last year on 2% lower volumes and 1% lower pricing, partially offset by a 1% increase from currency. LOX\/LIN volumes were slightly positive, helped by wholesale volumes, but underlying end-market demand remains weak, particularly in metals, glass and cement and food.","Helium volumes were down on supply limitations, while cylinder volumes were down throughout Europe, particularly in Central and Southern Europe and U.K.\/Ireland. Overall pricing was down 1%, with positive helium pricing partially offsetting negative LOX\/LIN pricing. The LOX\/LIN price decline was driven by both lower price and the mix effect from the increased wholesale volumes.","New contract signings were comparable to last year but down relative to the last few quarters, and LOX\/LIN plant routings remain in the mid-70s. We have fully completed the cost savings program announced last year and are seeing the savings in the P&L.","In Asia, sales were down 1% versus last year on flat volumes, 2% lower prices and a positive 1% currency impact. LOX\/LIN volumes were up across the region and up mid-single digits in China, both x conversions. Liquid argon volumes showed improvement after a few quarters of weakness, and helium was down on supply limitations.","Cylinder volume growth was moderated by customer profitability actions and conversions, and we continue to see good growth in our Microbulk product line. Pricing was down in the liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon business, particularly in China.","Power costs were up, negatively impacting margins. Plant loadings remain in the mid-70s. Capacity additions will continue to impact loadings despite volume growth as we bring on projects under construction. And new contract signings were stronger than last quarter, which have been the best in years.","Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases' sales of $846 million were up 10% versus last year on higher energy pass-through, partially offset by lower PUI volumes. Base volumes are relatively flat as U.S. Gulf Coast customer maintenance outages and 2 steel customer outages offset fewer customer outages in Europe. The exit of our PUI business by January 2014 is proceeding as we expected.","For the quarter, PUI sales were down about $50 million versus prior year, and operating income was down over $10 million. Our expectations for the full year haven't changed. We expect PUI sales to be down about $160 million and operating income to be down about $25 million.","For the segment, sequential sales were up 5% on slightly higher volumes x PUI and higher energy pass-through. Operating income of $120 million was down 11% versus prior year. X PUI, operating income of $118 million was down 2% on higher planned outage maintenance costs.","Operating income was down 3% sequentially. X PUI, operating income was flat as lower bonus payment timing was offset by lower overhead costs. Operating margin of 14.2% was down 330 basis points versus prior year and down 100 basis points sequentially on the lower operating income and higher energy cost pass-through.","As we said last quarter, we continue to see strong project development activity in the global hydrogen business. Customers are making decisions, and we expect to have project announcements in the near future.","Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $566 million were down 6% versus last year, with volumes down 5% and pricing down 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 3% on 4% higher volumes, partially offset by a negative 1% currency impact.","Versus prior year, electronic sales were down 11% with significantly lower equipment sales and weaker processed materials, somewhat offset by new on-site projects. The lower equipment sales are due to the slowdown in new fab CapEx, but we do expect equipment sales to rebound next quarter.","Processed materials was impacted by lower fab utilization, PV market weakness and competitive activity affecting both volume and price. Sales were up 1% sequentially, a modest increase, below our expectations based on historical seasonal patterns, with improved materials volume somewhat offset by the negative currency impact.","Performance Materials' sales were down 1% versus last year as higher volumes were offset by lower prices. Autos and the U.S. housing market continue to be positive, while non-residential construction was weaker than we expected and marine coatings continue to be weak. Sequentially, PMD sales were up 5% on improvement across Asia, Europe and North America. However, this growth was below our expectations.","Operating income of $87 million was down 4% versus prior year on the lower electronics volumes and the combination of lower prices and product mix in PMD. Operating margin was up 30 basis points to 15.3% on mix, primarily in the electronics equipment business. Sequentially, operating income was up 12%, and operating margin was up 120 basis points, primarily due to the higher electronics materials and PMD volumes.","Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $104 million were up 9% versus prior year, primarily on higher LNG project activity and down 16% sequentially on lower LNG and ASU activity. Operating income of $16 million was up 63% over prior year on the higher LNG project activity and lower development spending. Operating income was down 22% versus prior quarter on the lower project activity.","The backlog of $327 million is down 25% from last year and unchanged versus last quarter as new orders were modest. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce our first major LNG order in the U.S. for Dominion's Cove Point, Maryland LNG export terminal, designed to produce over 5 million tons per year of LNG when operational in 2017. LNG development activity remains strong, and we expect to have additional announcements soon.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 10, and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook.","Given the weaker-than-expected conditions we saw in Q3, we remain cautious on our expectations for near-term economic growth. In the U.S., growth in manufacturing output is expected to come in at the low end of our range. Uncertainty in the economy remains and unresolved fiscal challenges and diminished global demand are likely to continue to impact the pace of the recovery.","In Europe, FY '13 will show negative year-over-year growth in manufacturing, below our expectations. We are hopeful that we are approaching the bottom and anticipate sequential growth going forward.","In Asia, we expect a gradual acceleration in manufacturing growth to continue, particularly in China. However, the recent government focus in China on reform is expected to temper growth going forward. And in South America, we expect the year to be at the low end of our original expectations.","Our backlog remains robust, about $3 billion including a few projects that have not yet been announced. We still see a number of opportunities in oxygen for coal gasification in China and in hydrogen projects around the world. CapEx is expected to be about $2 billion this year, consistent with our most recent guidance.","For Q4, our EPS guidance is $1.44 to $1.50, based on the following factors: on the positive side, we expect to see improved sequential volumes in Merchant; higher volumes and lower maintenance and tonnage following a number of customer outages this past quarter; less of an impact from the PUI business; and Equipment and Energy results should show some sequential improvement as well. A partial offset is expected from a higher share count. This results in our full year EPS guidance range being $5.47 to $5.53, within the range we shared with you last quarter despite the slower economy.","Now let me turn it back to John to wrap up.","John E. McGlade","Thanks, Scott. We delivered earnings results within our commitments for the quarter despite the more modest economic activity. This earnings performance is a result of us taking decisive actions to manage what is within our control, with a particular focus on reducing costs, driving productivity and disciplined project execution.","As I said earlier, we are actively assessing additional actions we can take that would result in improved margins and returns and increase value to our shareholders. The process is ongoing. We are making good progress and as a result, expect to take a charge in our fiscal Q4. Our plan is focused on improving our cost position in those regions and businesses that are facing the greatest challenges from slower market growth. We will have more specifics to share with you about this on or before next quarter's earnings call. And we continue to actively review additional opportunities available to us to further improve our operations and increase shareholder value.","I believe our focus on increasing shareholder value remains unwavering. We are executing well on our strong backlog of projects that will drive earnings and cash flow growth as they come online. We have significant leverage in our existing assets that leaves us well positioned for a recovery, and we remain focused on productivity, improving our core businesses and delivering on our cash priorities.","Thank you. And now we are happy to turn your questions -- turn to your questions. Jessica?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One, power costs continue to be an issue you guys talk about. And I'm just curious, is there anything that's changed about the time it takes you to get through power increases? And what regions did you see the greatest inflation in power?","Simon R. Moore","Yes, Bob, good question. So certainly, there, you are acknowledging that there is a lag delay in recovering the power costs, and I think we really saw the power cost impact. We saw it primarily in North America, certainly with the increase in natural gas costs and that significantly impacting power costs, where gas is on the margin for power producers. We also saw increased power costs in Asia. And I guess it's important to note that we did see these power costs increase. At the same time, while we wouldn't have been expecting to recover all of that in price this quarter, we are also seeing some pressure on the liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen pricing as well.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then would there be a similar benefit from the natural gas in your Tonnage business? I know when the business was struggling, that was certainly a factor in margin compression. So have you not seen any symmetric benefit as gas has gone back up here to the $3.70 range?","Simon R. Moore","No, Bob. We've seen it -- and consistent with the rough rules of thumb we shared, both in terms of the impact on sales and operating income, we have seen that in the Tonnage business.","Operator","We'll go next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to get on the LOX\/LIN pricing pressure, anything changed, fundamentals in the market in terms of increasing competitive intensity that's coming forth right now?","Simon R. Moore","So I think if we're talking about -- I made a comment on the LOX\/LIN pricing. Perhaps -- John, you want to comment on kind of the broader competitive dynamic, particularly on the big projects?","John E. McGlade","Certainly, on the larger projects that -- we still see very, very good bidding activity. We've been quite successful. We mentioned the fact that we've had about a $3 billion project backlog when you consider projects that are in execution and a few that we'll announce shortly. In my mind, in this business, it's always been about where you have your skills, your competitive differentiation. And to be clear, and I think I've said this many times, there's no strategic project when you're making a $100 million bet or more on a long-term take-or-pay contract. You really have to earn the return expectations that are accretive to the strategy of the business and the corporation or you don't take it.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, on China, given the slowing growth in that region, have you seen any slowing of bidding activity in that region on new projects?","John E. McGlade","Yes, David, a couple of points. Really, China is really a tale about 2 stories right now in the context of the slowing Merchant business, although, as Simon noted, it's starting to improve a little, is really a function of decisions made in China to slow down the sort of manufacturing-driven economy in favor of urbanization, in favor of consumer opportunities, et cetera. The projects that we're pursuing -- and the answer specifically to your question is we have not seen a slowdown once the new government had gotten in place. For a couple of quarters there, as the government transition was happening, projects weren't getting approved at the national or the provincial level until they understood where the new government is. But frankly, the policies of the new government, whether they'd be around the energy policy of self-sufficiency, around energy and feedstocks or environmental policies, has really put a pretty strong focus on opportunity. And so we see the bidding continuing at levels now that it was, say, before the government changed. And one of the hidden opportunities in this new government's focus, frankly, is their real drive to stronger environmental standards, particularly around transportation fuels in and around the large urban cities, we believe is going to start generating a hydrogen opportunity that's kind of a new opportunity in China. We're executing a couple of hydrogen plants as we speak there, but we see more of that opportunity coming.","Operator","We'll go next to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, 2 questions, John, on these additional actions you're taking to enhance the margin. Is this just going to be cost-driven? Are there any further portfolio moves like your exit from PUI? And then secondly, can you just give us the progression of the backlog? What projects are starting up in the next 3 to 6 months? And I know in the past you'd talked about a $0.20, $0.25 EPS benefit from new projects this year. Is that still the number? And what would you expect that number to be in fiscal '14?","John E. McGlade","Yes, Don. Let me take the first part and I'll look to Scott on the second part, if you don't mind. Look, what we're looking at is really overhead and asset, but not business, adjustments to really reflect sort of our current and future view of where the economic growth of the world is going. I think in the last call, I was pretty clear that we like our portfolio as it is. I think good companies continually do assessments of their portfolios, asking the questions around, \"Are you the high-value owner or not?\" And as I sit here today, I'll go back to my comments last quarter and my comments a moment ago that I like the quality of the portfolio we have, but that we will continue to focus to improve the underlying margins and returns of those assets.","M. Scott Crocco","In terms of your second question, Don, this is Scott, the $0.25 we would expect to see for FY '13 is still our number. Recognize that there's been some adjustments in terms of the timing. We have not seen any project cancellations. Obviously, with large projects, delays are not uncommon. But for the year, we would expect to see earnings per share year-on-year growth of $0.25 from new projects coming onstream. And while we haven't yet developed our guidance for next year, as we work through the backlog, we would expect a commensurate amount next year as well as we bring onstream those projects in backlog.","Operator","We'll go next to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","John, you guys have been aggressive in bidding for coal-to-gas projects in China. These are much bigger ASUs so presumably, risk is much higher as well. So how do you make sure you have the right customers? And can you cite the risk for us on these projects?","John E. McGlade","Sure. That's a great question, P.J. And maybe if I go back to when I was in the Tonnage business here in the early 90s and we began looking at hydrogen for refineries, you got a similar set of questions. And the way we looked at that in terms of our own view of risk was really to do pretty robust assessments of the economics of that particular refinery in that case, or this particular gasification project in China. And what I'm really trying to say is will that project, one, with the economics that meet the needs of the energy costs or the feedstock costs that they're producing as opposed to who the ownership of that project is. And the reason we started doing that, if you will, back in the hydrogen days, is you were having a lot of refineries bought by unknown entities. They weren't multinational oil companies operating them anymore. So it's really critical to get an assessment of that project's economics in the context of the marketplace that they operate in. We do the same on these projects in China. And frankly, we've passed on quite a number of them, where we didn't even place bids if we didn't feel either the end product they were going into. So the end products ranged from methanol to synthetic natural gas to chemical building blocks, and we've passed on frankly a lot of the projects that we're in, in areas that we felt, long-term, the economics weren't sustainable. Many of the projects -- most of the projects that we're involved in now and most of the new projects are really in the coal to liquids and the synthetic natural gas, and the economics, the scale, we believe, are competitive with alternative energy sources or feedstock sources in China. But rest assured, it's a question that I ask the team long before we've submitted a bid as to whether or not we should deploy our resources on a particular project. We do earn, as we've talked many times before, higher risk-adjusted returns because of the nature of cost of debt and equity and country risk factors and all of the things that you would expect when you're not operating in other geographies. As you know, we adjust that by the geographies we operate in, and we do ensure that we get a high-quality take-or-pay on-site contract to underpin these projects.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just on the project backlog, I think you mentioned your $3 billion backlog. Do you believe that the backlog has peaked? And where do you see CapEx going? Or do you see CapEx declining over the next 2 or 3 years?","M. Scott Crocco","So, P.J., this is Scott. So as you mentioned, we've got a $3 billion backlog currently and recognize that's going to move around, especially with these projects being fairly large. We would expect for the foreseeable future going forward that the backlog would remain roughly at $3 billion. And in terms of capital spending, this year we said $2 billion, and we think that, that's probably going to be about the range where we come in next year as well, about $2 billion CapEx.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question for you on returns. John, on Slide 16, you were kind enough to give us the time series of returns on capital employed in your appendix, and I guess if I exclude items, it looks like we're at a multi-year low here. But based on your instantaneous calculation, fairly flat over the last 3 quarters. So my question would be, when you take into account the restructuring efforts you have and the new projects that will be flowing through your financials, what is your outlook for returns from here? Do you think we're near bottom?","John E. McGlade","So one of the things that obviously has depressed the returns is, if you think back over the last maybe 18 months to 2 years, our CapEx has picked up both because of the organic opportunities that we have in the marketplace, so hydrogen, large ASUs, as well as the Indura acquisition. And you've got to grow into that quite frankly. And the way we calculate that return, which is a rolling 5-quarter or 4-quarter average, you begin to feel the impact of that gradually over sort of the next year to 1.5 years going forward. As Scott mentioned a moment ago, with CapEx and bidding activity sort of in the range, minus the acquisitions that we have, we should grow into that, if you will. And then the combination of the actions we're taking to drive the performance in the business, the addition of the new project backlog to the P&L now as they come on stream, and some continued gradual economic recovery, one, I would expect returns to improve; and two, they need to return -- improve. And let me turn it over to Scott, and I'm sure he can provide a little bit more color on that.","M. Scott Crocco","Right. So just to build on what John said, Kevin, so I would see the year coming in on a low 10. As John mentioned, we're working through the projects that are in backlog. And as we've talked about in the past, we've got a lot of existing leverage to load the facilities we have. So I would see kind of a bottoming out, either where we are now or maybe in '14. And then as those projects come on from the backlog, immediately start contributing both to earnings and cash flow, as well as loading the existing capacity we have in our system that will then start driving up both returns on capital, cash flow, as well as earnings.","Operator","We'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Another way of looking at the backlog is, as you think about the cadence of projects over the next few years, is the average life cycle extending? I mean, that is, is it taking longer to bring projects onstream once they get into the backlog? And if so, do you have a rough sense for by how much?","John E. McGlade","So -- I mean, let me weigh in a minute, Laurence, and certainly, Simon or Scott can add some additional commentary to what I'm about to say. The reality of it is we get into -- whether it's a refinery project, a gasification project, although the projects in China tend to be quicker perhaps sometimes than the refinery expansions, these are long-cycle projects, 4 years, 3 or 4 years in the making. We get brought into the process maybe a year into the customer's project, and I would argue that projects are 2.5 years on average, some a little less, some a little more depending on where they're located and the customer, frankly, that's building the project. So I can't -- within months, I can't really see a definitive difference in the cycle if I'm comparing it to large hydrogen additions to refineries as we've seen a lot of historically.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I had a couple of questions around the LOX\/LIN strength that you saw in the U.S. and Canada. Are we really just seeing some of the new accounts that have come onstream over the last several quarters? Or are there other things that you could point to that are driving the strength? Kind of how sustainable do you think those volumes could be?","John E. McGlade","Well, good question, Mike, and I appreciate your acknowledging that the team has done a great job with growing those volumes. And I think what you're really seeing is we've been sharing with you some insight into our contract signings over the last year or so, and we're really seeing a benefit of that step-up and that new business coming on stream. As we've said in the past, though, the overall volumes are also dependent on kind of what's happening with our base business, and I think we've seen some good performance in our base business as well. As I mentioned today, contract signings continue to be strong, so we're optimistic that we'll continue to see good volume growth in our U.S.\/Canada LOX\/LIN business.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And now that we've gotten some improvements there, I think the expectation is that we would see some pretty big incremental margin. It doesn't look like that's showing up. Obviously, you've got a lot of moving pieces within Merchant. So if we looked at the U.S. and Canada margin on its own, would that margin have improved sequentially? Or there are enough moving pieces and power costs that, that's still creating some pressure?","M. Scott Crocco","Yes, Mike, this is Scott. So between the -- principally, from the power perspective, that would have been the pressure on the margins, recognizing also the Merchant business will pick up its share of the pension impact as well.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then question on the Mexico business. Have you seen any weakness there related to some of the budget issues that have been going on at PEMEX?","M. Scott Crocco","No, we haven't seen that. Our business in Mexico continues to be very robust, performs well.","John E. McGlade","And, Mike, quite frankly, in the past, we've added that in. To give you some insight in there, if we did add in those Mexico LOX\/LIN volumes, it'd be up a little bit more than even the U.S.\/Canada.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Got you. And then last one I had is on equipment and energy. You noted the earnings are progressing about in line with the initial guidance, which was for a $0.05 EPS tailwind this year. If I do the math, it looks like you're a little bit ahead of that piece, and it would suggest that Q4 would be down sequentially, but the guidance slide calls for that to be up sequentially. So is it fair to say you're now looking for more than $0.05 of EPS tailwind? And what are your thoughts, maybe kind of early thoughts, on what next year looks like in terms of LNG activity and the Equipment and Energy business?","M. Scott Crocco","Mike, this is Scott. We know that in this business, it's a little bit lumpy. And so just directionally, maybe it's a little bit higher than $0.05 year-on-year, but not huge. And I think as we mentioned before, we continue to see opportunities out there on a global basis, and we continue to not only work down the backlog but look for additional orders and look to have announcements in the not-too-distant future.","Operator","We'll go next to James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Guys, could you just comment a little bit about Merchant pricing trends in Asia?","Simon R. Moore","Yes, Jim, this is Simon. It's a good question. And again, I think one of the things that we need to make sure we're keeping an eye on is not just price on its own, but also kind of the price\/cost trade-off. And so specifically in Asia, we have seen some price pressure in our LOX\/LIN\/LAR, liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen and liquid argon business. So we've seen some negative pricing in Asia in those businesses, and that's come at the same time that we're seeing some power cost increases. So we're seeing -- as we commented, that's one of the key issues that's creating a little bit of a margin squeeze for us in that business. Now if I could just -- the helium scenario is different than what I've just described. Helium pricing has been strong and positive in all the regions.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Gulley with BGC Partners.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Well, I was going back to the strong backlog of $3 billion. Can you give us an indication and, of course, the whole gasification opportunity in China, about how much of that backlog is in China? And would that number change materially when you get to include some of the hydrogen projects that you've just alluded to?","M. Scott Crocco","So, Mark, this is Scott. I would say about half or so of the backlog is in China. And again, we've got a lot of different opportunities on a global basis, so I would see that number staying about that -- in that range going forward.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And then secondly, as a follow-up, you talked about the additional restructuring actions, so we're going to hear more a month or so. Looking at the low operating rates, particularly for LOX\/LIN in U.S. and Europe, is it safe to assume that you've got to have some asset write-downs, plant closings there to tighten up capacity, maybe get some pricing flexibility? And could that be a big part of the margin improvement you expect to see in Merchant?","M. Scott Crocco","Mark, this is Scott. So we're looking at each -- as we've said before, we're looking at each of our businesses and identifying opportunities to make sure that we are rightsized given the economic environment and the level of business activity. And so there's -- every area of the company is under evaluation.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And a housekeeping question on PUI being a negative factor. Do we finally lap that in the second quarter of fiscal '14?","M. Scott Crocco","Well -- so it's going to go away at the end of this calendar year, and so we'll see -- in '14, we'll see a year-on-year impact, 1 quarter seen in '14 versus a full year that we saw here in '13. That will take us a while before we lap it.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had to hop off for a minute, so I apologize if this has been covered, but I wanted to just dive in a little bit into working capital and also pension. The working capital increase so far year-to-date, I believe that's not including Indura. But correct me if I'm wrong about that. Can you just help me understand what's driving it and how that might play out over the balance or, I guess, the one remaining quarter, and then what you might be able to do to improve it going into next year?","M. Scott Crocco","So this is Scott. So working capital does in fact include Indura. We track closely all our accounts and look at past dues, day sales outstanding and so forth. And so there's not -- recognizing there's a mix across the different geographies, we are diligently managing that, and we don't see any issues in terms of working capital.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So x Indura, it looks fine. And then on the pension, given the idea that rates may be increasing in the near future and you made a big pension contribution, I see here, how should we be thinking about that relative to your liability going into next year?","M. Scott Crocco","Let's separate it into 2 pieces. First, the cash and ERISA requirement versus the book accounting. From an ERISA perspective, we feel good about the level of contributions that have been made and don't foresee any large additional contributions in the near term. If I shift then to a book perspective, as you point out, rates -- who knows where they're going to go? But to the extent that they do go up and then reduce the liability on a present value basis, there might be some tailwinds going forward from a book accounting perspective and pensions in the future.","Operator","We'll go next to John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Ernie Ortiz","This is actually Ernie Ortiz filling in for John. Just on the helium project, with the startup of the project, you've been benefiting with some good pricing recently. Can you just talk about the supply\/demand impacts from the new project? How should we think about pricing going forward? And just on overall industry, kind of how it affects it?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. So, Ernie, let me just make a few comments broadly about helium. And so first of all, setting a context that we think over a multi-year time frame, helium remains tight, why is that? We've got increased demand, customers are utilizing more helium in medical applications, in the electronics industry and in welding applications. And at the same time, today, 30% of the world's helium comes from the U.S. government, and that opportunity to supply is declining over time. So there are new sources that are needed to come on to replace some of the decline in existing sources, and we have increasing demand. So that's the kind of long-term time frame. If we step back from that a little bit, we have our project in Wyoming that we expect to get product from later this year. You've also seen, for the industry, some new projects come onstream here just recently. So those projects will help. But quite frankly, again, it's in a framework where the demand is increasing and some of the existing supply is coming down. I would also just note that you might have heard me mention that we have another project, separate from this Wyoming project, that we would expect to have an announcement on fairly soon.","Ernie Ortiz","Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, on Electronics, can you talk about like where industry operating rates are and kind of your outlook for '14 for Electronics?","Simon R. Moore","Sure. I think Electronics -- so first of all, maybe reset for FY '13, our fiscal year, we expect Electronics square inches of silicon demand to be down somewhere in the 0 to a few percent, and that's different than what we had expected of mid-single digit growth when we set out for the year. So clearly, the industry has not grown the way we and others expected for the year. I think -- as we look to 2014, I think the industry forecasts we see are generally up in that mid-single digits range, but we're going to have to take a very hard look at that as we get closer to the end of the year here. I think if there's one good thing in the industry, while it hasn't been a strong growth period, you've seen a relative amount of stability, where inventory levels have maintained relatively stable levels for our customers along this time.","Operator","We'll go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question on Indura. If you look apples-to-apples, what would margins look like this quarter versus a year ago?","M. Scott Crocco","For Indura? Just to clarify.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, for Indura. Yes.","M. Scott Crocco","They'd be up modestly as we go through the integration and deliver on the synergies that we've expected there as part of the implementation.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then just last one, quick on Tees Valley. On-time, on-budget there? How is that progressing?","John E. McGlade","Yes, it's progressing quite well. I was over there a month or 2 ago, and the project is on budget, on schedule. The team's really, really charged up about the opportunity and already looking at ways to further improve the existing project authorization through some of the opportunities they've been able to identify.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just on the Tees Valley and that concept, from a timing standpoint, will we get that plant up and running and proven out before we announce new projects? Or is there a chance that we get new projects before we've actually proven out that system?","John E. McGlade","Well, first, what I'd suggest is every unit op in that facility is a unit op that we operate or have operated across our assets over the years. It's just really the combination of those unit ops. So from a technology point of view and an operating point of view, while we've done very rigorous assessments across -- with internal and external experts, I'm very comfortable with our ability to do this. And I'm very comfortable in our ability to do it with the reliability and capabilities that we've committed to our customer base. So we're going to make decisions on the opportunities for these projects based on the market availability of them, and then frankly, being a first mover into the market, given the profitability of these projects and the opportunity of that to deliver value to our shareholders.","Operator","We'll go next to Basili Alukos with Morningstar.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I commend the work you guys are doing on kind of re-looking at the portfolio and all the cost structure, but I kind of want to go back to that issue. If I go back to 2010 when you had your Analyst Day, you talked about -- originally, there, you had 17% margins. We're looking to get to 20%. There are a lot of puts and takes that have happened from then until now. Obviously, Europe is probably worse than what you expected. I think you talked about Indura maybe being a little bit of -- pulling down margin, at least in the near term. So maybe, at best, we can say the company is at a push for margins relative to that time frame. So kind of in that context, I'm just wondering how you're thinking and taking into account the commentary that you like the portfolio. It looks like margins really haven't kept up, so I'm just wondering, in that context, how are you further thinking about kind of the portfolio?","John E. McGlade","Well, certainly -- let me start with -- where our margins are today aren't acceptable to me. I understand that we need to improve them. And what I was really trying to say, both in the actions we've said we're evaluating, that will help us in that context. As it relates specifically to the portfolio, my commentary there is I like our business positions. I don't necessarily -- around the globe, I don't necessarily like the economic scenarios today in all of those positions, but the combination of the actions we're taking and an expectation, as Scott mentioned in his talk, that Europe is bottoming, Simon's comments on Electronics a little bit ago, where we're probably getting towards the bottom of the cycle there as well, really, I believe, will be accretive to margins as we begin to see some economic uptick over the next number of quarters. The other point I'd make relative to the discussion that you referenced back to in the '10, '11 time frame was one of the things that -- on the positives that has developed is the on-site opportunities driven either by the energy or policy or environmental regulations in China and more broadly, around the globe, that gives us a higher mix of Tonnage. In the short term, that higher mix of Tonnage has some depression on margins as you work through the capital in construction. So you have a depression on margins. Frankly -- typically, on the Tonnage businesses, you have lower absolute margins because of the nature of the energy pass-through, but frankly, also lower absolute risk because of the contract.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. So I guess if I think about it in hypotheticals, speaking, if the economy and the rest of the regions were some type of normal growth and margins were still depressed, then it would be more likely in that scenario to see further pruning and divestitures of the portfolio? And that's more trying to get cost structure in line until the economy, at least in Europe, turned around?","John E. McGlade","Yes. I mean, to be clear -- and I meant what I said. I do like the portfolio that we have today. There are assets and overhead opportunities broadly across the globe, and we'll work on those.","Operator","We'll go next to Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but on Electronics, revenues were a little bit lighter than expected, but your margins improved. Was wondering what was driving the margin improvement. Was that mix or cost-cutting?","Simon R. Moore","Well -- so it's really -- I mean, it's a combination of both. Right? We obviously aren't in a robust growth environment from Electronics, and it's still a good job by the team to share margin improvements. Specifically year-on-year, we did have a mix effect in the electronics equipment business that helped that as well.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And one thing that struck out at me with your slide on Merchant Gases and just the different pricing trends across the different geographies, the operating rates, the LOX\/LIN capacity utilization rates are actually lower in the US and Canada, but you had positive pricing. And in Europe and Asia, you're in the mid-70%s and you have negative pricing. So what accounts for the deltas there in terms of pricing? Is it just the quality of competitors? Or is there anyone out there that's being particularly disruptive on pricing -- or had been in the past, as being less disciplined?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. So I think you make a good observation. And I will say, for the last few quarters, we have seen pricing dynamics that aren't necessarily exactly correlated with overall regional loading rates, right? And so this isn't a commodity business, right? It's a very local business. So specifically, your question on what's happening in pricing, we've got some price pressures across all of the regions, particularly, again, I'm speaking of the LOX\/LIN\/LAR business. So we are seeing some price pressure in Europe, where prices are coming down. In the U.S.\/Canada and LOX\/LIN, while prices are stable, we've got input costs going up. And in Asia, quite frankly, we've got higher power costs and higher -- and LOX\/LIN prices coming down. So I don't know that we would necessarily select one competitor as creating this competitive pressure, but I think you are seeing some price pressure across LOX\/LIN, again contrasting that with helium, where pricing continues to be strong.","Operator","This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over for any closing or additional remarks.","John E. McGlade","Thanks, Jessica. Let me just wrap up by saying our focus on increasing shareholder value remains unwavering. Our emphasis on cost reduction, productivity improvement and disciplined project execution remain key priorities. Our future prospects are strong given our record project backlog and the significant leverage we have in our existing assets. You'll have an opportunity to see a replay of this call at 2 p.m. today. And thank you for joining us, and have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our CEO; and Paul Huck, our CFO. John will first provide our overall perspective on the year, Paul will review our 2012 and Q4 results, I will review the segment results, Paul will provide an outlook for Q1 and 2013 and finally, John will provide some longer-term perspectives. Our comments today are slightly longer than normal so we would ask you to limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up, please.","We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials.

As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations.","Now I'll turn the call over to John.","John E. McGlade","Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before I share my perspective on the year, I did want to make a few comments. As you've seen from our earlier announcement, Paul has decided to retire from Air Products at the end of February. After 33 years of exemplary service to this organization, he has decided now is the right time to step back and spend more time with family and on other endeavors.  Paul has been with Air Products since 1979 and has served as our Chief Financial Officer since 2004. Over that time, he has exemplified the best of everything we stand for. He has seen this company grow tremendously during his tenure and has been a key player in every step of the way as a leader, mentor and trusted colleague.","I think I speak for the entire Air Products' Board of Directors and the entire Air Products community when I say he will be greatly missed. Paul will remain with Air Products through February in order to transition his role to Scott Crocco.","Scott has been at Air Products for 22 years and has extensive experience in all areas of finance, including serving as the financial manager for many of our businesses. Scott currently serves as Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. I know that Paul plans to introduce Scott to many of you over the coming weeks and months so that you'll have the chance to get to know him as he moves into his new role. While we are sorry to be losing Paul, we understand his decision and have every confidence in Scott's ability to help take this organization forward.","Now please turn to Slide #3 for a review of the key highlights from our fiscal year 2012. Let me begin by saying the global economy certainly proved to be more challenging than we expected for 2012, and we did not see the anticipated step up in economic growth in the second half of our fiscal year.","To summarize, for the year, we saw global manufacturing growth of about 3%, toward the low end of our planning range. This obviously impacted our volume growth, particularly in our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials segments.","During the year, we did take important steps to position our portfolio for future success. We sold our European Homecare business and implemented a significant restructuring program to bring our costs in line with a slower economy in Europe. And as we announced this morning, we are exiting our polyurethane intermediates business and are restructuring our photovoltaic business to reflect current market conditions. Paul will provide more details on these actions shortly.","We continue to execute on acquisition opportunities to support our strategies. In July, we closed on the purchase of a majority position in Indura, the largest independent gas company in Latin America.","This year, we also invested in a 25% position in Abdullah Hashim Group, the largest industrial gas company in Saudi Arabia. And this week, we announced a complementary joint venture with ACWA, the Arabian company for power and water development, to focus on large-scale industrial gas opportunities within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Finally, we purchased the remaining 50% of our DA NanoMaterials joint venture.","We also continue to be successful in winning profitable projects in the key energy, environmental and emerging markets. Our 2012 capital expenditure was a record $2.8 billion, including significant wins in oxygen for coal gasification in China. We are now executing 6 projects in this exciting growth market, totaling over 28,000 tons per day of oxygen.  Bidding activity remains strong as these projects are driven by China's drive for energy independence.","We completed the world's largest hydrogen pipeline network in the United States Gulf Coast. This system allows us to offer customers the highest levels of reliability and flexibility while enabling us to optimize the energy cost and volumes from the system. As one example, Motiva awarded us a significant new hydrogen deal, in part due to the flexibility created by the pipeline, demonstrating again the competitive advantage this pipeline gives us.","We continue to win key on-site projects in our Electronics business, notably with Samsung for their large new complex in Xi'an, China; and UMC for their growth in Tainan, Taiwan.","In the energy area, we announced new LNG orders in Malaysia and Australia, and we announced the exciting new energy from waste project in Tees Valley, United Kingdom. This project leverages our on-site business model and our significant operating experience to create a renewable source of energy for the U.K. market.","And very importantly, we increased our dividend for the 30th consecutive year, something we are very proud of. While I'm pleased with these key actions, I am disappointed by our earnings growth in 2012. We simply must improve our performance in 2013 and beyond.","We have increased the number of resources focused on loading existing capacity, and we continue to step up resources devoted to delivering additional productivity in our fixed and variable costs. To be clear, we aren't relying on improved economic conditions. We are committed to actions we can control that will deliver improving results in the near term.","Paul will now review our 2012 results.","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide #4. Before we get into the operating results, I want to spend a moment reviewing a few items with you. The first 2 are focused on our portfolio restructuring efforts. First, we decided to exit our polyurethane intermediates business and have shut down our Pasadena, Texas polyurethane intermediates production facility, resulting in an after-tax charge of $35 million or $0.16 per share.","Polyurethane intermediates was one of our legacy chemicals businesses that we've been running for cash for a number of years. We have established a buy\/resell arrangement with the buyer of the business to serve the 2 remaining supply contracts, the largest of which expires at the end of 2013. As a result, we would expect a negative fiscal year '13 revenue impact of about $100 million and a negative EPS impact of about $0.05.","Also during the fourth quarter, we completed an assessment of our position in the photovoltaic market, resulting in an after-tax charge of $127 million or $0.59 per share, primarily within our electronics business. Consistent with the external market forecast, we had anticipated significant demand growth for thin film, or Gen2 solar panels.","To support this market, we entered into a long-term take or pay supply agreement in 2009 for the purchase of xylene gas. For a variety of reasons, the thin-film PV market did not develop as the industry expected, resulting in global xylene capacity of about 4x to 5x global demand. We are in negotiations to terminate our xylene contract. This charge reflects estimated termination charges, loss on purchase commitments and the write-down of production and distribution assets, inventory and accounts receivable. Further details on these 2 items are available in the footnotes to the earnings release.","Finally, we also recorded an after-tax charge of $6 million, or $0.03 per share, to write down our assets at Sparrows Point, Maryland, related to a customer bankruptcy and mill closure. The facility served the steel mill as well as the merchant market with a piggyback liquefier. The assets cannot be redeployed for alternative use.","Excluding these 3 items, our adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations is $1.42 for the quarter, at the low end of our $1.42 to $1.47 guidance range and up slightly versus last year and last quarter. To help you with the quarterly comparisons, Slide #18 in the appendix shows earnings per share from continuing operations x disclosed items for the last 2 years.","As John mentioned, we closed on the purchase of 65% of Indura in July, so the fourth quarter includes a full quarter of Indura results. 100% of Indura is included in our merchant results, with the profits from the portion we don't own eliminated from the P&L in the noncontrolling interest line. Our integration efforts are progressing well, and we are on track to deliver on our expected cost synergies and growth opportunities.","Regarding the remaining European Homecare business located in the U.K. and Ireland, we have received bids from interested parties, and we hope to close on the sale of the remaining business before the end of calendar year 2012. As an update to our Q2 European restructuring, we continue to make good progress on our cost reduction plan and, in fact, saw about $6 million of benefit in the past quarter, making the total for 2012 about $10 million of benefit, consistent with our plans. When fully implemented in 2013, we expect the cost reduction plan to provide $60 million of annual savings.","Now please turn to Slide #5 for a review of our 2012 results. Sales of $9.6 billion were down 1%. Currency and energy pass-through were both negative 2%, while acquisitions added 2%. Our underlying sales grew 1% from higher tonnage volumes being partially offset by weakness across our Merchant segment, particularly in Europe.","Overall, volume growth was much more modest than we had hoped. While this is primarily due to a weak macroenvironment, particularly in Europe and Asia, we are not pleased with our performance to load our plants.","In our Merchant segment, overall volumes were down 2%. Volume growth of 6% in Tonnage Gases principally came from new investments and contracts. In Electronics, growth in on-site and equipment was offset by lower specialty materials demand. Our operating income of $1.5 billion declined 1%, and our operating margin for the year was 16%. Earnings per share were up 1%. And not surprisingly, given our higher capital spending, weak asset loading and acquisitions this past year, our after-tax return on capital employed declined by 100 basis points to 11.5%, still well above our 8% cost of capital.","Now let's turn to our results for the quarter on Slide #6. Overall results were within our expectations. However, again, weaker economic growth prevented volumes from growing as much as we had forecast, and we had headwinds from the stronger dollar. Despite this weaker environment, pricing held firm.","For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 4% higher versus prior year in total. On an underlying basis, sales were also up 4% on higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases, Equipment and Energy and Electronics and Performance Materials segments.","Our Indura and DA NanoMaterials acquisitions contributed 6%, which was offset by unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts. Sequentially, overall sales grew 11%. Underlying sales increased 3% on higher volumes across all segments. Additionally, the Indura acquisition contributed 6%. Simon will provide segment and geographic details later.","Operating income of $408 million increased 3% versus prior year and prior quarter. Our operating margin of 15.7% was down slightly versus prior year. The impact of the acquisition and associated costs was a negative 50 basis points. Sequentially, our margins declined 130 basis points due to the Indura acquisition, higher energy prices and higher operating and distribution costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share were both up modestly versus last year and sequentially.","Turning to Slide #7 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations' earnings per share of $1.42 increased by $0.01 versus last year. Volumes increased earnings per share by $0.05, including $0.06 from acquisitions. And as a reminder, last year's fourth quarter included $0.05 of good news from tonnage contract modifications, which did not repeat this year.","Let me take a minute and talk about the overall impact of Indura. Indura sales were about $140 million this quarter, or a run rate of about 10% higher in local currency terms than the March -- last 12 months' net numbers we communicated when we announced the deal in June.","Within the Merchant segment, we had about $6 million of transaction cost, with another $5 million of one-time financing cost captured in the interest expense line. Overall, given the acquisition cost and consistent with what we communicated last quarter, Indura was about a $0.03 headwind for us this quarter.","Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together increased earnings per share by $0.01. Positive cost performance was $0.02 favorable. Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together were $0.03 unfavorable.  Equity affiliate income and noncontrolling interest taken together were neutral.","As a reminder, last year, we disclosed $0.04 of good news in our equity affiliate lines from non-operational items, which was offset by an accounting adjustment of a similar amount in noncontrolling interest. What you see here is essentially the reversal of that trend -- of that item as a prior year variance. And finally, interest expense was $0.04 higher due to the Indura acquisition.","Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 8, Merchant Gases.","Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 8% versus prior year, primarily driven by the Indura acquisition. Underlying sales were down 3% on 4% lower volumes and 1% positive price. The volume effect on sales was impacted by contract modifications in the prior year in U.S.\/Canada. Excluding that effect, volumes would have been down 2%. We also had a 4% negative currency impact.","Sales were up 16% sequentially, again primarily driven by Indura. Underlying sales were up 1% on a 1% volume improvement and flat pricing, and currency had a negative 1% effect.","Merchant Gases' operating income of $161 million was down 5% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 15.8% was down 210 basis points compared to last year and down 300 basis points sequentially.","Versus last year, operating income was down on lower volumes, particularly helium and Europe packaged gases and negative currency. Partially offsetting this were benefits from our Europe cost reduction programs and profits from the Indura acquisition.","Excluding Indura, the operating margin this quarter would have been 17.2% or 140 basis points higher. As we discussed when we announced the Indura acquisition, their operating margins are below our Merchant segment average due to approximately half of their sales being in lower-margin hard goods. As Paul said, the Merchant Q4 segment results include about $6 million of one-time acquisition costs. Excluding the acquisition costs, Indura's margins were in the low double-digits, about what we expected.","Versus prior quarter, we did see the negative impact of higher power costs and lower ASU plant output with the higher summer temperatures. And we saw higher distribution costs, particularly in North America, due to tight helium and argon supply.","Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In U.S.\/Canada, sales were down 6% on lower volumes and flat pricing. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes were down slightly. While we are successfully bringing onstream the business we previously signed, we are seeing a number of customers shut down operations or stop using gases and, in a few cases, switched to competitive supply.","Helium availability remains a challenge, and helium volumes were down as both domestic and overseas sources did not supply as expected. We hope to get feedstock to bring our new Wyoming facility onstream late in our fiscal year 2013 and expect helium to remain tight until at least then.","Paul mentioned the shutdown of the Sparrows Point facility. As we discussed last quarter, this impacted our argon availability. We are working hard to improve argon recovery at other facilities. For example, we recently moved quickly to redeploy an idle asset to a facility in a region with supply shortages. Overall, if we had the helium and argon we had expected, and excluding the impact of the contract modifications, U.S.\/Canada volumes would have been up 1% rather than down 6%.","Pricing was flat, with helium increases offsetting slightly lower LOX\/LIN\/LAR pricing. Contract signings stayed at the high level we saw through the first 3 quarters and are up 15% versus last year. And LOX\/LIN capacity utilization remained in the low 70s.","In Europe, sales were down 12% versus last year, primarily due to currency, with underlying sales down 3%. Volumes were down 4% on weaker demand for both packaged gases and liquid\/bulk, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Helium volumes were down on supply availability.","Despite the weaker demand environment, pricing remained positive, up 1%. LOX\/LIN plant reloadings remain in the low 80s, and new contract signings were at target.","In Asia, sales were down 1% versus last year. Underlying sales were flat on 2% positive price and 2% lower volumes as we are clearly seeing effect of lower demand, particularly in China in electronics. LOX\/LIN volumes, excluding conversions, were up 2%. Liquid argon volumes were down significantly, particularly on lower PV demand in China.","One bright spot was the continued success of our Microbulk product line. Despite the slower growth environment, pricing was up 2% on positive packaged gas and flat liquid\/bulk pricing. Plant loadings were in the mid-70s. And new contract signings for the quarter were down slightly, but we finished the year well ahead of last year.","We continue to demonstrate application technology successes, helping our customers use our products to reduce environmental emissions, increase output and improve product quality, among other benefits. We announced a new contract to provide a full oxy-fuel solution to Jinxin Glass in Henan, China, including our PRISM VSA oxygen generator and Cleanfire oxy-fuel burners. And we announced an order to provide similar systems to 5 CEMEX cement factories in Spain.","Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases' sales of $846 million were down 4% versus last year, driven by a negative 7% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 2% impact from currency. Volumes were up 5%, about evenly split between base volume growth and new projects. Sequentially, sales were up 10%, with 4% higher volumes and a positive 6% impact of higher energy pass-through.","Operating income of $141 million was down 7% versus prior year. The volume growth and lower costs from strong operating performance improved profits. However, the PUI business delivered about $10 million less operating income than last year and, as Paul mentioned, in Q4 of last year, we had a net gain from contract modifications of about $15 million that did not repeat this year.","Operating income was up 5% sequentially as the higher volumes more than offset lower PUI results. Operating margin of 16.7% declined 50 basis points versus prior year, as the lower PUI results and prior year contract modifications reduced operating income. Margin declined 80 basis points sequentially on lower PUI results and higher natural gas prices.","We announced 2 more oxygen projects in China for coal gasification: a new 2,000-ton per day ASU in Hebei for Cangzhou Zhengyuan Fertilizer that will also produce liquid products for the merchant market and a 2,000-ton per day project in Guiyang with Guizhou Kaiyang, a subsidiary of Yankuang Group, with whom we are currently executing a 12,000-ton per day project in Shaanxi. The new project in Guiyang will also provide liquid products to the merchant market.","Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics & Performance Materials. Segment sales of $617 million were up 5% versus last year. Underlying sales were up 3% on 4% higher volumes and 1% lower prices. Sequential sales were up 2% on higher volumes.","Electronic sales were up 9% versus last year on strong tonnage and equipment results and the DA Nano acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, Electronic's material sales were down versus last year as we did not see the typical seasonal volume improvement.","Sales were up 10% sequentially, again on strong tonnage and equipment results. Electronic materials pricing remained relatively stable, with the exception of xylene, as we mentioned last quarter.","Performance Material sales were down 1% versus last year as volume growth was offset by lower prices and currency had a negative 3% impact. Volumes were positive in North America and strong in Asia, but weaker in Europe. Sequentially, sales were down 7% on lower volumes in all regions due to general economic weakness, a slower construction market and cautious customer supply chain management.","We saw lower prices, both versus last year and sequentially, but are also seeing lower raw material costs. Operating income of $85 million was down 7% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 180 basis points to 13.8%.","We had positive contributions from the higher volumes and good productivity performance, but this was more than offset by the impact of inventory revaluation. This was positive last year and negative this year, consistent with lower raw material prices this year. The segment effect is largely offset at the corporate level. Slide 21 in the appendix provides more detail. The net year-on-year impact of the inventory revaluation is 360 basis points.","Sequentially, operating income was down 6%, and operating margin was down 120 basis points. The sequential impact of the inventory revaluation is 180 basis points.","In Electronics, we announced a contract to supply 4 new phases of UMC's Fab 12A complex in the Tainan Science Industrial Park in Taiwan. We will build a new ASU, additional pipelines and a bulk supply system to complement our existing ASU and pipeline system in the Tainan Science Park, where we supply major semiconductor and TFT-LCD manufacturers.","Now please turn to Slide 12, Equipment & Energy. Sales of $126 million were up 32% versus prior year, primarily on higher ASU project activity. Sequentially, sales were up 33%, primarily on higher ASU and LNG project activity.","Operating income of $18 million was up 54% versus prior year on the higher activity and better cost performance. Sequentially, income was up 81% on higher LNG project activity.","Backlog is up 35% over last year and up slightly over last quarter as LNG project development continues to be strong. In August, we announced an energy from waste project in Tees Valley, U.K. This innovative growth opportunity leverages our on-site business model and our experience with gasification, syngas cleanup and power generation. And just to clarify, this project is included in our capital spending backlog, not our Equipment and Energy sale of equipment backlog.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 13. Now let me give you a brief summary of our outlook.","We saw the second half 2012 slower than the first half in most regions. Given this lack of momentum, we expect that economic growth will be modest at best in 2013.","Globally, for the regions we operate in, we are forecasting manufacturing growth of 2% to 4%. While U.S. manufacturing has been a relative bright spot, we have seen growth slow as consumer confidence remains low, job creation disappoints and concern continues regarding the potential fiscal cliff at the end of the calendar year. European problems remain, and we do not expect meaningful growth anytime soon.","In Asia, we have not seen the impact of Chinese stimulus actions, and the rest of developing Asia continues to experience below-trend growth as exports to Europe and the U.S. are slow. And we expect 2% to 4% growth in South America.","We are hopeful that electronics growth will begin to rebound in 2013 from a weak 2012. Overall, for the year, we expect square inches of silicon processed to be up 4% to 6% next year.","On the positive side, our project development and contract signings continue to be very strong. A number of these orders are in China for the gasification of coal. These projects are driven by the government's goal of developing domestic sources of energy and feedstocks, utilizing their vast coal reserves.","We expect 2013 capital expenditures to be $2 billion to $2.2 billion. This is comparable to the $2.1 billion spent in 2012, excluding the $700 million for Indura. Our project backlog has increased again to about $3 billion, securing future profitable growth. We are beginning to see some slowing in a few of our customers' projects as they reflect the growing economic uncertainty. You can see an updated list of our major projects in appendix, Slide #17, and a geographic and business segment capital expenditures split in Slide #19.","To help you with historical comparisons, Slide #20 in the appendix shows non-GAAP capital expenditures, which includes capital lease expenditures. This is on the same basis as our $2 billion to $2.2 billion guidance for 2013.","Based on this, our initial earnings per share guidance range is $5.65 to $5.85 per share for 2013. While economic outcomes could vary, we are prepared to execute our business plans and adapt to whatever economic environment emerges.","Walking from our 2012 earnings per share of $5.40, we have the following factors:","New plant onstreams in 2012 and 2013 should add about $0.25 to $0.30. These are projects that are either onstream now or will be onstream soon and are backed by contractual commitments to buy. This number is slightly below our previous expectations as we have seen some customer-related delays in new project onstreams.","Loading existing assets should add $0.10 to $0.20 to EPS. This is the factor most influenced by the economy.","Indura, net of interest expense, should add about $0.10 versus last year, with the polyurethane intermediates business divestiture reducing earnings per share by about $0.05.","In Equipment and Energy, we expect operating results will be higher due to more LNG activity. This is a $0.05 tailwind.","Our cost reduction in Europe should add about $0.15 a share, somewhat offsetting the positives. Pension expense will be about a $0.20 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from September 2011 to September 2012.","We expect currency and taxes to be a headwind. And given our continued strong capital spending, we would expect interest expense and shares outstanding to both increase modestly. Overall, about a $0.10 to $0.15 headwind.","Now let's turn to our first quarter outlook on Slide 14. Our guidance for quarter 1 is for earnings per share of $1.26 to $1.31 based on the following factors:","On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from new plant onstreams. Further, progress on our cost initiatives will continue and the Indura acquisition transaction costs in quarter 4 won't repeat.","Offsetting this sequential improvement, in Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect lower seasonal demand and lower equipment sales. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to seasonally higher maintenance spending and lower volumes as refineries begin taking their annual outages. We will see lower Equipment and Energy profits in the first quarter based on project timing, although we do expect a rebound through the rest of the year and higher pension expense, as previously mentioned.","Now let me call -- now let me turn the call back over to John to wrap up.","John E. McGlade","Thanks, Paul. While we are pleased with the expected long-term positive impact of the portfolio actions we completed this year, we were disappointed with our overall performance during 2012.","In June of 2011, we shared our 2015 goals of $15 billion in revenue, 20% operating margin and a 15% return on capital employed. Since then, the global economy has only delivered about half of the approximate 5% manufacturing growth that underpinned our expectations. This had a significant impact on our recent performance, particularly on merchant asset loading.","Further, while we have improved productivity, it is not at the level we need it to be. We remain focused on attaining the operating margin goal of 20% and the return on capital employed goal of 15%. However, based on the continued slow economy, we don't expect to be able to reach our goals in 2015. Given the lack of economic clarity, we are not in a position to predict exactly when we will reach these goals at this time.","Now let me talk about some of our near-term actions as we drive improvement towards these margin and return goals. We need to be more successful in driving volume growth in our merchant businesses, utilizing the investment in place to leverage margin improvement.","Our focus in Europe remains on implementing our cost reduction plan as quickly as possible, ensuring we get to the $60 million per year of benefit, early in 2013. We've also recently brought onstream a new pricing analysis tool that should help us better target our pricing actions and improve both margins and returns in our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials segments.","In Tonnage, we have brought onstream and are executing a large number of new plants. We have to execute these projects on time and on budget and improve our plant efficiencies to drive further return improvement.","The Electronics and Performance Materials businesses have seen significant improvement over the past few years. We need to continue to drive margin improvement and growth in these businesses through new products and focusing on our major customers.","We have won a number of new LNG orders this year. We expect the global interest in LNG to lead to an expanded project list over the next few years so we are adding additional manufacturing capacity in Florida.","Finally, 2012 margin and returns were helped by productivity and cost reductions. We must continue to lower our fixed costs, improve our operating efficiencies and leverage our fixed cost base as volumes expand.","While our 2012 results are disappointing, and 2013 remains uncertain from an economic growth standpoint, we are focused on the key actions we can control to deliver our margin and return goals. As we end today's call, again, I would like to thank Paul for his 33 years of service to Air Products and especially these past 8 years as our Chief Financial Officer. I'd also like to extend my congratulations to Scott Crocco.","Scott and Paul will both be on our next quarterly earnings call at the end of January.","Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Leah to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on Merchant Gases. It seems like Merchant business has been a work in progress for a couple of years. Now Indura seems to be margin dilutive. So when do you think you can get your margins back to sort of normalized range of 18%, keeping in mind that your long-term goal is 21% to 24%?","Paul E. Huck","So P.J., if we take a look at that, one of the key aspects here, which has been holding out on margins, has been our loading. And so as we've talked about that, we think that, that's an important aspect of bringing us back here. So the loading in the U.S., the loading in China, principally, given the load factors that we're at -- and that's going to be one of the things which boost it. In Europe, it is going to be the price reduction -- it is going to be the reduction in cost, which we need to put in. The bulk of that -- of this $60 million in savings will flow through Europe. And plus some pickup in the economy, eventually in Europe, will help loading, particularly in the packaged gas area where we have seen continued declines and things like the holdings of people holding the amount of cylinders, has declined in Europe steadily for the past 3 or 4 years. If we start the -- if that starts to pick up, people will start to hold more of those. The rental aspect, that flows directly back to our bottom line. So it's going to take some form of an economic pickup for us to see those things happen.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then secondly, you've been spending your CapEx at a rate of about more than 2x DNA. And now you mentioned today that some customers are delaying projects. I was just wondering if you can add some light on which area, which segments that customers are delaying these projects.","Paul E. Huck","And the places in which we've seen that, P.J., have principally been in hydrogen within the U.S. We've seen project delays in the Electronics business. We have not seen any significant delays in China on the gasification projects that are underway right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the CapEx. So we had a pretty aggressive CapEx build-out that was laid out at the Investor Day last year. Since then, the world's grown about half what you thought. You've talked about some people delaying some projects. Your stock is in a much -- more attractive level price-wise now. When you compare kind of doing stock buybacks to continuing aggressive build-out into what seems like scenarios that already have a little bit of oversupply, is there any thought of pulling back a little bit on CapEx and kind of readjusting that growth in a slower growth environment?","John E. McGlade","Yes. I think -- Duffy, this is John. I think what you got to look at is certainly, at a macro level, the economy is growing a lot slower than we anticipated. But more broadly, if you look at the on-site -- and most of our capital's going into our Tonnage business, which I really believe secures our long-term future growth and cash flows and, in turn, profitability, and most of that's going into either oxygen for gasification, largely in China and, up until very recently, hydrogen projects, again, largely in North America or the United States. And as we have for many, many years, we've been very clear about communicating sort of our priorities for the use of cash, which is really to reinvest in the businesses that fit and opportunities that fit our strategy. If you look at the total CapEx, something like 80%, 85% of the growth CapEx in these last couple of years has been in our Tonnage or on-site business model-type of investments.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just on photovoltaics in particular, could you size that business for us currently within your portfolio and then just kind of talk about what the volume growth in photovoltaics was for you last year and what you expect this next year?","Paul E. Huck","Sure. If you take a look at PV, PV between Electronics and the Merchant area is about 5% -- is about $50 million in each, or about $100 million in total. In the electronics area, that's where we sell the xylene, that's where we sell -- that's where we serve the bulk of the Gen2 customers, which this charge is more related to [indiscernible]. So it's about -- a little under 5% of our cyclical [ph] sales and electronic stuff we sell into their -- into that area. In Merchant, we principally serve the people who make the polycrystalline solar, and that's where we sell them LIN and argon for those things.","John E. McGlade","The only -- I'd just like to add the point, if I may, that we're not proud about this decision. It was a terrible decision and a terrible assessment of the market opportunity at a different point in time when the world looked a lot different, and we recognize the impact that this has to our shareholders. I do think, however, from the standpoint of the business, acknowledging this, putting this behind us, I think you'll begin to see the benefits that we've been able to put into the improvement of the overall Electronics business going forward. Certainly, we understand the severity of this, and there will be accountability associated with it.","Paul E. Huck","And Duffy, just to close, on the growth aspect of this, the growth has been very slow in this past year for that, because of the people backing off on the purchase of these things and the stimulus actions retreating.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was looking at your balance sheet. Your payable, sequentially, went up about $300 million to $1.9 billion, and your other long-term liabilities went up about $400 million. Can you talk about what those changes are about?","Paul E. Huck","Yes -- and those things are related to Indura first, as we've brought Indura on, Jeff, for things. There's a lot of changes in the balance sheet. Indura is a big -- was a big purchase. And remember, we bring on 100%. So even -- so I bring on $900 million -- we bring on, on the total balance sheet, probably about $1.3 billion or so when you look at that, from assets and liabilities associated with that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And in terms of your minority interest line, because Indura made whatever it was, $9 million on an operating level, shouldn't the minority interest on a normal basis be much higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third if you exclude these various reversals?","Paul E. Huck","Yes. And so a thing which is getting -- which confuses this whole factor is that we had some tax adjustments, which also flow and went through that line there, which are -- there's things contained in the tax rate, and they offset in the minority interest line, which go around Indura for those things, too. But you're right, it will be larger in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I got a question on sort of the interim goals, 2015. By 2015, you said, is no longer valid. What can we expect in the interim? You're not even putting your 17% margin targets that you had achieved back in 2011. What interim goals should we expect? And is the issue here one of lack of focus? I mean, it seems the results have been somewhat inconsistent, and yet you're out making acquisitions in South America and joint ventures in the Middle East. Do you need to focus more on core operations?","John E. McGlade","Don, this is John. As I said earlier during my part of the call, we're not going to set out an interim set of goals until we have better economic clarity. Having said that, we are absolutely focused on driving improvement here. I think you have a fair question on are we not focusing on our existing business. And from my perspective, I think we are. Some of the operating issues that we had in the core businesses in Merchant and Tonnage, I believe we have our arms around. I believe we've put in the right management structures globally in these businesses. But as Paul correctly pointed out, particularly on the Merchant segment, we really need to have some economic tailwind to really be able to get the leverage out of the existing asset base that we have. If I just took, and Paul made these comments, if I just took a look at Europe in particular, in some cases, in the Packaged Gases businesses, we continue to go down after several years of slow or negative growth, or negative growth in southern Europe. And now we're seeing more of the core of Europe, if you will, also starting to slow.","Paul E. Huck","Yes, Don. And Don, think one thing here is we're going to have an Investor Day in November here in Houston. At that Investor Day, both John and I will address the path better here. It's kind of tight on the call today, and you asked a good question. It deserves a good answer from those things. But within the time constraints of today's call, it's hard for us to do. But at the Investor Day, we're going to talk some more about that and lay that out better as far as the path forward for us.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And one quick follow-up on the portfolio. You've gotten out of several non-core businesses. Does Performance Materials really fit? I mean, it's got attractive financial characteristics, but it's really a non-gases business. So is that the next leg in portfolio management?","John E. McGlade","Don, we've talked about certainly Performance Materials over the years. That business has been performing extremely well. We've restructured it. It gives us a really good insight to specific markets, and it really allows us to leverage some of their capabilities broadly across both their business and the Electronics Specialty Materials businesses. And quite frankly, their value-added approach to the market, in terms of extracting value based on the value that we bring to that customer base, is something I'd like to see more of more broadly across our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the helium situation. It looks like you've pushed out the Wyoming facility startup date from the first half to the second half of last year. And just maybe an update on what's going on there and how confident you now are that it'll be up and running before the end of next fiscal year.","Paul E. Huck","Yes, Mike. And so as far as the plant in Wyoming, understand that our plant is -- and can come online at any time. It has been ready for almost a year now. We are waiting for our crude supplier to be -- to bring his plant online. We now expect that to happen late in our fiscal 2013. We do not control that aspect of things. However, there are other things which we are attempting to do, and we continue to explore them to get better supply of helium to us, and that's going out and exploring some other places in which we can -- and access some helium for us in the future. And so we -- it is our -- it is in our forecast that our crude supply will start to pick up around quarter 2 of this year and get some improvements in that. And then quarter 3, quarter 4, perhaps seeing the plant in Wyoming come onstream in quarter 4 for us. But obviously, very important, we are doing everything we can, and including taking some actions long term -- on the longer term, because we think the growth rate of helium is going to be -- continue to be very strong.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then the other question I have is on Merchant in the U.S. and Canada. Just maybe talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics there. I think you mentioned you're losing some business to competitors. And I would just think that, given your position and given your kind of capacity utilization situation, that really, nobody should be pushing harder to get business or keep business. So why are we seeing business going to competitors?","John E. McGlade","Yes. I think, in fairness, in this business, you're constantly balancing volume with pricing and margin expansion. And so we do take a very, very customer-specific view, along with the assets that we have in a particular region and make those judgments real time each and every time. Yes, we're seeing more competitive activity there, but that isn't the lion's share of the lost business. We also are seeing some of our customers go out of business in general. Having said that, if I step up a level and talk more broadly, we have increased our new business signings significantly year-on-year, and we're getting that volume starting to come into the P&L. As we've told you over about the last year, there is typically a 3-, 4-quarter lag from when you sign business till it begins to show up in the P&L. And we've continued to redouble our efforts in terms of putting more feet on the ground and signing new businesses -- or signing on new business. And the point I was trying to make a moment ago is we have seen, year-on-year, substantial year-on-year increases in the amount of business that we've signed.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And is it fair to say we're at the 4 quarter end of the lag rather than 3 quarters in terms of those new contracts coming onstream?","John E. McGlade","Yes, I think that's a fair statement, and I think we've started to see that. I mean, it's masked, quite honestly, by some of these other issues that we've been talking about, including the argon and the helium shortfalls, and frankly, the contract modification that we addressed in the prior-year comparisons. But we are beginning to see that business come on. The other point I was making is the amount of new business we were able to sign throughout this entire fiscal year '12 was greater than our original budget and at a good trajectory from my perspective.","Paul E. Huck","Yes. Signings for '12 in the U.S. were up by double digits, so we should see this start to improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two related questions, one on productivity. I guess you've laid out -- you've done various initiatives already, you still have some ongoing. Is this it? Or do you feel that there's another tranche that can be done? Or is there like a certain percentage of the business that you could label, or a particular region that you could characterize as being subpar and in a fixed or exit kind of mode? And then the other question is as you think about longer-term growth opportunities in a slower growth environment, the natural gas -- the U.S. natural gas related to the projects like the fertilizer and chemical plants are going to be that much more attractive to your competitors. Are you worried that the pressure -- there's going to be downward pressure on returns on capital for people bidding for those very large projects in the U.S. going forward?","John E. McGlade","Okay, Laurence. Let me give a couple of thoughts, and then I'll turn it over to Paul to give you more specifics. My comments, Paul's comments are we're seeing progress in productivity. It's getting masked somewhat by the shortfalls in volume, but we also are very clear, both internally and I thought I was in my comments, that we need to do more there and that we are kicking up the resources broadly to continue to deploy our Lean Six Sigma tools and really, really focus here more on the variable cost productivity that we can deliver from the P&L. On the sort of restructuring side of things, I think we've sized the organization globally for what we anticipate the growth of the economies that we're operating in to be. We've got to execute, as we've said, on the restructuring, for example, in Europe. And we're being very, very cautious in the addition of any additional growth-related investments and resources until we see much more visibility. Why don't I stop there? We could come to your second question, but Paul, you might want to add a few comments on productivity.","Paul E. Huck","Yes, just a couple of comments, Laurence, on the productivity end. On productivity, it is never it, so you constantly strive for that. That's what we do. So we drive for absolute cost reduction. Plus, the other aspect of this is by the things which we have put in place. We've talked about this, our SAP system, our shared services, our operating service centers. We are looking to leverage our fixed cost. And so we think that there is margin improvement, which comes as we grow this company, which you don't have to add the fixed cost, which you typically would have to add to service things. So we have capabilities in those centers which we have and in those systems, which can handle a lot more. And so we think that, that's a good margin improver for us as we talk about it. And so those are the things which we focus on. And also, finally, I think with -- regarding on the restructuring, we always look to size the business appropriately. So it's going to depend upon the economy going forward for us. John?","John E. McGlade","Yes, Laurence. If I understood your question on sort of the advent of lower natural gas, let's say for now in the United States or North America, certainly, I think net-net, that's an opportunity in terms of it ought to stimulate more manufacturing growth over the longer term. It's certainly already showing up, if you will, in the chemical industries in the Gulf Coast. And there, I believe, we're very well positioned to participate. Some of you will have the opportunity obviously to see the fruits of our labor and sort of the interconnecting of the world's largest hydrogen pipeline systems. That positions us very well in syngas supply to projects like this. But I think the other thing that we've talked about many times is tonnage projects, by their nature, are discrete investments that have to meet our return goals, both from a business level point of view and be accretive to the enterprise. And so we have control, I guess, for lack of a better set of words, on our destiny as to whether or not you take a project that is subpar from a return point of view. Now I think we have a lot of competitive advantage with what we've created in the Gulf Coast, which is where a lot of these projects are going to be. And we continue to stay very focused not only on our variable cost productivity but on driving the cost of our assets and our investments down by leveraging the base that we have and leveraging the experience that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, you guys, in the past, have talked about an industrial gas world -- industry that can grow at 9% a year. And I'm just wondering, do you think there's been a secular change? Is that a little bit too aggressive? Maybe the multiplier to GDP is not what it's used to be. Or do you think we're just in the cyclical air pocket here?","John E. McGlade","So I think it's more the latter than the former. And when we've talked about those types of numbers, we did talk about that in the context of a 5%, nominally 5% global manufacturing rate. And then we obviously dissected that a little bit further by the various regions in the globe and what their level of industrial gas intensity is. Right now, we're kind of sitting with a huge dichotomy where we're seeing pretty good -- over the last couple of years, good if not above trend line growth in the Tonnage side of the businesses. At the same time, we're seeing that eroded, if you will, by a significant slowdown on the Merchant side of the businesses.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I look at your global growth that you've put in the guidance range, 2% to 4% of global growth, I think, Paul, when you went through to work out the bridge to fiscal '13, you talked about maybe 3% or 4% earnings growth from end-market growth. I would have thought that it'd be a higher number. Is there something specific that's different this time around? Or why won't you have a little bit better base growth if you think the world might grow as much as 4%?","Paul E. Huck","If you look at this, on earnings growth, I think the other thing which goes in there is the projects which we're bringing onstream are also part of that end market, for things. And so if we look at where the bulk of the growth is in industrial gases as forecasted to happen, a lot of it does get around the on-site contracts. So our new projects are going to be a larger contributor to growth than a loading is going to be to them in the near term for us right now. The loading aspect of growth, I think, comes from people starting to expand their manufacturing capabilities in, still, in places like China, in places like the U.S., for us to get that load in there. And that's been very slow. Our indications in China from a manufacturing standpoint, if we look at rail freight, if we look at electricity demand, over the past few months, it has been close to 0, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, looking at your backlog, if you look at what you will bring onstream this year and what you're looking at from a bid standpoint, will the backlog by year end be higher or lower than the current $3 billion, do you think?","John E. McGlade","I think what we were trying to say is this, we expect it probably goes a bit lower here in the near term for the points we were making, where people are, frankly, slowing down some of their decisions, particularly outside of China. The China side of gasification seems to be pretty robust still. But I think, when you look more broadly, globally, whether it be hydrogen additions on a worldwide basis, U.S. Gulf Coast basis, or steel -- oxygen-related steel investments or electronics investments, people are taking a bit of a pause, if you will, or a slowdown in committing. Now I think these are valuable projects. And I think, when people have more clarity and insight to where this world's going, they're projects then, I think, could quickly be accelerated.","Paul E. Huck","Yes, Dave. I think another thing to point out is, and I've talked about this before, is I think capital expenditure is a much better way to look at this than -- and then to look at backlog. If you look at our underlying capital expenditures this year, take out the stuff with Indura, about $2.1 billion. For next year, we're seeing it's $2 billion to $2.2 billion, so that's about flat for us going forward here, which kind of reflects a little slowing of growth here.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess, lastly on the photovoltaics, what did that business lose within Electronics in 2012 and what the restructured contracts should be nominal for next year?","Paul E. Huck","The business was about a breakeven in Electronics last year. On the Merchant side, we actually make money. We make money there.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A couple of quick questions. Could you walk us through the rationale behind the ACWA JV in Saudi Arabia and some of the key opportunities this presents?","John E. McGlade","Yes, sure. From my perspective, Saudi Arabia continues to represent, from the large tonnage side of the industrial gas business, a real opportunity. There's significant, obviously, hydrocarbon reserves there and investment, and we just felt that lining up with a partner like ACWA really gave us the right -- the ability to be effective in competing in that marketplace. And it really follows on from our strategy to be an investor in Abdullah Hashim Gases as well. Because as you well know, we really need and want to operate against an integrated gases model wherever we can. So the tonnage plant piggybacked, and then all aspects of the market. And the combination of those 2 relationships really allow us to look at that market in that context.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then another quick question just on new business trends, kind of put another way. Could you maybe touch on what sort of trends you're seeing with RFPs and how we should be thinking about any macro-related impact on those?","John E. McGlade","Yes, I think our request for quotations hasn't modified that much. What you're getting is more of a color commentary from Paul and I in projects that might have been, let's just say -- build into, and that's part of the reason we took down our '13 number for new projects, because projects that are in the capital stack are -- the onstream are slipping a quarter or 2 or 3 based on the customer's view of where the world is. I think there is a lot of uncertainty, and people will not necessarily act as quickly on their RFPs. But they're still trying to form projects, if you will, and understand their project economics. In China, the comment we were making, we hadn't seen much of a slowdown, if any, in the gasification side of things. I think we are seeing, if I contrast that to, say, hydrogen in North America, we are seeing people just delaying how and when they want to push the button to kick their project off.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, several years ago, when you addressed the chemicals portion of the portfolio strategically, I guess it was my impression that you had taken some steps to derisk and stabilize the polyurethane intermediates business, and that was part of the rationale for including it in the Tonnage segment for reporting purposes. Can you address what's changed in that business last couple of years and why you're now exiting if it's going to be $0.05 dilutive to earnings?","Paul E. Huck","Yes, Kevin. I don't think, really, our view of the business has changed at all with this. At that point in time, really a couple of years before that, we made the decision not to take the business overseas where a lot of this production is going. So we started playing an endgame strategy around it. We've put this into that segment because of the way the contracts are run in their long-term contracts. And so it fit the business model for us on those things. Now we are playing these contracts out, and so we had a chance to shut the plant down, which is trying to derisk the business further from them and make sure our customers still have their supply. And we will continue to have a profit contribution and a sales contribution from this business. But those contracts will eventually run out, and this business will go away for us.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then if I follow up, if I may, on Indura, just to your intention to acquire the remaining 35% you don't already own? And when would you expect to cross over to earnings accretion for that business?","Paul E. Huck","It's going to be accretive in quarter 1. So as we said, $0.10 a share. We're going to see accretion in quarter 1 from Indura for us. As far as our -- acquiring the other portion of this, it's held by an individual who we bought -- in the family who we bought the original, the portion which we own from. And they have a put option to us, which they can exercise anywhere from the end of the third year to the end of the fifth year.","Operator","Our final question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of silicon growth for 2013, can you give us a feel of how you expect that to sort of run out in the first half? Is it down considerable in the first half? And just trying to gauge what type of recovery we need to hit that outlook.","Paul E. Huck","Yes, I think -- Mike, I think you're right. I think quarter one and quarter 2 are going to be slower, and we're going to see upticks in quarter 3 and quarter 4. I know we said that in last year, also with those things, but we never saw the rebound in consumer electronics. We haven't seen a rebound in PCs for those things. And at some point in time, when I think the consumer starts to feel better and we get some more discretionary spending -- and in some time, on the PPC market, businesses are going to start pulling that forward also as they move -- as they see more reason to invest on things. So I do think it's a second half thing where we're going to see stronger growth in half 2 than in half 1.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in Merchant Gases for '13, underpinning your outlook, given the shortages and contract minification, what type of -- can you grow volumes next year?","Paul E. Huck","Yes. Yes, we can in Merchant Gases. Yes.","John E. McGlade","Thank you.","Paul E. Huck","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's presentation.

Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' First Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. I'm pleased to be joined today by Paul Huck, our CFO. As we announced in October, Paul will be retiring at the end of February. I'm also pleased to be joined by Scott Crocco, who will succeed Paul as CFO. Paul will review our overall Q1 results, I will review the segments and Scott will provide our outlook for Q2 and the rest of 2013.","We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website.","Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations.","Now I'll turn the call over to Paul.","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me start by saying it's been a pleasure working with all of you over the past 9 years. I will truly miss it.","Let's turn to our results for the quarter on Slide #3. Our overall earnings per share results were in the top half of our expectations. However, softer-than-expected economic growth in the U.S., a deeper contraction than expected in Europe and continued soft volumes in China and a weaker electronics market prevented volumes from growing as much as we had hoped. Despite the weaker economic environment, we continue to take actions to improve our businesses.","Pricing held firm. We are almost complete with our Europe restructuring actions, and our plants ran well. We also repurchased 5.7 million shares this quarter. We did this opportunistically when we saw the weakness in our share price in the fall. Our cash projections had us repurchasing shares later in our multiyear planning cycle. When we saw the weakness in the price, we decided to move the repurchase forward. Overall, we spent $462 million and paid an average price of $80.69 per share. We still have a little under $500 million left in our repurchase authorization.","Our cash priorities remain the same, investing in good high-return projects, increasing our dividend each year and maintaining our A bond rating. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 10% higher versus prior year, with the Indura and DA NanoMaterials acquisitions contributing 6%. On an underlying basis, sales were up 4% on higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases segment across all regions. Our Equipment and Energy segment and our Performance Materials business also posted strong year-on-year volume improvement. Not surprisingly, this was partially offset by weakness in our European Merchant and Electronics businesses.","Sequentially, overall sales declined 2%, with underlying sales down 4% on seasonally lower volumes across the Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials segments and lower activity in Equipment and Energy. Simon will provide more segment and geographic details later.","Operating income of $372 million increased 5% versus prior year and decreased 9% sequentially. Our operating margin of 14.5% was down 70 basis points versus prior year, mainly due to the impact of inventory accounting revaluation, higher pension costs and the Indura acquisition. Excluding these impacts, operating margin would have been up 50 basis points, primarily due to our European cost reduction and improved plant operating efficiencies.","This quarter, we had some larger-than-normal impacts flow through our P&L related to inventory accounting and not related to cash or inventory levels. In our year-end balance sheet, we adjust our inventory to actual costs for the year. During the year, we use standard costs for our inventory. This necessitates an adjustment at the beginning of the year to move from the previous year actual cost to our new standards.","Typically, this adjustment is not large, as the prior year actual and the new standard are usually close to one another. For example, last year, the total adjustment was $2 million favorable. This year, however, the adjustment was $10 million unfavorable due to the following actions taken to lower cost and improve our Electronics and Performance Materials business. First, we moved to in-house production for a product which we had previously purchased. Our in-house production cost is much lower, therefore, our standard cost is lower than the cost we used at the end of 2012. Second, given the slow demand, we have been able to negotiate a number of price decreases for raw materials in 2013. This also lowers our standard cost versus our cost used at year end. Both items are positive for the business but produce a current period P&L expense to reflect the adjustments to the carrying value of the inventory. As we go through the year, we should recover these expenses as the products are sold at higher margins.","Sequentially, our margins declined 120 basis points primarily due to seasonally lower volumes and higher pension costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share were both up 3% versus last year. Our return on capital employed of 11.2% was lower due to our higher capital spending, acquisition and lower asset loadings.","Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share of $1.30 increased by $0.04 versus last year. Volumes increased earnings per share by $0.12, including $0.07 from acquisitions.","Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased earnings per share by $0.03 due to higher raw material and energy prices. Net cost performance was $0.05 unfavorable. Base business costs were $0.08 positive, primarily from the impact of our European cost reduction and improved plant operating efficiencies. This was more than offset by inflation, inventory revaluation impacts and higher pension costs.","Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together were $0.02 favorable. Equity affiliate income and noncontrolling interest taken together was $0.01 higher. Interest expense was $0.02 higher due to acquisitions and our share repurchases. A higher tax rate this year reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Our tax rate guidance for the year remains unchanged at approximately 25%. And finally, lower shares outstanding contributed $0.01.","Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 14% versus prior year, driven by the Indura acquisition. Underlying sales were down 1% on 3% lower volumes and 2% positive price. Sales were down 1% sequentially, underlying sales were down 2% on 1% positive price and 3% lower volumes due to seasonality.","Merchant Gases operating income of $171 million was up 3% versus prior year and up 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.9% was down 180 basis points compared to last year but up 110 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on the benefits from our Europe cost reduction programs and profits from the Indura acquisition, partially offset by lower volumes, particularly in our Europe packaged gas business.","Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the Indura business. We continue to see solid growth in the base business and are excited about a number of small on-site opportunities that bring together Indura's local knowledge and our on-site expertise.","As we have said, given Indura's large hardgoods business, their margins are in the low double digits, about what we expected but below the Merchant segment average. For the quarter, Indura negatively impacted segment margins by about 80 basis points. Margins were also impacted by the lower volumes and higher pension costs. Versus prior quarter, we did see the expected seasonal volume weakness and higher pension costs, but improved productivity and prior quarter Indura acquisition costs improved margins.","Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In U.S.\/Canada, sales were up 2% on 1% higher volumes and 1% higher price. Liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen volumes were up on strength in chemicals, foods and metals. We continue to be successful bringing contract signings onstream, and new signings this quarter were well above prior year. Lost business this quarter was at more typical historical levels, much lower than we had been seeing recently.","Helium availability has improved since last summer, but helium volumes are still down versus prior year and below our expectations due to supply constraints. We expect to get feedstock to bring our new Wyoming facility onstream late this fiscal year and expect helium to remain tight until at least then. We are also pursuing additional global opportunities to increase our helium supply.","Argon availability improved as we worked hard to increase production and also saw softer demand. Pricing continues to be favorable led by helium, and LOX\/LIN capacity utilization remained in the low 70s.","In Europe, sales were down 6% versus last year. Underlying sales were down 4% on 5% lower volumes and 1% positive price as we continued to successfully implement increases. Currency had a negative 2% impact. LOX\/LIN volumes were stronger in U.K., Ireland and Central Europe, but weaker in Southern Europe and the Northern Continent.","Packaged gas volumes were weak across the region, and helium volumes were down on supply availability. Despite the weaker demand environment, pricing continued to be positive, up 1%, led by strength in helium. LOX\/LIN plant loadings were in the high 70s, and new contract signings were up versus last year.","In Asia, sales were up 5% versus last year. Underlying sales were up 2% on flat volumes and 2% higher price. Currency had a positive 3% effect. LOX\/LIN volumes, excluding conversions, were up 2% across the region and up 4% in China. Similar to last quarter, liquid argon volumes were down significantly on lower steel, wholesale and PV demand in China.","Packaged gas cylinder volume growth was moderated by customer profitability actions. However, we continue to see good growth in our Microbulk product line. Pricing was up 2% on strength in helium, plant loadings remain in the mid-70s and new contract signings for the quarter were up over last year and last quarter.","Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $898 million were up 11% versus last year on strong 13% volume growth. Base volumes contributed about half of the growth, with particular strength on the U.S. Gulf Coast where our new pipeline connection enabled us to support increased customer spot demand as our competitor had short-term capacity challenges.","Air Products' new projects onstream this quarter include our hydrogen plant in Detroit for Marathon and the Petrochina ASU. As we announced last quarter, we are exiting our polyurethane intermediates business and have shut down our Pasadena PUI facility. We will be reporting PUI in continuing operations as we establish a buyer-resale arrangement to serve customers through the end of their contracts, but we will help you understand the impact of changes in the PUI business.","For the quarter, sales were down less than $10 million versus prior year, and operating income was relatively flat as we gave price relief last year to a customer. For the full year, we expect PUI sales to be down about $150 million, more than we previously communicated, as one of our remaining customers is not currently operating their facility. We still expect about a negative $0.05 EPS impact for the year, unchanged from our previous guidance.","For the segment, sequentially, sales were up 6% on 4% higher volumes and a positive 4% impact of higher energy pass-through. Currency had a 1% positive impact, while PUI was negative 3%. Operating income of $138 million was up 24% versus prior year on the strong demand, better operating performance and lower maintenance spending at our facilities.","Operating income was down 2% sequentially, primarily due to the PUI business. Operating margin of 15.4% was up 160 basis points versus prior year on higher volumes and lower maintenance. Margin declined 130 basis points sequentially on lower PUI results and higher natural gas prices.","In October, we dedicated the world's largest hydrogen plant and pipeline system, stretching from the Houston Ship Channel in Texas to New Orleans, Louisiana. The new pipeline connects our Texas and Louisiana systems, creating a 600-mile pipeline with over 20 hydrogen sources, and increases the reliability and flexibility of our hydrogen supply, which is critical to our customers along the pipeline.","The pipeline helped us supply spot opportunities as we can move product as needed, as well as use the pipe capacity itself to respond more quickly to changes in demand. We also announced a new long-term hydrogen agreement with OCI Beaumont to supply approximately 25 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen from our system to OCI's integrated methanol and ammonia plant in Beaumont, Texas. In addition to these near-term and longer-term volume benefits, we also saw improved system efficiency as we can manage the system to optimize the most efficient plants.","In November, we announced an agreement to expand our syngas separation unit in Geismar, Louisiana to increase the supply of carbon monoxide, primarily for BASF's new world-scale formic acid plant in Geismar. This expansion will also provide additional hydrogen for our Gulf Coast pipeline system.","Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $549 million were up 3% versus last year, driven by the DA Nano acquisition. Underlying sales were down 1% on flat volumes and 1% lower prices. Sequentially, sales were down 11% on 11% lower volumes.","Versus prior year, Electronics sales were flat, with the DA Nano acquisition offsetting weaker materials volumes and lower equipment sales. Sales were down 15% sequentially on weaker seasonal materials volumes and significantly lower equipment sales. With the lower demand and some increase in competitive pressure, electronics materials pricing did see some negative impact but still remained relatively stable.  Silane, driven by very weak PV markets, continues to be an exception.","Performance Materials sales were up 6% versus last year as we saw strong volume growth across all 3 regions. Prices were slightly negative, but this was offset by lower raw material costs. Sequentially, PMD sales were down 4% on the expected seasonal slowdown.","Operating income of $61 million was down 22% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 340 basis points to 11.2%. Paul discussed the inventory accounting revaluation. At the segment level, we had a negative effect from inventory accounting revaluation this quarter and a positive effect in the prior year. Excluding this impact from both quarters, operating income was down $3 million or 4%, and operating margin was down 100 basis points.","x inventory, operating income was down, primarily driven by the weaker electronic materials demand and higher costs. Sequentially, operating income was down 28%, and operating margin was down 260 basis points on the lower volumes and higher costs.","In Electronics, we announced another ultra-high purity nitrogen expansion and a further extension of our pipeline in the Tainan Science Park in Taiwan. This is in addition to the new contract announced in September to expand capacity for UMC's Phase 5 to 8 expansion. The new expansion will add 2 air separation units to the system that has been successfully serving electronics customers in Tainan for over 15 years. Air Products also serves electronics customers via pipeline networks in the U.S., Korea and China.","Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $106 million were up 19% versus prior year, primarily on higher project activity across the business. Sequentially, sales were down 16%, primarily due to lower ASU project activity. Operating income of $8 million was up 15% versus prior year on the higher activity. Sequentially, income was down 53% on the lower sales and higher project development costs.","Backlog is up 25% over last year and down 14% versus last quarter as ASU bidding has slowed, while LNG project development continues to be strong. Consistent with our previous outlook, we still expect Equipment and Energy to provide a $0.05 tailwind for the full year as we expect improvement from new LNG orders starting in Q2.","Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 10, and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. From an economic perspective, we still expect modest but improving growth in FY '13, with global manufacturing at the low end of our 2% to 4% range.","In the U.S., inventory de-stocking and fiscal cliff concerns negatively impacted manufacturing in the first quarter. The pending debt ceiling and spending debates add to uncertainty, which depresses hiring and investment and lowers consumer confidence. Going forward, we expect slow but modestly improving growth, driven in part by the recovering housing market and the Fed monetary policy.","In any scenario, reduced government spending will lower 2013 growth. So overall for the year, we expect U.S.\/Canada growth to be close to the low end of our 2% to 4% range.","Europe is in a recession now, and we are forecasting slow improvement through the rest of the year. In China and throughout Asia, there were some positive signs in manufacturing in Q1 driven by stimulus spending. We expect to see the benefits of this in the second half of the year.","In electronics, industry production is weaker than last year, and fab utilization has softened. We expect this to slowly begin to recover in the second quarter.","Our full year EPS guidance is $5.70 to $5.90, up $0.05 from our previous guidance, with the positive impact of the share repurchase partially offset by the slower economic environment going forward. CapEx is expected to be about $2 billion, consistent with the more focused guidance we gave in November. And our backlog is at $2.8 billion, down slightly from last quarter, as we brought onstream a number of projects.","As we have said in the past, it is not unusual for the backlog to move around quarter-to-quarter. We still see robust bidding in the oxygen-for-gasification market in China but continue to see decisions being delayed for potential hydrogen and electronics projects.","For Q2, our EPS guidance is $1.34 to $1.39 based on the following factors: On the positive side, we expect to see improved volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment and Energy businesses; no inventory revaluation impact; the increasing positive effect of our cost-reduction programs; and a full quarter effect of our Q1 share buyback.","Partially offsetting the sequential improvement, Tonnage Gases profits are expected to decline due to seasonally higher maintenance spending and lower volumes as refineries begin taking their annual outages. We also expect reduced spot sales on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The PUI business and the impact of Lunar New Year are also expected to be headwinds.","Now let me wrap up. Overall, Q1 gives us a good start to the year, with solid execution in an uncertain economic environment. We are taking actions to control our own destiny, including efficient plant operations, cost-reduction programs, price improvement and excellent project execution. We are well positioned to grow in the long term with the size and strength of our backlog, over 80% of which is committed to long-term, on-site or pipeline contracts. We have significant leverage on our existing assets to load them as the economy recovers. And we are focused on our core business and cash priorities.","And finally, on behalf of John McGlade and the rest of Air Products, I would like to personally thank Paul for all he's done over his 33 years with Air Products, especially the last 9 as CFO. Paul hired me into the company, and I have worked either directly for him or in his organization for all of my 22 years with Air Products. While I have some big shoes to fill, I plan to approach my new role with the same integrity, transparency and passion that Paul has and to continue to focus on driving long-term profitable growth for Air Products by increasing returns and ensuring capital discipline consistent with our cash priorities.","I enjoyed the opportunity to get out and meet a number of you in December, and I look forward to getting out again very soon as we finalize the CFO transition in late February.","Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Gwen to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, 2 questions actually. On the inventory revaluation in Electronics, I know in the past there's been offsets to -- within the corporate line. Did that occur this time? And am I correct in saying or in understanding that you expect to reverse this as the year goes on? And then just secondly, how much of the European $60 million of restructuring did you get? I think you had $40 million left to come there.","M. Scott Crocco","I'll take the second, Paul, if you take the first.","Paul E. Huck","Okay, yes. On the inventory, Don, there is some offset which occurs in the -- in there, but there are impacts which occur in the Merchant area also. And those -- and that offset is really around what occurs on the LIFO accounting, and the bulk of that is offset against the Merchant area for us in this quarter. So there is a small impact there. But for the large part, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, that flowed directly through to the bottom line in the consolidated results.","M. Scott Crocco","And the second question, Don -- this is Scott. In terms of the Europe restructuring, we're on track to wrap that up by the end of the second quarter. And we saw in this quarter about a $0.03 benefit. And as we take the actions then going forward, we expect to have that step up modestly in the second quarter and then to get to a run rate of about $0.05 per quarter, $60 million or so on an annualized basis. So consistent with what we've said in the past, we would expect to see in fiscal '13 about a $0.15 favorable impact from the cost-reduction actions in Europe.","Operator","And we'll go next to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about your utilization rates in Merchant business by region? And given some low rates, is there any possibility of consolidation of merchant facilities in any region that you can do?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. Great, P.J., good question. So let me just go over the numbers that we talked about. So for the U.S.\/Canada -- and again, these are our LOX\/LIN utilization rates. So in the U.S.\/Canada, the low 70s; in the Europe, high 70s; and in Asia, in the mid-70s. And I think one of the things that as I know you know in this business, we have a very modest distribution radius for product out of these plants, perhaps 100 miles. And so in that environment, it gets very difficult to create value just by shutting down capacity. It's certainly something that we look at on an ongoing basis, but it isn't really one of our expectations for one of the big drivers going forward. We are working hard to bring load to those facilities. We're doing that in a disciplined manner relative to pricing with our applications expertise and loading up our sales teams. So as we said, that's one of our big opportunities going forward as those assets load up.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I understand that -- sorry, go ahead.","Paul E. Huck","P.J., I think the thing is, as Simon said, our pricing has been good in most regions here as we go through. And so we don't think the utilization rate is impacting pricing.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, I understand that you don't transport gases in Merchant more than 100, 200 miles. But is there a way you can do piggybacking on on-site projects and then shut down some older merchant facilities?","Simon R. Moore","So I think anytime that we have an opportunity to do that, P.J., we would absolutely take a look at that. To be honest with you, in U.S.\/Canada, there's only a modest amount of new ASU on-site opportunities. So again, we look at that every time. I just -- I guess my point is I don't think that's going to be a huge driver of the growth going forward. I think more of an opportunity is to leverage the economic recovery that we're expecting to grow the volumes.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then secondly in electronics, there was a sequential decline. How much of that was seasonal? And then you talked about equipment decline, can you just talk about how much was equipment versus gases and chemicals?","M. Scott Crocco","So P.J., this is Scott. From a sequential in electronics, it's about half between equipment and materials and heavily driven from a materials perspective from seasonality.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit more on -- you talked about electronics rebounding in your 2Q, or I assume that was your 2Q and not the calendar 2Q. What gives you the confidence in that at this point? And what signposts should we be looking for to know that that's actually happening?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. It's a good question, Vincent, thank you. I think a couple of things there. First of all, obviously, we just talked about the seasonal pattern, right, and we recognize Q1 as typically weak. We typically see improvement through the year. So I think, to some degree, you would expect a typical seasonal pattern. I think as we talked to some of our customers, that's the feedback that they're giving to us. They wouldn't be surprised to see utilization rates be a little bit soft here but then continue to improve through the back half of the year. And again, as we look at what some of our customers are talking about, they're also looking, for example, I think both Intel and TSMC have pretty robust capital spending expectations for this upcoming year of 2013, which obviously goes to one of the concepts we've been talking about, that the big, strong players in this industry are the ones who have the ability and the capacity to continue to invest in the new fabs, and those are the companies that we're the leading supplier to.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a separate follow-up to that. I believe in the 2Q guidance you gave, you were talking about sort of the annual outages in refineries as being a negative for this quarter, for your second quarter. And just help me understand, I mean, it's obviously -- there's got to be some mismatch between the size of the outages this year and last year and so forth, right, because otherwise, they're annual and there shouldn't really be a comparable issue. So what's the difference this year versus last year?","Paul E. Huck","As far as that's concerned with that, Vincent, is that in last year and this year, the outages are probably about the same from a maintenance standpoint. We had -- our plants ran better in Q1 of this year than they ran in Q1 of last year. And so we had some plant issues in Q1 of last year which we talked about at that point in time. We are over them, and so we had a very good first quarter in that. As you look at this, the high point for turnarounds is typically our quarter 2 for the refineries. There's also turns which occur in quarter 1 and quarter 3. There's not that many which occur in quarter 4, we think. So this is typically the high point for the maintenance activities which we would normally expect. The aberration was more in the prior year than in the current year.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And related to your own productivity versus the customer?","Paul E. Huck","For last year, yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When one reads accounts of Chile, there's a sense that electricity prices have really moved up. Can you give a sense of Indura's margins on a sequential or year-over-year basis and the volume growth pro forma year-over-year? How's that acquisition doing?","M. Scott Crocco","Jeff, this is Scott. The acquisition is doing very well. We're very pleased with the business that we've acquired, and we've seen all sorts of opportunities. I'll remind you, too, that this acquisition was -- we had some cost synergies, but it was heavy on -- from a growth perspective. And in the early days here, we've been able to identify several small on-site opportunities in steel and glass, and we're pursuing them. So we are very pleased with the acquisition. In terms of your question of margin, as we've said before, to be in the low teens, given that the nature of that business is more in the hardgoods. But we do see sequential growth not only from the markets that we're in, but also, as I've mentioned, from our offerings. And as we expand and identify more opportunities, both from small on-sites, as well as in the applications arena, we expect to see continued good growth. So we're very pleased with that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then your pension contribution, I think, was $320 million in the quarter. Are you...","Simon R. Moore","$230 million.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","$230 million, I misspoke. I'm sorry. Are you expecting to contribute under $300 million this year or what's your expectation?","M. Scott Crocco","Yes. So -- Scott again, Jeff, modestly up from the $230 million, won't be $300 million, $275 million or so for the year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Scott and Paul, just on the backlog, I know it does move up and down. But would you expect the backlog at year end to be higher or lower than it was at the end of Q1?","M. Scott Crocco","I would say -- so this is Scott, Dave. As you mentioned, it's lumpy, especially as we've got more larger deals, China gasification and so forth. But I would expect it to end the year about where it is now, kind of bumping along but moving sideways. Again, a lot of good opportunities that we're out there looking at.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just Europe, Scott, I know it's been under a lot of scrutiny, restructuring and management changes. Has a corner been turned in Europe? And what's the margin potential in the European Merchant business from where it is today and where can it be in 2, 3 years if filings pick up and pricing holds?","M. Scott Crocco","So from a cost perspective, as I mentioned, we're running through and almost finalized with the provision. But I also say that we're focused on additional cost reductions beyond simply people reductions. We've got a lot of initiatives going on from a supply chain perspective, as well as trying to push price. And as you saw in our results, we do have prices up. So in terms of where could it get overall, we're looking at this and trying to make substantial, continued improvement, recognizing that the economy in the short term and for some time is not going to be a big tailwind. And so we're going to continue to drive the business and do what we need to do in order to get it profitable, both from price and cost. But hopeful, again, from a volume perspective, through applications and making sure that we're going after the right customers and the right locations to drive margin improvement.","Operator","And we'll go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Let me just add my thanks to Paul for all the years you've put in. Thank you.","Paul E. Huck","Thank you.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","When you look at the Asia volumes being flat, we've seen your competitor come out this morning with bigger numbers there now. Some of that may be new start-ups. DuPont yesterday was kind of talking about 8% sales growth in Asia. To be flat seems like one of the disappointing areas of this quarter. Can you kind of talk about what you think volumes are doing in Asia and kind of how you're doing relative to the market in Asia?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. Duffy, this is Simon. Good question. And of course, I know that you know one of the big differences is, when we talk about this region, we're just talking about our Merchant business, right, and whereas other people are talking about the impact of Asia of their whole company. So for example, if you had large tonnage plants starting up in Asia, they'd be included in the other guy's Asia comments but not in ours. And I know you know that. But just if I could then focus on what we've seen in Asia, couple of different things going on. We commented that argon has been particularly soft in Asia in our Merchant business. And you have a dynamic there of some of the steel companies who own their own air separation units. Sometimes, they need a little bit of extra argon. If they're not running as hard, they actually have a little bit of extra argon to put into the marketplace. So that has impacted our wholesale demand for argon, as well as soft photovoltaics market. Again, as we said, LOX\/LIN volumes have been up x conversions about 2%. So that's a positive. Obviously, we're working hard to make that number larger. We've also seen a little bit of softness in our cylinder business in Asia. And as we commented, we've done some things to focus on the higher profitability customers, so have done a little bit of business-shedding there as well. So we do expect to see a pickup in economic activity and volume growth in the back half of our year in Asia, particularly in the Merchant business. And again, just as a reminder, we have a lot of significant asset investments in the Tonnage business that are expected to come onstream this year as well in Asia.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then the opportunity with the on-site businesses around Indura, roughly what are we talking, 2,000, 4,000, 6,000 tons per day? I mean, what's the cumulative opportunity over a 2- or 3-year period there look like?","Paul E. Huck","Yes. And Duffy, this is Paul. If you take a look at that, the thing which we're looking at are what we would call the small generated gas type of plants. So typically, most of your opportunities there are going to be under 100 tons a day, but they turn out to be a good opportunity for us, very nice things which we do. And we are finding a lot of them principally because the business was focused on packaged gas previously. And so now as we bring our applications expertise into this country, we think we're going to be able to sell a number of these plants over the next few years.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess following the sizable share repurchases in the first quarter, your net debt's up to about $5.4 billion or 2.2x to 2.3x trailing EBITDA. I guess 2 quick questions. First, how does that compare at this point to what you would consider optimal leverage? Is there room to take that higher? And related to that, did you purchase any additional shares in January? And would you care to venture any thoughts on the likely pace of execution on the remainder of the authorization?","Paul E. Huck","If you take a look at our leverage overall, right now, it's on the high side, so -- because we move the share buyback forward with those things for where we would like to run it. Now as far as buying back shares in January, no, we haven't. As far as a buyback in the future -- of this year, we would look at this from an opportunity standpoint. As you can see is that we bought the shares at a low price. If the stock does drop down, we would look at that again.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then second question if I may on Tonnage. Can you refresh us on projected start-ups in the March quarter, other projects that may be ramping if we're thinking about sequential contributions to growth?","Simon R. Moore","I'm sorry, yes. Sorry, Kevin. Yes. So we've updated our major projects slide in our package, and we do have some projects that we expect to come onstream here soon. So particularly in the second quarter, really the Yankuang project in China will come on stream. In the third quarter, we would expect to see PetroChina in China. That's, again, very exciting project, as it's the first steam methane reformer, the first hydrogen plant that's ever been outsourced by a state-owned oil company in China, so a great opportunity. And then we have some electronics projects that are expected to come onstream later in the year. So that's kind of the framework of how things look for the rest of the year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask a question on the U.S. Merchant business. You guys had taken some lumps previously on the performance there, and you mentioned that the new signings were above the prior year and that your lost customers were below prior periods and more normal. Do you have a net win when it comes to new signings versus lost business?","Simon R. Moore","Yes, we do. Yes, absolutely, Bob. And I think I would just -- for the quarter, that is absolutely the case. We had a lot more new signings, lot more new business coming onstream. Obviously, when you look at the year-on-year comparison, right, we see some of the business that was lost through the second half of last year.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a longer-term question. As we see shale gas continue to expand in the U.S. and the promise of a lot more light oil, does this diminish the hydrogen business at all? You've always talked about more heavy sour crude slates, but it looks like the U.S. market is maybe moving opposite to that. So how does that impact your business?","Paul E. Huck","As far as that is concerned, it depends where that goes. For right now, as we look at this, there's still a good amount of heavy crude which comes into the refiners, which they process. And it also gets around what sort of the product mix which they make. We've talked about this before, that as they tend to move more and more to more transportation fuels, even a light sweet crude, they wind up cracking that further down. So as the U.S. market, especially the Gulf Coast where we have a large presence, turns into more of a market for export, that -- and that's going to favor more use of hydrogen and principally, the export which is going out is diesel, which is the heaviest consumer of hydrogen in the mix.","Operator","And we'll go next to John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Alina Khaykin ","Yes. This is actually Alina Khaykin, sitting in for John. Quick question on the guidance. I believe you've raised the midpoint by a bit. So what has changed since last quarter? Is it more restructuring, is it the share repurchases or is it faster growth in some of the markets?","M. Scott Crocco","So this is Scott. If you look at the impact from the share repurchase, roughly $0.10 up from what the previous guidance was. But then given the economic situation that we're in and the environment that we saw in the first quarter, and as we talked about a decelerating momentum through the quarter, we've taken that down by about half, just given the uncertainty of the economic growth going forward. And so that's what translates into taking it up by about $0.05.","Alina Khaykin ","Okay, got it. And then on Indura, how are you progressing towards the $20 million synergy target? And could there be upside from that?","M. Scott Crocco","As I mentioned before, we're progressing very well. And again, the cost synergies are relatively modest, driven more from a corporate governance and an oversight, and we're on track there. But really, this acquisition was driven by the top line growth synergies that we can bring, marrying their local knowledge in the hardgoods business with our application knowledge and on-sites. And so, as I mentioned before, very happy with the acquisition. It's running very well, and we look forward to continue to drive top line growth in that new market.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just looking at the Tonnage business, how much of that hydrogen spot volume growth do you think is sustainable and sort of driven or supported by the pipeline? And how much of that was more temporary, driven by the competitor issues that you referenced? And can you maybe address, while you're talking about the pipeline, any surprises, pleasant or otherwise, since the pipeline has been up and running for 4 or 5 months now?","Simon R. Moore","Great. Mike, good questions. So again, if we just kind of break down the Tonnage volume growth, we said about half of that was from new projects. So obviously, that's sustainable. The other half was from base business load-up. And I think of that base business load-up, probably half of that was increased volumes in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So to be honest with you, we call them spot volumes for a reason. There was an opportunity here where customers' demand exceeded their capacity to get product from somebody else. And we were extremely pleased that the pipeline enabled us to literally move product from one region to the other, support these customers in their time of need and also create a good opportunity for us. So one of the things we talked about in our sequential guidance going forward is we wouldn't be surprised if we saw a little bit of softening of some of those spot volumes. But again, those are exactly the opportunities and exactly the reason why we invested in the pipeline. In terms of the pipeline, I think things are going very well. The team's becoming very familiar with that and emphasizing how to best utilize it. We're getting the efficiency benefits that we expected out of it. And I would say probably, since it's come onstream, I would say the volume opportunities have perhaps exceeded our expectations as well. So things are going well down there.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then just looking at the Merchant business, a couple of questions. One, how much of a headwind was helium under U.S.\/Canada Merchant volumes? And then can you give a little bit more detail on the LAR business in the U.S. and what steps you had to take in order to alleviate the supply constraints that you were facing?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. So I think as we've said a couple of times in terms of helium, but overall, as well as in the U.S.\/Canada, it was down in U.S.\/Canada. So it has a little bit of an impact on the top line. I think, overall, for the company, not much of an impact. And as we said before, given the teams out there working very hard to drive price increases, it has a very modest bottom line impact. In terms of argon, obviously, I think we talked about this at our event in November, some examples of where we're worked hard to improve the recovery of argon at certain plants and also improve the purification. So it's not one single project, it's a matter of getting a little bit more argon out of a few different locations. And again, I'd just also point out that we've seen a little bit of demand softening as well. So argon, really, I think we would say, generally speaking, was not a constraint during the quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Jeff Schnell on for Laurence. Just going back to Europe, you mentioned that Europe is in a recession. But have you seen any signs of a stabilization or conversely, are any regions within getting worse?","M. Scott Crocco","This is Scott. So we actually saw in the first quarter a deceleration and a bigger impact from the holiday slowdown. Now early on, we're just partially way through January, we have seen that turn, and we are hopeful that as we get past the holiday slowdown, that we see sequential growth not only in the second quarter, but then through the rest of the fiscal year. In our forecast, we anticipate that for the full year, we get back about even, slightly unfavorable overall from a manufacturing output in Europe.","Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then you mentioned briefly in your prepared remarks, but can you talk about which projects and regions you're seeing customers scale back on CapEx? And are you seeing an increased reluctance on behalf of these customers to sign larger contracts given the uncertainty?","Paul E. Huck","And so as far as that's concerned, we said the gasification area in China is still plowing forward, so we're seeing contracts occur there. Then if we turn to the hydrogen contracts in the U.S. and around the world and also if we turn to electronics, we are seeing customers hold back. Certainly, within the U.S., investment plans are holding back somewhat because of the uncertainty around tax rules and things like that, which are holding back things.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Gulley with BGC Financial.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","I want to talk a little bit about what's happening in Algeria. Is the unrest there hurting your ability to get helium recoveries from the facility there, and whether or not you're seeing any pressure on future LNG projects due to political uncertainty in that region?","Paul E. Huck","As far as that's concerned, Mark, we haven't seen an impact on our plants for helium in Algeria. The place where this occurs is pretty far from our plant, with that is concerned. But it's a situation which we obviously watch, and we want to be able to get people and to have the country still work and be able to ship product out. So we'll watch that. As far as the impact on future LNG projects, I don't think anyone -- I don't think the situation here is going to have a single impact here on people looking at LNG projects. They know the Middle East is a tough place to operate. They've operated there for years with these projects, so I'd still see projects going forward. The other thing is that a lot of the development on LNG right now is really occurring in the Australia area and Indonesia area.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, on the structure of the balance sheet and leverage, I do applaud your share repurchase plan and that sort of thing. But if I look at your cash flow statement, it appears as if you're having to borrow to pay the dividend, that is your free cash flow is not quite supportive of the full dividend payment. Is that something that would concern you, Scott? And how should I think about maybe the potential for future dividend increases if I'm right on my logic?","Paul E. Huck","Yes. Mark, I'll let Scott speak on this. One of the things which you got to realize here is that as we invest capital, new capital for growth, we do increase our borrowing activity. So it looks like we are going to borrow to pay a dividend. In actuality, we are leveraging our product -- our projects as they go in. We make an equity contribution and a debt investment in these things -- for those things. And so -- and that depends upon the type of project. Certainly, an on-site project, which we're seeing a lot of our projects being right now, we're putting a lot more debt against those projects for us. In general, I don't see this concerning us going forward as far as the structure of the balance sheet.","M. Scott Crocco","But just to build on that, obviously, the focus going forward is going to be expand margins and bring those projects onstream, on time and profitably, load the assets, and so looking to generate more cash out of the investments that we've made through margin expansion.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Nice start to the year, and have fun there, Paul.","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, Mike. I will.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of Tonnage, you had a nice start to the year. Any changes to the outlook for the contribution for earnings this year? Is it still the same? Is there a potential for upsides, a little bit early to tell maybe?","Paul E. Huck","Well, on Tonnage -- and they have had a good start to the year. You're right, poor thing. I think towards the top end of the range, you're going to look at that as one of the things which is going to drive us there. So perhaps as we look at the full year that -- and that we have business which is going well, and we hope is continue to go well.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second question in terms of the outlook for silicon growth, you were at mid-single digits at the beginning of your fiscal year. Any changes to that? Maybe give us a feel for how the first quarter went so we can see how that's expected to unfold as the year progresses?","M. Scott Crocco","So this is Scott. In general, no change, but we would expect it to be a little at the bottom end of that range that we gave before.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could quantify the maintenance impact this quarter. And just -- is this a factor, as you talked about before, where it was different last year than it is this year and therefore, there's the year-to-year impact as opposed to being significantly higher this quarter? Or was it just higher this quarter for some reason?","Paul E. Huck","Yes. If you take a look at that, the impact was about $0.03 a share for us versus the prior year...","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. I'm sorry, it was lower this quarter $0.03 relative to...","Paul E. Huck","In this quarter against the prior year, that's right. And as I said, it was the prior year amount of spending which we didn't expect going into the quarter 1 of last year, but we had about $0.03 a share which was favorable year-over-year.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So having said that, as we move forward, the level we're at now is a more normal level, is that what you're saying?","Paul E. Huck","No. I think as we move forward, so if we go into quarter 2, right, as we look at quarter 2, quarter 2 is going to be down in the Tonnage area because of increased maintenance, which comes about by the turnarounds. And we get -- and not only the cost impact, but we also get the volume impact of that flowing through also.","Simon R. Moore","Okay, thanks, everyone. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. Thank you very much for joining us, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, everyone.

[Operator Instructions]. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations.","Simon Moore","Thank you, Orlando. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Air Products' second quarter 2015 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release. Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in our company. First, let me introduce our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products' Executive Vice President in charge of Materials Technologies. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions.","I'm very pleased to report that Air Products delivered strong results in the second quarter of our fiscal year 2015. Despite significant currency headwinds and weaker economic growth in most of the geographies that we operate in, we delivered good improvement in our safety performance, our EBITDA margins are up 440 basis points versus last year and our earnings per share improved by 17%. This is a significant improvement versus last year and is a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of the strategic actions we have taken in the last 10 months. Our new organization is in place, it is functioning well and delivering results.","So before I go any further, I want to thank all of the talented, dedicated and committed employees of Air Products for doing such a great job. What we are presenting to you today is the result of our 20,000 employees coming to work every day committed to serve our customers and improve every aspect of our performance. Our people are the force behind our progress. I certainly consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team.","Now please turn to slide number three, our safety performance. Year-to-date, we improved our lost time injury rate by 28% and our recordable injury rate by 30%. As Scott said during the investor conference, excellence in safety requires focus, discipline, process orientation and execution. These same characteristics are required for excellence in business performance too. The improvement in our safety results which is our number one priority, is encouraging, but we need to move forward to achieve our goal of zero incidents and zero accidents.","Now please turn to slide number 4. I would like to continue to remind everybody that our goal is and will continue to be a constant and persistent effort to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.","Now please turn to slide number 5. You have heard us many times that our goal is to create value for our shareholders. To do that, we are focused on two key elements. One, responsible allocation of capital. Air Products generates a significant amount of cash. We, the management of the company, fully understand that the proper and responsible allocation of that capital is a clear element of value creation.","The second key point is that it is not enough to have a strategy. You have to be able to execute it. Strategy without execution is worthless. So we are fully committed to actually execute our five-point strategic plan.","Before I comment on our strategic plan, please go to slide number 6 which, in simple words, explains our overall management philosophy. We have shown this slide to you before, but it is important to emphasize the key points that cash is king, EPS doesn't determine the long-term value of the company, it is the share price and the importance of capital allocation in addition to reorganization.","Now please go to slide number 7. This in summary is our strategic plan. We have made several presentations explaining the details and our executives have spent a full day at our Investor Conference on March 31 describing how we are implementing this plan. I have this slide as a reference for you. All of the presentations that we have made at our Investor Day are posted on our website for your reference and I highly encourage you to take a look at them if you have not already done so.","Now please turn to slide number 8. On Monday, April 20, we announced that Air Products has had the honor and privilege of being awarded a contract to build, own and operate with our partners, ACWA, the world's largest industrial gas complex, to supply about 75,000 tons per day of industrial gases to Saudi Aramco's refinery in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. This is by far the largest contract we have ever won in our company's 75-year history.","We did have a conference call to explain this project and the details of that conference call are again on our website. We've included the highlights here for your reference and we will be happy to answer any questions about it later on. The key point that I would like to make is that the award of this project demonstrates that Air Products has the technology, people and the self-confidence to compete for the world's largest industrial gas projects.","It also demonstrates that in addition to our focus on improving our day-to-day performance, we are committed to participate and win the right growth opportunities in the energy sector, environmental sector and the emerging markets.","Now please turn to slide number 9, a summary of our quarterly results. Scott will go into the details of these numbers, but I would like to draw your attention to the significant improvement in our margins, 440 basis points, a key goal for us to become the most profitable industrial gas company in the world.","In addition, despite the significant headwinds from currency of $0.09 per share, we improved our EPS by 17% versus last year and had positive free cash flow. In particular, the Materials Technologies team, operating more and more as an independent business under Guillermo's leadership, delivered great results driven by the strong market position and focused cost and productivity efforts. We continue to be optimistic about the future of Materials Technologies.","Now please turn to slide number 10 where you can see our steady progress toward improving our EBITDA margin. We do appreciate that we still have a long ways to go to meet our stated goal of being the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, but the key fact is that we have started on our journey and we are making progress. Air Products is moving forward with the full force and support of our people. I am very proud of our entire team and optimistic and excited about our future.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details and then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will answer your questions. Scott.","Scott Crocco","Thank you very much, Seifi. Now please turn to slide 11 for a more detailed review of our Q2 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 6% as strong underlying growth of 5% was offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 5% and a lower energy pass-through impact of 6%. Volumes increased 4% primarily from strength in two areas. In Gases Asia, volume growth was driven primarily by new plants in China. And Materials Technologies again saw solid growth across all businesses. Pricing was 1% higher driven by price increases in Gases Americas, Gases Europe and Materials Technologies. We delivered operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA improved 10% and operating income improved by 15% despite the lower sales.","Versus prior year, EBITDA margin improved 440 basis points to 29.4% while our operating margin improved 340 basis points to 18.3%. This is the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. Sequentially, our margins improved primarily due to Materials Technologies and higher sales in our equipment businesses. Versus prior year, net income increased 19% and earnings per share grew by 17% and we continue to improve our return on capital employed which increased by 80 basis points versus prior year to 10.5%.","Please turn to slide 12. My presentation at our Investor Conference last month focused almost entirely on cash flow. We do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. This is consistent with the way we are focusing on running the business. As you can see, in our second quarter of 2015, distributable cash flow was up 14% and free cash flow was up $63 million as we generated higher EBITDA and spent less on maintenance capital. We are focused on optimizing maintenance capital, spending the right amount at the right time and properly supporting the base business. These improvements were more than offset by an increase in cash taxes and dividends.","From a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter to quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, we expect to continue delivering higher EBITDA due to our cost-reduction efforts and our capital expenditures should decline in the second half of the year due to project timing. We continue to work towards being free cash flow positive for fiscal year 2015.","Turning to slide 13, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q2 operating performance, I would like to spend a moment reviewing two non-GAAP items, both resulting from our organizational restructuring actions. First, our restructuring charges totaling $55 million pretax or $0.18 per share. Second, we recorded a pension settlement charge of $13 million pretax or $0.04 per share.","As I have mentioned on prior calls, we expect to see restructuring costs and pension settlement costs during FY 2015 as we continue to simplify the organization and reduce costs. Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.55 increased $0.23 or 17% versus last year. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.22.","Pricing, energy and raw material taken together contributed $0.10. Net cost performance was $0.02 unfavorable as the benefits of our cost-reduction actions were offset by higher incentive compensation costs of about $0.15 and an unfavorable impact from other income and expense of $0.04.","We have higher incentive compensation costs this year due to better expected performance versus lower incentive compensation costs last year due to worse performance. Furthermore, in Q2, we adjusted our incentive compensation for the first half of the year, so this impact this quarter reflects both Q1 and Q2. Our incentive compensation program is very well-aligned with the performance of each business unit and it encourages action and it rewards for delivering results.","Unfavorable currency translation was $0.09 as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, our currency exposure is primarily translational as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Equity affiliate income was a penny higher. Interest expense was $0.03 lower due to higher capitalized interest and lower rates. Our tax rate of 24% remained unchanged versus prior year. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning Painter","Thanks, Scott. As you heard us share at our Investor Conference last month, the industrial gas team around the world is implementing our 5 Point Plan to drive business improvement. You heard about what focus on the core means for Industrial Gases. It means building density and integrated positions on a local basis. We shared what the new organization enables. Not just how we are organized, but how the new organization enables better and faster decisions close to the action.","You heard examples from around the world of changes in behavior and decision-making driven by implementing our new culture of Safety, Simplicity, Speed and Self-confidence. You heard a number of examples of local empowered teams making changes in the way we operate plants, manage assets, deliver products, source key materials and services all to deliver improved business results. And finally, you heard how locally aligned rewards where people can see how their actions impact their pay motivates our people and reinforces teamwork.","As Scott mentioned, in most areas, we have accrued for higher bonus payouts this year compared to last year. This is great news as it shows the alignment of employer rewards and shareholder value. You can see the impact of these changes in our safety and business results. I would like to thank our people who continue to stay focused and are delivering.","Now, turning to a common question, the price of oil stayed in the $45 to $55 per barrel range during the quarter, about half the price as a year ago. As a reminder, we have very little direct exposure to Oil Exploration & Production, probably $30 million to $40 million a year of sales, but we have begun to see a few modest impacts -- some reduction in our liquid nitrogen volumes to the oilfield services market and some impact on our business to the offshore market. ","And we have seen a few customers delaying project decisions; although it is always difficult to know exactly why. But very importantly, we have not seen any drop in the underlying hydrogen demand in the Americas as our refinery customers continue to run hard.","Finally, as I'm sure you saw, we announced last week that Marie Ffolkes will be joining Air Products next month as the new President, Industrial Gases America. We are excited to welcome Marie to this position. She brings a strong track record of leadership and proven results.","With that, please turn to slide 14 for a review of our Gases Americas results. We delivered strong results this quarter as modest underlying sales growth with significant cost improvements translated into very strong margin growth versus a weak Q2 last year. Sales of $890 million were down 14% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 13%.","The price of natural gas in the Houston Ship Channel was down almost 40% to about $3 per million BTU. Currency, primarily the Chilean peso, Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar reduced our sales by 3%. Underlying sales were up 2% on higher volumes and prices. Volumes were up 1% with liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes -- up in North America; although demand was not what we expected in March. As I said, hydrogen volumes remained strong and were up versus last year on fewer customer-scheduled maintenance outages. Helium volumes were down across the region.","Sequentially, volumes were down on Latin American seasonality and lower hydrogen volumes in North America driven by customer outages. We see this as normal fluctuations in our pipeline hydrogen volumes and don't see any signs of an overall demand decline. Our refinery customers continue to operate at high levels.","Pricing was up 1% versus last year as we continue to see the positive benefit of our pricing actions. Our actions were partially mitigated by contract formula reductions for some of our liquid customers as the price of power and diesel fuel has come down. Of course, we are also seeing lower power and diesel costs. Recall that last year we incurred much higher power costs as rates spiked during the extremely cold weather in North America. Latin American pricing was strong reflecting the inflationary environment.","As you would expect, we have profit headwinds from currency and lower energy pass-through, as well as higher incentive compensation. The team was able to more than overcome these headwinds and deliver 7% EBITDA and 7% operating income growth on the benefits of our restructuring actions, lower maintenance costs, volume leverage and positive price.","Operating margin of 20.4% was up 400 basis points with about a third coming from lower energy pass-through, another third from volume and price and the rest from lower costs. EBITDA margin of 33.7% was up 640 basis points. Sequentially, profits were down on currency, lower volumes, lower natural gas prices and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by our restructuring actions.","And while we are very focused on driving cost improvements, we were pleased to announce this week that we were awarded a new project by Big River Steel to support their hot rolled steel plant in Mississippi County, Arkansas. Consistent with our strategy, our new integrated gases facility will drive density in the local area.","Now, please turn to slide 15. For the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, underlying sales and margins were essentially flat. In these market conditions, we continue to focus on cost and pricing action. Versus last year, sales of $449 million were negatively impacted by 15% from currency, primarily the euro, British pound and Polish zloty.","Energy pass-through also reduced sales by 2%. Volumes were down 1% as packaged gas and liquid bulk volumes were essentially flat while on-site volumes were down slightly on customer and planned outages. We are pleased that pricing improved by 1% in this weak economic environment.","Primarily driven by currency translation, operating income was down significantly, highlighting the need to continue to drive efficiency in Europe. We have taken actions enabled by our new organization and expect these to begin to show in the P&L through the rest of the year, but there is no question that the trading conditions in Europe continue to be challenging.","Please turn to slide 16. Gases Asia delivered another strong quarter with the combination of significant volume growth and cost focus driving margin improvement. Underlying sales were up 12% with the reported sales up 7% to $393 million due to lower energy pass-through and currency. Volumes were up 15% driven by new projects.","As Wilbur said at the Investor Conference, our large oxygen projects in China are starting up. Customers are operating their gasifiers; they are taking oxygen and we are getting paid. Overall merchant volumes were up mid-single digits in Asia. Our China liquid oxygen and nitrogen business was flat as we increased retail business while reducing wholesale volumes. We still see end-market demand growth in China, but certainly at a slower rate than a few years ago. Sequentially, volumes were up 1% despite the Lunar New Year holiday.","Pricing was down 3% as continued overcapacity in China pressures liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon pricing. I am happy to say that with Zhengyuan, onstream now in April, we have no further merchant China capacity in our backlog. EBITDA of $144 million was up 14% and the EBITDA margin of 36.7% was up 200 basis points versus last year primarily driven by the new plants and lower costs overcoming the negative price and currency impacts.","Sequentially, profits were down primarily due to currency, price and higher incentive compensation, partially mitigated by the benefits of our restructuring actions. In terms of new business in Asia, we expect to announce a new project award from a large customer this quarter.","I will close with a few words on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sale of equipment business, as well as costs associated with the industrial gas business which are not region-specific. Our sales were roughly flat with last year as ongoing project activity was about flat and currency was negative.","We had a positive impact from a contract wrap-up this quarter which we don't expect to reoccur. Our nonbusiness costs were flat versus last year as the benefit of our cost-reduction actions was offset by higher development spending. Now I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.","Guillermo Novo","Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 17. The Materials Technologies team delivered another very strong quarter with double-digit underlying sales growth, mix improvement, productivity and our cost focus driving margins to the highest level in the 2.5 years we have reported this segment. As I shared with you at the Investor Conference, we have a very strong portfolio of businesses with leading market positions. Our people are excited about our focus on Materials Technologies and are delivering both safety and business results.","Segment sales of $533 million were up 7% versus prior year. Underlying sales were up 11% on 9% volume growth and 2% positive pricing and mix. Electronic sales were up 16% on positive volume and price with strong performance from all businesses. Process Materials volumes were up on continued high memory demand. As I mentioned to you last quarter, given the tighter supply-demand dynamics, we are working hard to sign a number of multiyear supply agreements with our customers. This is a significant development for our Process Materials business and should improve stability of volumes and earnings in the future.","At the same time, we delivered positive price this quarter. Advanced Materials continues to deliver volume growth from customers operating their newest and most advanced production lines at high rates. We saw good performance from Delivery Systems; although, as I said before, we expect this to begin to decline later in the year. Sequential volumes were down on lower Lunar New Year activity, but price and mix were still positive.","Performance materials saw more of the segment currency impact as underlying sales were up 4%. Volumes were up mid-single digits on good end-market demand in all three businesses. Price and mix was slightly negative, but with lower raw material costs and greater productivity, our margins still improved. As you heard at the Investor Conference, innovation is critical to our success in Materials Technologies.","We continue to see strong results across the Advanced Materials portfolio in electronics and our non-emissive catalysts in our polyurethane business. Great examples of innovation driving business results, we are also very pleased with the progress of our innovation initiatives in the rest of our portfolio.","EBITDA of $148 million was up 27% and EBITDA margins of 27.8% were up 440 basis points versus last year. Both EBITDA and operating margins are at the highest levels in the 2.5 years we have reported this segment. These strong results are despite headwinds from currency and higher incentive compensation versus last year.","We delivered leverage on volume growth, positive price, cost margin, productivity and are beginning to see the results of our cost restructuring actions, great results from the team. We are now focused on our key priorities -- safety, quality top-line growth, margin enhancement and advancing our strategic initiatives. All of this to drive further our business improvement. Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon.","Simon Moore","Thanks, Guillermo. I'll just comment quickly on our corporate segment that consists of our LNG and helium container businesses, as well as corporate costs which are not business-specific. Sales were up this quarter as higher LNG project activity more than offset lower helium container sales.","We have seen no change to the LNG projects we are executing in our backlog. We have seen some signs of a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects. The improved profitability was driven by the higher LNG activity. Corporate costs were flat with a reduction from our cost-saving actions offset by higher incentive compensation. Now I will turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you again, Simon. Now please turn to slide number 18 for a discussion of our outlook. At this time, based on what we know today, our guidance for the next quarter is $1.55 to $1.60 per share. At midpoint, this will be an increase of 8% over previous year. As for all of fiscal year 2015, we are maintaining our guidance of $6.35 to $6.55 per share. At midpoint, this represents a 12% increase over 2014 results despite the fact that we expect almost $0.40 per share negative headwind from currency translation.","As I said last quarter, we are not going to use currency headwinds as an excuse to lower our guidance this year. We take very seriously what we have promised investors at the beginning of the year and consider it to be our job to take actions to deliver the numbers we promised rather than reducing our guidance each quarter because of currency fluctuations or economic conditions.","We also understand that our guidance implies a strong fourth quarter. But again, we expect that the accelerating benefits of our restructuring will give us the ability to deliver on this forecast. As for capital expenditure in 2015, we now expect for it to be around $1.7 billion which is at the lower end of our previous guidance. This is due to the impact of currency and also our increased focus on all capital expenditures.","We continue to enjoy a robust backlog with a high level of secure on-site pipeline projects. The backlog of $3.2 billion remains unchanged from last quarter and you can see a list of our major projects in the appendix slides. Please note that we have not included the significant project that we just won, the Jazan project, in this backlog.","In closing, I would like to say that we are totally focused on actions that we can control to deliver on the commitments that we are making here. We are executing on our improvement actions and our team is working together to achieve our goals. Once again, I would like to take a minute and thank all of the Air Products people for the outstanding job that they are doing. At the end of the day, our performance is the result of their hard work.","I'm incredibly proud of the 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees at Air Products and I certainly consider it an honor and a privilege, as I said before, to be part of this winning team. We are working hard to move Air Products forward and create value for our shareholders. Now with that, we are more than happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Matt Andrejkovics","Actually this is Matt Andrejkovics calling in for Vincent. Thanks for taking the call. The decline in the CapEx forecast, can you just elaborate on some of the delays that you are seeing?","Seifi Ghasemi","There is no delays in our CapEx forecast. The CapEx forecast is because of two reasons. Number one, we are focused on doing the right projects and the second thing is that some of the projects that we are doing are coming in under the estimate that we had before. And obviously the effect of currency. There is no delay on any projects.","Matt Andrejkovics","And then can you just comment a little bit on the volume increases in Materials Technologies and also is it possible to parse out the difference in margin improvements that you're seeing from productivity as opposed to operating leverage?","Seifi Ghasemi","I would like to turn that over to Guillermo to answer for you.","Guillermo Novo","In terms of the volume growth, we have seen -- all the segments actually saw good volume growth. In Electronics, again, the consumer side of the market is doing very well. Memory demand is high and our position with the key players that are enjoying some of the growth from mobility from the cell phone markets and other faster growing markets have been very positive to us. And we have been approving a lot of new technologies for the next generation nodes, so those ramp rates have helped us.","If you look at Performance Materials, again, it has been broad-based. Again, this is not the peak season for us. The peak season is the next two quarters for us based on weather and seasonality, but we saw robust volumes around the world, including in Europe and some of the segments that we have been focusing on given our differentiation.","We haven't disclosed the breakdown on what is driving the margins, but I can tell you everything is contributing; there is no one big hit. As I indicated at the conference call in New York, we have taken actions specifically in the last year, targeted business to drive improvement and that has given us a strong foundation. On that now, we are writing good volumes, good plant loadings, a lot of productivity initiatives at our plants to get higher capacities and yields throughout our networks. The new products that we are launching are impacting our mix, positive mix effect, so all those things are contributing to our results.","Operator","Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi.","PJ Juvekar","A couple of questions. Seifi, when you took over, you started announcing local currency price increases, but with lower energy and distribution costs, I would imagine that getting pricing is difficult, so can you just talk about the pricing dynamics that you are seeing in the marketplace?","Seifi Ghasemi","I will give you a general answer and I would like to turn it over to Corning to elaborate. But, overall, we are still getting price increases in some of the markets that we operate in because of supply\/demand and I would like to have Corning elaborate on that.","Corning Painter","So first, just to be clear, anything that is let's say related to our onsite business or our HyCo business, where there's energy in that, you see that all in pass-through. So when we report our pricing, you are really looking at our liquid products that we deliver to a customer and you are seeing that the average price has gone up and down and a little bit, so what is the trade-off of mix, it means customers with higher prices or lower prices. So that's what you see in it.","And if you think of what we referred to in North America, you are seeing there the net impact we've been able to achieve in a pure price where we simply move the price up, offset by places where, in those liquid contracts, there's a formula that takes the price down or a surcharge comes down in cases where power costs come down or diesel costs come down and that is fair. And in terms of let's say net contribution margin to us, that really holds us neutral because those costs are coming down for us at the same time.","PJ Juvekar","And my second question is on your maintenance CapEx which was down by 50% which seems like a big cut, was there something in the old CapEx number that shouldn't have been there and if you continue to produce this kind of free cash flow, when does stock buyback come in the picture? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","PJ, number one, with respect to maintenance costs, that obviously changes quarter by quarter based on the scheduled maintenance and all of that, but, in general, I would like to make a comment that the company was spending -- talk about maintenance costs, it includes the cost of trucks, new trucks, customer stations and all of that. We are running the company on the basis of making sure that all of our plants operate reliably, but we were kind of I wouldn't say as tight as we should be on maintenance costs and we are very focused on that. But I do expect that different quarters that number will go up and down. Overall, for the company, we have said that maintenance CapEx is something like $250 million to $300 million and that is the way we expect it to be.","With respect to the free cash, we've always said that if we have free cash, first of all, let's focus on having the cash and once we have the cash then the best thing that we can do to create value for our shareholders is to invest that in organic growth, new projects which are at a higher return than our cost of capital. So that is our number one priority and fortunately, we are seeing plenty of opportunities to do that whether it is on the large projects, on our HyCo projects and all of that and you have seen some examples of that already.","Now if you go beyond that, you can always increase the company's dividend and all of that before you get to buying shares. Okay, PJ?","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Berney","This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Just had a question on the energy pass-through, is the level of sensitivity that we saw this quarter versus natural gas and power costs coming down in the Gases Americas segment? Is that pretty indicative of kind of what it would be in the future if those prices were to come back up?","Corning Painter","Yes, there's nothing particularly unique on the way we did the calculation and if things reverse, you just expect a reversal of what you saw in the P&L here.","Ryan Berney","And then because it's kind of a fixed cost structure -- did you get some margin help this quarter and if so, how much versus kind of the sales line coming down?","Seifi Ghasemi","Are you referring to our HyCo business or are you referring on our business in general?","Ryan Berney","On the Gases Americas in general.","Corning Painter","So a lot of moving pieces if you look at the Gases Americas as a whole, so there is currency because we've got South America, we've got Canada, we've got the natural gas, we have the incentive, we have seasonality in Chile and all of that. And if you wash all of that out and you think about norming for volumes, I think we are in a similar range to where we have been.","Seifi Ghasemi","Okay?","Operator","Next we will hear from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Can you explain the change in the interest expense from the first to the second quarter? Did your cash interest change or is it a different accounting treatment? Why did you go down so much with your net cash balances or net debt balances not changing very much?","Seifi Ghasemi","Very good. Can I have your other questions and then we can answer them. Interest expense is one. The next one?","Jeff Zekauskas","The second one is your cash flow from operations in the first half is down $60 million, notwithstanding the earnings growth. Is that because you are putting a lot more in your pension? I don't know what you contributed in your pension in the first half of last year, the first half of this year, but why isn't the operating cash flow stronger all things being equal?","Seifi Ghasemi","Okay. Anything else?","Jeff Zekauskas","That's it.","Seifi Ghasemi","Okay, very good. I would like to obviously turn this over to Scott to go through the details for you.","Scott Crocco","So in terms of the interest, I would say the biggest driver of interest change is really driven by currency as the main item. And then in terms of free cash flow and I want to just reiterate an important point here. I mean obviously we are looking at the all-in simple free cash flow metric. We looked at a variety of other things as well, but I think the simplicity of our free cash flow metric is very key around EBITDA and then interest expense, cash taxes, maintenance and so forth.","There are some other things in terms of cash flow from operations that obviously myself and my team are looking at very closely. Things that we have that go through there for example are severance payments. As we reduce the size of the organization, we get it right-sized. We are going to have severance payments that we don't have in our simple free cash flow metric, but it obviously is something that we are managing. We are obviously managing also working capital and we've had a use of cash from a working capital perspective and we are managing that as well and trying to make improvements there.","And so there are some other things too in terms of timing of payments from equity affiliates, earnings versus dividends received and so the key point here is when we look at the free cash flow metric here for this -- the simple free cash flow metric for this quarter, we've turned positive. There's other things that are beyond that, that again the people that need to be managing this are very clearly managing it and it has been a use of cash, but we are focused on improving our working capital. Obviously, we are going to have to make the payments associated with severance, but we are looking to drive improvements in all regards.","Seifi Ghasemi","But, obviously, Jeff, as you realize, those are kind of one-time items that doesn't indicate our kind of operating rate on a steady-state basis, that's why we separate them.","Jeff Zekauskas","What was the pension change in the first half year-over-year in the funding?","Seifi Ghasemi","Scott has that number.","Scott Crocco","Overall contributions, so, again, you've got contributions and then there is the expense which is non-cash, it's on the order of a net favorable, about $30 million or so inside of that and then again inside is also -- there is the severance. The big item that we are seeing here in the second quarter associated with the cash flow that is not in the simple free cash flow metric is severance payments that we've incurred, of course, as well.","Seifi Ghasemi","The severance payment is obviously significant, Jeff, considering what we have [indiscernible].","Jeff Zekauskas","What was it?","Scott Crocco","Our severance payments here for this quarter? About $55 million or something like that.","Operator","Moving on we will hear from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","Seifi, I think you got a 440 basis points EBITDA margin improvement over the last year. You have cut the gap with Praxair in half from 7% to 3.6%. How much of this is your $600 million cost-cutting program and within that cost-cutting program, have you made any progress yet on the operational efficiencies or is it still all SG&A and functional support costs? And then a related question would be, on your volume growth, as you load up plants in the U.S., what kind of incremental margin should we expect?","Seifi Ghasemi","Okay. First of all, Don, as you say, we are 17% EPS, up versus last year despite the currency, the margin improvement of 440 basis points. All of that is related to the cost actions that we have taken. And most of that is on the first $300 million of so-called overhead cost reduction that we've been talking to you about.","We have made progress on the other $300 million, but that is still not significant enough to show in our bottom line. It will, starting at the end of this year and in 2016. So then with respect to volume growth, I would like to have Corning comment on that.","Corning Painter","So I think volume growth right now in this current economic environment we are in, looking around the world is not something we want to be counting on going forward. I think if you think about the restructuring we are doing, if we were in very high let's say economic growth, you could maybe be concerned on how you are going to keep up with it. I think if you think about the economic environment we are in really globally today, the cost actions we are taking are perfectly timed for the environment we are in.","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes, but in terms of specifically the question you had about what kind of a margin, with the volume growth, we will expect more than 50% leverage dropping more than 50% to the bottom line.","Don Carson","Corning, did your volumes grow in the U.S. and what are operating rates in your U.S. merchant system?","Corning Painter","So operating growth that we reported for the U.S. was 1% and I would say operating rates are in the high 70%s.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils Wallin","More of a bigger-picture question here. With your backlog of primarily focused on on-site and yet clearly one of your big strategic goals is to increase density, are you going to need to spend some more CapEx to improve the density side of the portfolio or how can you increase density while still keeping your CapEx relatively disciplined?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I think, first of all, you saw one example that Corning mentioned. Big River Steel is a very good example, that it would help us build density in one part. But the other thing is that please keep in mind that most of our backlog, the capital for that backlog has been mainly spent. So as we go forward, we don't need to spend $1.7 billion to support that backlog; that is already done.","Therefore, we would have plenty of cash in order to still maintain a reasonable CapEx level of expenditure, but we have plenty of cash to support our activities to increase density in different parts of the world on smaller projects which is what we are going to do. I'd like to have Corning add to that, please.","Corning Painter","I think there's a path as well with your current assets to improve your density which is simply customers who are further away. We can think about what our cost to serve them is and what the right price should be and we can think about what that is for our opportunities who are closer to us. These are things that don't change overnight, but with month after month of diligence this is something we can improve.","Nils Wallin","And then just a different question, there is some degree of change in the gasoline pool going from tier 2 to tier 3 in terms of sulfur. How much of an opportunity would you see that in for your hydrogen business?","Seifi Ghasemi","It is very difficult to quantify that right now, but obviously that would be a positive. For us to quantify that at this stage would be a challenge, but until we know more about the details, but it certainly is in the right direction.","Operator","Next we will hear from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy","With regard to atmospheric gases in the Americas, I think in your prepared remarks you'd commented that volumes were not what you expected in March and was wondering if you could elaborate on what you saw in terms of the monthly cadence and what you are seeing so far in April there?","Seifi Ghasemi","I would just like to make a general comment and I'll turn it over to Corning to elaborate on that. But fundamentally we did see a softening of the economic activity in March. I think everybody is seeing that and that seems to be continuing in April. But, Corning, you want to elaborate on that?","Corning Painter","Just to quantify it a little bit. So let's say underlying oxygen, nitrogen, argon liquid volumes we would say were up in the low to mid-single digits for the quarter as a whole and just to say the volumes in March and a little bit the March volumes in April, they are not quite as strong as one would have hoped.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. And then a second question, if I may, on incentive comp. Why did the accrual increase when the earnings outlook did not? And I guess more importantly, how much might have been brought forward into the fiscal second quarter to true-up the accrual? It sounded like you had a fairly large drag there of $0.15 and I was hoping you might help us flesh that out?","Seifi Ghasemi","I will be more than happy to explain that. You see, the incentive system that we have for 95% of our people is based on constant currency. So in constant currency, we are increased -- our estimate -- if it was the same currency, it would be telling you that we expect another -- we would be saying that our estimate for the year is $7. Therefore, we are accruing based on constant currency as an incentive for the people. And since they are -- our people are delivering ahead of the plan in constant currency; therefore, we are required by accounting rules to accrue for that because they are going to get more than the 100% in terms of bonus.","In the second quarter, when we saw that, we had to accrue for both quarters because we haven't accrued for that in the first quarter. That is why you see a big number of $0.15 which is really $45 million. So our performance at constant currency is way ahead of the plan. And as I said, 99% of our people -- I am obviously on an incentive basis on EPS because that's the right way, but if we have a plant manager somewhere where we are rewarding them, that has to be on constant currency because that's the only fair way of evaluating their performance. I hope that clears the situation.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David Manthey","Just to follow up on that last point then, we should expect that the incentive compensation, all else being equal, should come down by $20 million to $25 million next quarter?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, it depends on how our people are performing versus their plan, but obviously in the third quarter we wouldn't have a $45 million charge, sure. It would be a lot less than that.","David Manthey","Okay. And Corning made a comment, something about your liquid nitrogen, oxygen, argon being less than expected in March, I think. And the second point is you said that your hydrogen was up year-to-year on fewer shutdowns and two things. I'm wondering, first, could you address the comment on margin? Second, with the hydrogen, is there a catch-up that you can see at some point in the future when turnarounds accelerate?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, first of all I would like to confirm what Corning said for the month of March. With respect to hydrogen, please note that we are seeing actually an increase in the demand for hydrogen because it seems that the lower oil prices -- people are driving more and the refineries are running harder than ever before. We do not expect a slowdown on hydrogen. We actually expect it to be pretty robust.","Operator","John Roberts with UBS has our next question.","John Roberts","Two questions here. I think Linde reported a pretty big drop in new orders for the equipment side of its business. You obviously scored a big order in the quarter in Saudi Arabia, but you mentioned some caution by customers for lower oil prices, so maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on what your bidding backlog looks like now? And then, secondly, I think this is the first quarter we have seen the pension settlement loss. Will that get to be a relatively large number or will that be just a small number occasionally?","Seifi Ghasemi","Very good. I'll answer the first question and the second question I will have Scott answer that. On the equipment side, as you know, we do not have a very big equipment business like some of our competitors. Obviously, the award of the Jazan project is a significant boost for our equipment business, but the rest of our equipment business is not that significant; therefore, we have not seen a significant drop and I don't expect anything material there, but the Jazan project is going to be obviously a significant boost for our equipment business.","Scott Crocco","And then if I could, I will pick up the second part of the question in terms of pension and settlement. We would expect to see a little bit more going forward. It wouldn't be huge; maybe it's $10 million per quarter or so. Again, the key point here is that we are focused on rightsizing the organization for going forward and we are going to -- we will point that out, we'll non-GAAP it and we will keep moving and focus on the underlying business performance, but I would say, John, it would be in that kind of a range for the next couple of quarters.","Operator","We will now hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","Ram Sivalingam","Seifi, it's Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. A quick question for your business heads. Corning, good margin trajectory in Q2. The outlier was industrial gases; EMEA, you said margins should lift as we get through the back part of the year. Can you give sort of any insight as to how the cadence of that is going to flow through? And then for Guillermo, stellar margins, obviously, but as you think about the run rate going forward, how are you thinking about that?","Corning Painter","Okay, so let's start off then with Europe. We have taken a large number of the actions we need to take in Europe. There's always a little bit more of a delay in Europe between the action and when it shows up in the P&L, but we would expect to see a step up in both quarters for it.","Guillermo Novo","From Materials Technologies, I think we are doing well and we see opportunities for further improvement across our different businesses. We have a broad portfolio, so it is six businesses, each one is with their own dynamics. So we are very optimistic that we can continue to drive improvement moving all levers.","Ram Sivalingam","Guillermo, you are referring to sequentially from Q2 into Q3, Q4?","Guillermo Novo","Yes, if you look at sequentially, the next two quarters tend to be the stronger quarters for us from a volume perspective. So those are going to be -- they tend to be the stronger quarters that make our year.","Operator","And our last question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Just a quick one, you spoke a little bit about how Q4 outlook is implied as being a significant step up. It looks to be about a 720 annualized run rate. Over the last seven, eight years, Air Products consistently delivered annual results $0.10 to $0.20 above the prior Q4 run rate. So does that mean that your baseline for thinking about 2016 is really somewhere north of 740, 750? [Technical Difficulty] products should be more nimble. [Technical Difficulty] five, six years or are there some offsets for next year that we should be thinking about?","Seifi Ghasemi","It would be difficult for me at this stage to speculate about 2016. I'm sure you understand with all of the moving parts that there are in the world it would be difficult to do that, but the way you are doing the math, if nothing else changes that is one way of coming to some kind of numbers, but I cannot really comment on that.","Seifi Ghasemi","Okay. Well, I would just like to -- before we go away - say thanks again for your questions. Thank you for being on the call and we look forward to talking to you in the near future. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation."],"557":["Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Simon Moore","Thank you Eduardo. Good morning everyone. Welcome to Air Products third quarter 2019 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO, Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number two.","Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you Simon, and good morning to everyone. We certainly do appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to join us on this call. At Air Products, we have a great team of talented, committed, and motivated people who stay focused on serving our customers and creating value for our shareholders every single day. This team delivered yet another quarter of very strong results. I want to thank all of our 16,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.","Our quarterly adjusted earnings per share is a record $2.17 per share, 11% higher than the last year and 14% higher at constant exchange rates. This is the 21st, I would like to repeat, 21st consecutive quarter that we have reported higher results compared to the previous year. We continue to maintain our position as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.","Our EBITDA margin this quarter was a record 40%, which is 1,500 basis points higher than five years ago. We remain in an extremely strong financial and technology position with a business that generates significant cash flow. Each quarter, my confidence increases in our ability to deploy this capital into high-return industrial gas projects that will generate significant value for our shareholders while also continuing to return cash to our shareholders through our dividends.","Now, please turn to slide number three. In terms of safety, our goal has always been zero accidents and zero incidents. We are pleased that we have improved our lost time injury rate by 72% and our recordable injury rate by 31% since 2014. But none of us can be satisfied until and unless we reach zero accidents. Even one accident is too many.","Now please turn to slide number four that states our long-term goal. Five years ago, we set the goal to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We are very proud of achieving this goal and are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the years to come. Our goal has also been extended to include being the most diverse. That means we are an inclusive company that we welcome the contribution of all people.","Now turn to slide number five, which is my management philosophy that has guided me throughout my business career, that is focus on cash generation and responsible capital allocation.","Now please turn to slide number six, which is our five-point plan for moving forward. We have shared this with you many times before. In summary, we are focused on cost and productivity to maintain our industry-leading margins. We are poised for growth by expanding on our core competencies and financial strength, and we are very focused on promoting a higher purpose for the company in addition to creating value for the shareholders. We are committed to create a company where all the people feel they belong, a company where people's contribution are recognized and rewarded, a company that is committed to sustainability and environment, a company that is supportive of the communities in which we operate, a company that people want to work for where they are proud to be part of the innovative process to solve diverse energy and environmental challenges. That is our higher purpose and we are committed to that.","Now please turn to slide number seven, which shows the key milestones in our gasification strategy. Let's take the opportunity to provide an update on a few of these exciting projects. As expected, the Lu'An project continues to run very well and contribute to our results. The Jazan air separation unit got built on budget and on time with excellent safety performance. We continue to work toward financial closing of the Jazan gasifier and power project by the end of this calendar year. We are continuing our discussion with the YK Group for the very large coal to syngas project. And the Juitai project is going with expected on-stream in 2022. Building on this momentum, we just announced the completion of an asset buyback arrangement with Jinmei, a leading coal chemical company in China. We purchased two ASUs previously owned by Jinmei and entered into a long-term contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen for the customers' coal-to-clean fuel project in Shanxi province. This project is another great example of the customers' increased confidence in outsourcing their industrial gases. In addition to these announced projects, we continue to work on a number of existing gasification opportunities around the world.","Now please go to slide number eight, where you can see the results of our key profitability metrics. We remain committed to our goal of continuing to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these metrics.","And now please go to slide number nine, which is always my favorite slide and even more so this quarter. You can see our record quarterly EBITDA margin of 40.1%, up 1,500 basis points from five years ago. This is a tremendous achievement by the people of Air Products, and all of us are very proud of it.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you very much Seifi. Now please turn to slide 10 for a summary of our third quarter results. As Seifi said, our business continues to perform very well. Price was up 4%, with strong performance across the regions and products continuing the positive trend we saw last quarter. Volume added another 2%, primarily driven by new plants, including Lu'An. Sales of $2.2 billion were down 2% as the positive volume and price were more than offset by 4% negative currency and a 3% impact from a contract modification. As I mentioned on past calls, this India contract modification reduces sales but has no impact on our profits. Our underlying volume was positive but was partially offset by lower sales from the Jazan sales of equipment project as that project nears completion and from a prior year contract termination for an old fluegas desulfurization plant. Excluding Jazan, volumes grew 4% due to new plants, base business growth and acquisitions. We continue to see strong pricing in all three regions and across our merchant product lines. Our team has worked very hard to realize the value we provide to our customers and I want to thank the team for a job well done. Although unfavorable currency persisted, both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share reached new highs. EBITDA of $892 million improved 9% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 was 11% higher. EBITDA margin of over 40% is another record high up, almost 400 basis points compared to prior year, primarily from the higher price and the India contract modification. ROCE of 12.7% improved 50 basis points versus last year, primarily due to higher profits. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 8% as all three regions improved, particularly in Asia following Lunar New Year in Q2.","Please turn to slide 11. Our third quarter GAAP EPS was $2.20 and includes three one-time items which totaled a positive $0.03 per share impact. You can find more details in our press release and appendix slide. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $2.17 was up 11% or $0.22 per share. Volume, price and costs together contributed $0.24 repeating the strong operating performance from last quarter. As a reminder, the impact of price increases is shown net of the impact of variable costs, primarily variable production costs, such as power and distribution costs in our merchant business. The other cost line refers to fixed cost, such as personnel and plant maintenance costs. It increased slightly this quarter versus prior year but is less of a headwind than recent quarters. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.05 unfavorable, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and the Euro. Excluding the unfavorable currency, EPS increased $0.27 or 14% over last year. Non-operating items, including tax rate and non-operating income, combined added $0.03. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%. For the full fiscal year 2019, we expect an effective tax rate of between 19% and 20%.","Now please turn to slide 12. We continue to generate strong cash flow. During the last 12 months, we generated about $11.50 per share or over $2.5 billion of distributable cash flow. From this distributable cash flow, we paid almost $1 billion or about 40% as dividends to our shareholders and still have nearly $1.6 billion available for high return investments in our core industrial gas business. This strong cash flow enables us to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.","Slide number 13 provides an update on our capital deployment progress. As you can see, we now show almost $17 billion of investment capacity available over the five-year period from FY 2018 through FY 2022. As expected, the total capacity continues to grow as we increase EBITDA. The almost $17 billion includes about $9 billion of additional debt capacity available today, over $5 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY 2022 and almost $3 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. Today, we have a total of about $7.7 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $6.7 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent 15% and already committed well over half of our total available capacity.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you Scott. Please turn to our Asia results on slide number 14. There you can see that our business has recovered strongly following the Lunar New Year holiday and our great team in Asia delivered yet another strong set of results. We remain very positive and I like to stress very positive about our long-term growth potential as we continue to invest in this region. While there has been some modest reduction in the reported growth rate of Chinese economy, we have not seen, as I said, we have not seen any significant impact on our business. And most importantly, we have not seen any change in behavior towards Air Products from our customers or the government of China. We continue to be very optimistic about our operations in China.","For the quarter, sales were up 9% from last year with volume and price together up 15%. Volumes increased 10%, primarily driven by new projects, mostly Lu'An. As a reminder, Lu'An has started up late in quarter three of last year and continues to perform very well. Overall pricing for the region was up 5% versus last year, the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year price improvement. Price was positive across all major product lines and key countries. The strong volume and price, combined with productivity, drove higher profits and margins. EBITDA increased 24% and EBITDA margin expanded nearly 600 basis points to more than 49%, which is another record level. Sequentially, volume and EBITDA improved 8% and 12% respectively, benefiting from a strong recovery from the Lunar New Year holidays and new plant startups. In addition to the asset buyback I mentioned earlier, we have recently announced two contract awards in Korea. One from MEMC to provide industrial gases for its new 300 millimeter wafer fab and other from POSCO Chemical to supply oxygen and nitrogen for its new cathode material manufacturing complex. A great example of our team earning the confidence of important customers.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to discuss our Americas results. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you Seifi. Please turn to slide 15 for a review of Americas results. Americas pricing success continues. The 4% improvement represents our best performance in at least four years. Overall, sales were up 1% as higher price was partially offset by 1% lower energy pass-through and 2% unfavorable currency impact. Underlying volumes grew 1% but were offset by the prior year contract termination I mentioned previously. Record EBITDA of $410 million increased 7% and EBITDA margin of 43% was up 270 basis points, primarily driven by higher pricing. Sequentially, EBITDA margin improved 270 basis points or 100 basis points excluding the impact of lower energy pass-through.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?","Simon Moore","Thank you Scott. Please turn to slide 16 for a review of our EMEA results. We continue to show positive operational results despite limited economic growth. Price increased 4%, with improvement across all major products and subregions. The EMEA team has now delivered six consecutive quarters of year-on-year price improvement. Volume was up 2% primarily driven by the acquisition of a CO2 producer while base business volume remained stable as positive retail volumes were offset by lower wholesale volume sales. Sales were negatively impacted by 2% lower energy pass-through, 5% unfavorable currency and an 11% sales reduction due to the India contract change that Scott mentioned. Reported EBITDA of $190 million was up 2% and was up 7% on a constant currency basis. Reported EBITDA margin improved 520 basis points to reach a new high of over 38%. Excluding the India contract change, EBITDA margin was up about 100 basis points. Sequentially, volumes were higher on better merchant volume, including the acquisition. And although we continue to see Brexit as a potential risk to our future results, at this point we have not seen any significant negative impacts.","Now please turn to slide 17, global gases, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales and EBITDA declined due to lower project activity as we approach the successful conclusion of our Jazan ASU sale of equipment project.","Please turn to slide 18, corporate segment which includes LNG and our other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Although modest, it is great to finally see improvement in this segment with the best sales and profits in almost three years. The Golden Pass LNG project in the U.S. Gulf Coast began to contribute this quarter and we are optimistic about additional LNG orders. It is important to note that our LNG technology has been selected for several North America and international projects that are awaiting final investment decisions by our customers.","Now, I am pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you Simon. Please turn to slide number 19. As I said on our last call, five years ago I promised we would grow the company's earnings per share by at least 10% annually. As you can see, we have done better than that over the last four years and expect to exceed 10% again this year. Thanks to the great team at air products, we have delivered on our commitments. Our goal continues to be achieving a cumulative average growth rate of at least 10% in the coming years. As you all know, we continue to live in an uncertain world that we at Air Products cannot control but we definitely do have control over the actions Air products can take to succeed in a dynamic world. We have a strong, capable and flexible organization that remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promise to investors to increase earning per share by 10% per year as we move forward.","Now please turn to slide number 20. Our updated EPS guidance for fiscal year 2019 is in the range of $8.20 to $8.25. Despite currency headwinds, this guidance represents 10% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance. For quarter four of fiscal year 2019, our earnings per share guidance is $2.26 to $2.31, up 13% to 16% over last year. Our team around the world continues to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products. Our five point strategic plan will differentiate us and drive our success going forward. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation of our continued growth. We have the financial capacity, the technical position and the talent to take full advantage of our existing opportunities.","And finally, please turn to slide number 21. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance. I want to again thank all of our 16,000 people around the world for their commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together. I certainly am proud to be part of this winning team.","Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Seifi, good pricing in the quarter. I think this was, by far, one of your best pricing quarters ever. Your onsite pricing is kind of set contractually. So, I assume that merchant prices are up a lot more than what you reported here. Can you talk about what's going on there? Is it driven by utilization? And what are you seeing from competitors? Are you seeing more disciplined behavior from competitors? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning P.J. You are very right. When we report our results, we report over the whole sector including the onsite business. Obviously, the onsite business, that prices are not going up and that's half of our business. So, when we report 4% price increase, it really is about 8% or 9%. What is driving the pricing is our decision to increase prices because it's about almost eight years that we haven't really increased prices. Our costs are going up. I made a very, very public statement in February of this year that we at Air Products have decided to increase our prices to recover our costs, and we are willing to lose volume if people want to buy from somebody else. And obviously that's a free choice they have. We consciously have decided that we need to maintain our margins and we are increasing the prices. I certainly cannot and will not comment on the behavior of the other people. I mean that's up to them to comment when you ask them the question. But we certainly have made a conscious decision despite utilization rate or anything like that that we need higher prices to maintain our margins. We can't let our margins go down.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you. And then just quickly, there is U.S.-China trade war going and I know you are not directly impacted, but your customers are. And so, can you talk about what end markets where you are seeing that impact of the trade war and which markets are strong for you?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, P.J., quite frankly, we do not see that. Now maybe it is because in China, for example, more than 60% of our business is onsite business. And therefore as a result, you know, we have a lot of protection there. But overall, I mean, I know the headline says that China is slowing, but then the next line it says China grew 6.32%. I mean if that was the case in the U.S., we will be doing cartwheels. So, the Chinese economy is growing and we are seeing the benefit of that.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you very much, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our next question from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thank you very much. Do you think that Yima oxygen explosion in China will affect project activity at all in China?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, I don't think so, because I think once people investigate, they find out what the cause is and I don't want to speculate, but I don't think that is an indication of any fundamental issue with respect to processes and so on. From what we understand, the explosion was at the ASU, not at the gasification unit. No, I don't expect any impact, not at all, John.","John Roberts","Then how much was volume up in the U.S., because I assume it was probably down in Latin America at least a little, and I don't really know what Mexico did? Actually, that's equity income, so I think that probably doesn't show up in your numbers.","Seifi Ghasemi","Our volumes in Americas was up about 4% in total.","John Roberts","4%.","Seifi Ghasemi","Am I quoting the right number?","Simon Moore","So, I think what we said on the call was our underlying volumes were up 1% in the Americas offset by the prior-year contract termination.","John Roberts","Right. No, I was asking U.S. versus Latin America or North versus South?","Seifi Ghasemi","We don't usually break that down, but the economy in the U.S. is not growing that much. It's flat.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Bob Koort","Thanks. Good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning.","Bob Koort","I wanted to explore your Jinmei project, is that just the fruition of something that I think you guys had worked a couple years ago on buying back those ASUs and supplying the gasifiers. Is that the same project and now it's just getting formalized and completed?","Seifi Ghasemi","That is correct. You are absolutely right. We have been working on this project for a while, and it finally came to fruition and we are announcing it.","Bob Koort","So, I noticed you say you are going to supply by pipeline, and I think there is, I guess, a conventional view that these coal projects must be out in the middle of nowhere. So, if you are supplying by pipeline, does that mean you are utilizing other assets in the area to supply?","Seifi Ghasemi","No John. Our plant is next to their plant. It just is delivered within a pipe. That means we are not delivering liquid, but it is from our facility. ","Bob Koort","Got you. And then Jinmei is massive. Does this portend future opportunities there? Could you do as you have done with Jazan and others and eventually convert this into some potential gasification opportunity as well from an investment standpoint?","Seifi Ghasemi","Bob, obviously, that would be our ambition, yes.","Bob Koort","And if I might sneak a last one in. In Jazan, have you guys finalized your ownership structure there? The percentages?","Seifi Ghasemi","In Jazan, I think we have said that we will end up owning about 51%. But we are finalizing the contract. The numbers might change it, 1% up and down, but nothing massive, no. We will did end up owning the majority there.","Bob Koort","Great. Thank you Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We will take our next question from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.","Stephen Byrne","Yes. Thank you. Seifi, you have certainly affected a significant culture change at Air Products and just wanted to get your view on where you are at right now with respect to that process? Is there more to go on structural change? Or is it primarily, at this point, that you incentivized employees to come forward with new opportunities for improvement?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, thank you for your question. You know, obviously, I am very proud of what we have achieved but at the same time, you know with a culture change you are never done. We can always, always, always do better. But I am very, very satisfied with the progress we have made. Our results show that. And in terms of the future, I think our people are very excited about the growth opportunities that we have. And as a result, you know, we are a lot more productive. People are excited about coming to work. People are excited about working on very exciting and new projects. And we are hiring people. So that always creates a positive mood within the company. We always work on productivity but we are hiring people for our new projects and all of that. So I feel very good about the organization. We have a great team of people. But at the same time, we can always do better.","Stephen Byrne","And on gasification, you mentioned Seifi that you are still working on numerous opportunities. Just curious as to whether or not you are seeing the bidding activity increase or get more competitive, particularly since your margins in Asia have really escalated with Lu'An?","Seifi Ghasemi","We are seeing very good opportunities. We are working on new project. And in terms of the bidding activity, quite honestly we are not in a good position to answer because our customers don't necessarily tell us whom we are competing bid and how many other bidders and all of that. But overall, you know who our competitors are. There are really three people who can participate on these big projects. There are not 20. So out of the three of us, we are all focused on different parts of the world and whether all the other two are in every project that we are in, I don't know. But when we approach a customer, we try to do the best we can for them and for Air Products. And fortunately, we are fortunate, we see a lot of opportunities and I expect us to get additional orders as we move forward.","Stephen Byrne","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning. Seifi, if we can go to your favorite slide nine, you were in that band of 34% to 36% for basically 2016, 2017 and 2018. Now in the last two quarters, you have kind of broken out of that band to a much higher range. Is the last two quarters indicative of where you think the new range will be over the next several years? Or are the last two quarters more of an anomaly and will trend back towards that 34% to 36% over time?","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning Duffy. You always ask me difficult questions, but that's fair. We have been guiding you that the margins are going to be around 33% to 35%. Right now, we have delivered around 40%, 37%, 40%. So right now, if I was going to make a prediction for the future, we are going to be in a higher band. You are going to be somewhere between 38% to 40%. That is correct Duffy.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thanks. And as long as we are predicting in the future, could you give us an early peak what 2020 looks like for you guys? And maybe not business conditions, because they can change but just when you look at the projects that you have got feathered in for 2020, is that supportive of the 10% plus growth rate you are trying to get in EPS?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I said in the call twice that our goal is to improve our profitability by 10%. So I think that kind of answers your question, right. That is what we said, yes.","Duffy Fischer","Perfect. Thank you guys.","Seifi Ghasemi","Sure.","Operator","All right. We will not take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Well, what was your Asia volume growth, ex Lu'An?","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","Including Lu'An, it was about maybe 4%.","Jeff Zekauskas","About 4%, okay. And prices in the United States or prices in North America and Europe have been very good year-over-year, but pricing in Europe and in the Americas was flat sequentially and capacity utilization rates in North America and Europe have flattened out and come off. So generally speaking, has pricing in industrial gases as a base case plateaued at the current levels that we are at?","Seifi Ghasemi","I wouldn't want to say that. I expect continued price improvement at least in the next two quarters. And then after that we will see how it works out. But I think the momentum that we have will continue in the next two quarters, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead, sir.","Don Carson","Yes. Thank you. Good morning Seifi. You have been delivering strong earnings growth despite the drag from LNG. So can you remind us has that drag on earnings been in the last few years? And as your project backlog starts to improve, what sort of contribution could you see sale of the LNG equipment making over the next few years?","Seifi Ghasemi","Don, that's an excellent question. In 2015, our LNG business delivered us about $0.50 earnings per share, about $150 million of EBITDA. Last year and this year, it almost contributed nothing. So the drag has been about $0.50. So I am hoping that in time we will recover that and hopefully even improve on that.","Don Carson","Okay. And then a follow-up on your EPS contribution. You had 4% volume growth if you exclude Jazan but you show that as a $0.04 drag on EPS year-over-year. So I am trying to reconcile why volume improvement would be an EPS drag?","Seifi Ghasemi","I think Scott in the best position to answer this. Scott, please.","Scott Crocco","Sure. Hi Don, thanks for the question. I think I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. So importantly, when we look at the underlying volumes up modestly and the contribution from those volumes were good, there were a couple of things in there that I will refer to as kind of a negative mix impact, which is the timing for the Jazan project, which as we call it the sale of equipment. So the timing on revenues versus profit, year-on-year is throwing that off a little bit as well as the prior year contract termination that I mentioned in Americas. So that's why you see the difference between the EPS contribution versus the sales. But again importantly, when you peel those kind of one-off things out, the underlying volumes were up and the contribution from those volumes were positive.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We will take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning David. How are you?","David Begleiter","Well. Thank you. Just on Jazan, as we are closer to 2020, can you talk about the cadence of the earnings ramp from the JV into 2020 and 2021 earnings, either pretax basis or an EPS basis?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, David, you know, first of all, we are working on that thing and we are hoping that everything will work out and we do the financing and signing. So I just want to say, it is not a done deal yet. But if it is done, what we have said publicly is that considering what we are investing, we will see a contribution about more than $0.75 from that project when it comes on-stream. Now, once we actually get the contract signed, put all of the numbers together and all of that and we make the final announcement that this has been done, hopefully before the end of this calendar year, then we will give you better guidance in terms of the impact on 2020 and 2021 and moving forward.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just on merchant pricing, Seifi, what was the merchant price gain by region that you realized in the quarter?","Seifi Ghasemi","I would like to read the numbers. Merchant pricing was 9%, 6%, 14% and 9% total.","Scott Crocco","Yes. That was Americas, Europe and Asia in that order.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We will now take our next question from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. Thank you. So just when you are looking at the setup overall for fiscal year 2020, there are obviously a few base moving parts. Business growth, which obviously can go with the macro. Your project in Saudi Arabia, very smaller backlog projects and the initial ramp of some LNG wins. I understand if you can't quantify these buckets, but can you just comment on your confidence in terms of the line of sight that you see into these and just your general level of enthusiasm opportunity each? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Chris. I can say that I am very optimistic that we will deliver a 10% improvement over 2019. Now if the number is going to be any better, we will talk to you about that in October. But right now, sitting here, looking at what is happening in the world, we think that we should be able to improve our EPS next year by 10% versus this year. And the way we look at it is that, you know, our job, I get paid $15 million a year to come and deliver results rather than come and explain why I didn't deliver result. We are committed to improve our EPS 10% a year in the years to come. We have done that. We will find different levers to pull in order to make that happen whether it is cost reduction, price increases, new projects and all of that. So that is our commitment to the investors, that has been our commitment to the investors since five years ago and we hope to continue to deliver that, Chris.","Christopher Parkinson","Fair enough. In new materials, you have been consistently referencing an additional $6.7 billion remaining capital to deploy and you have made it very clear that you will only explore projects that are in excess of 10% returns. When you just look at the remaining backlog opportunities, which it's my understanding there is still ample, can you just comment, are the returns mostly close to that 10% level? Or is it fair to say that there is still plenty in there that would be more similar to the implied of return of Lu'An? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, you know it's very difficult to predict that, but we have said that we would be very hesitant to take any project that's less than 10% return. So hopefully all of these projects will be 10% or higher.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you Chris.","Operator","All right. We will take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning guys.","Seifi Ghasemi","Hi.","Jonas Oxgaard","You talked, well, you talked quite some time about expanding your onsite as a percentage of your total. But considering the success in your merchant business now, are you revisiting that strategy at all?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, because we are -- our merchant business, we are going to grow it as fast as we can. We are not downsizing that. But we think that our onsite will grow faster than that. So our ratio will change not because we are slowing down on the merchant business but because we think the onsite business has the potential of growing faster than the merchant.","Jonas Oxgaard","So you don't see an opportunity to double down on the merchant either?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, the merchant business, we are going to double down based on economic growth. In China, it's growing 6%. We did build new merchant plants. But if you have a situation in Europe or in the U.S. where the market is not growing then obviously we are not going to add capacity. But that we are committed to our merchant business. We will grow it as fast as we can grow it, which is basically GDP. Nobody can grow their merchant business faster than GDP. I don't care what they say. Because if they say, oh, we are going to grow faster than the other guy, that means they are going to take market share away from the other guy and that doesn't happen. Nobody can take away market share from us and vice versa. So the merchant business is going to grow with the GDP of each region and as it grows, we will invest in that. We are committed to that. We have the know-how. We have the people. But my point is that that growth is in emerging markets. It is not in the U.S. and it is not in Europe, okay.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay. That makes sense.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Seifi Ghasemi","We have time for one more question, please.","Operator","This is our last question. Please go ahead.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well it that doesn't seem that there is any other questions. So with that, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We do appreciate your interest and good questions and look forward to discussing another set of good results with you again next quarter. Have a nice summer holiday and all the best. Take care."],"384":["Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) Q2 2016 Earnings Call April 28, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Simon R.

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Simon R. Moore - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Angela. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' second quarter 2016 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release.","Seifi and Scott will talk more about the decision to exit Energy-from-Waste, which we announced a few weeks ago. The quarterly results we are sharing today and the prior-period comparisons have been restated to reflect moving the Energy-from-Waste segment to discontinued operations.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.","First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products' Executive Vice President, in charge of our Materials Technology business now called Versum. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions.","I am very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite sluggish economic growth worldwide and currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on our five-point strategic plan and delivered $1.82 per share of earnings, which is up 17% over last year and on a constant currency basis, our EPS is up 20% versus last year. Another quarter of outstanding performance is due entirely to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' talented, committed, and motivated employees around the world.","I once again want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward, so that they can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal.","Please go to slide number three, we always start our internal meetings with a discussion on safety. And I want to do the same today in our presentation to you.","Our quarter two performance in safety was better than last year and did improve relative to our disappointing first quarter performance. So I'm pleased that we are moving in the right direction. However, the only acceptable goal is zero accidents, and we have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee.","Now, please turn to slide number four, which is the restatement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident we can focus and improve our performance on the safety side.","Now, please turn to slide number five, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize it again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates.","In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.","Now, please turn to slide number six, our five-point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on our five-point strategic plan that we announced a year-and-a-half ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter and I would like to just make a few more comments. The first point of this plan was to focus on industrial gases, our core business. And therefore, divest of our non-core businesses.","In September 2015, we announced plans to spin-off our Material Technology business tax-free to our shareholders and set it up as a separate public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form 10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have since updated that and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work necessary to implement this plan. But most importantly, Guillermo and the Material Technologies team are delivering very strong results quarter after quarter.","We are on track to complete the separation of this business from our core by the end of September 2016 and will continue to evaluate whether debt and equity market conditions are favorable for a spin-off.","The second non-core business is Energy-from-Waste, Scott will take you through the details. But as a result of the decision to exit this business last month, we have taken a pre-tax charge of almost $1 billion this quarter primarily to write-down assets associated with the Energy-from-Waste business to their realizable value.","The fourth-point of our plan is the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. We have a very robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million and have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects.","We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue, and earnings growth over the next few years. Our backlog is down this quarter because we successfully brought on-stream the new hydrogen plant in Canada serving Shell and the local pipeline system there. As I have mentioned previously, I remain very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in larger scale on-site oxygen and hydrogen plants.","In the area of restructuring, the actions we took last year to eliminate unnecessary work have already reduced our overhead by $300 million a year and you're seeing the benefits of these efforts in our results. We are making great progress on our plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational savings in the next four years through self-help measures, including plant operations, distribution, sourcing and overhead costs.","Corning will share with you some examples of the great work the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million. Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward so that we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.","Now, please turn to slide number seven for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details, but I wanted to emphasize that we improved EBITDA margin by over 500 basis points versus last year, increased our earning per share by 17%, and, most importantly, our return on capital employed is now up 200 basis points to 13%.","Our restructuring actions enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwind. Also, please note that this is the seventh consecutive quarter that we have delivered double-digit earnings per share growth.","And now, if you please turn to my very favorite slide, slide number eight, you will see our progress over the last two years where we have improved our margins by 1,000 basis points. Yes, 1,000 basis points. And during this same two years timeframe, our earning per share is up 37%. This single chart is a great demonstration of how focused the Air Products team is and we are determined to continue to improve our profitability.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then, I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you very much, Seifi. For our second quarter, sales of $2.3 billion decreased 6% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 3% each. Volumes were unchanged as Gases-Asia growth continued, while other segment volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later.","Pricing rounded down to zero but was just slightly positive driven by price increases in Gases-Americas and Gases-Europe. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $797 million improved by 12%, and operating income of $532 million improved by 20% despite the lower sales.","EBITDA margin improved 560 basis points to 35.1%, while our operating margin improved 500 basis points to 23.4%. We saw margin improvements across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 40 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 460 basis points resulted primarily from the benefit of the restructuring actions we have taken and a smaller benefit from price versus raw materials.","Our actions continue to show results, and this is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. Versus prior year, net income and earnings per share grew 18% and 17%, respectively. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13% on our higher profitability. As Simon mentioned previously, Energy-from-Waste has been moved to discontinued operations and is not included in these numbers.","Now please turn to slide 10. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by about $50 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA. I want to point out that for consistency, we've restated the prior year's growth CapEx to exclude Energy-from-Waste.","As a result of the higher EBITDA and the lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $220 million this quarter and $121 million higher than last year. Just as a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.","Turning to slide number 11, we've included some additional information regarding our decision to exit the Energy-from-Waste business that we announced earlier this month. The decision to exit the business and stop efforts to startup and operate our Energy-from-Waste projects was based on continued difficulties encountered in starting up the first project. Based on extended testing and analysis completed this past quarter, significant additional time and resources would've been required to make the projects operational.","In addition, the decision allows us to execute our strategy of focusing resources on our core Industrial Gases business. As a result of this decision, the Energy-from-Waste segment has been moved to discontinued operations, and prior year information has been restated for comparison purposes.","We recorded a pre-tax charge of $946 million during fiscal Q2. This loss includes $914 million to write down the plant assets to their estimated salvage value of $20 million. The charge also includes $32 million for plant disposition and severance costs. The projects are located on leased land that requires removal of the facility. It is expected that dismantlement of the facility will be completed in fiscal 2017. As a result of removing this asset value from the denominator, ROCE increases by approximately 100 basis points. Additional exit costs estimated at $50 million to $100 million may be recorded in future periods to wind down the plant and settle the remaining purchase contracts.","We are also still evaluating an ASU built primarily to serve the Energy-from-Waste site. Its current book value is approximately $60 million and is in our Gases-EMEA segment. There is no change to our continuing operations book effective tax rate. There will be a modest cash tax benefit totaling about $75 million to $100 million that we expect to recognize over the next 10-plus years.","In terms of future uses of cash, we see a potential net cash cost of $60 million to $110 million for the various items mentioned above. However, as we've said, we are working to optimize the cash value of our investment.","Turning now to slide number 12, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q2 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.08 per share, or $19 million pre-tax. We incurred Materials Technologies' separation costs of $7 million, or $0.04 per share primarily for legal and other advisory fees.","As I mentioned last quarter, we have completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. We are now focused on the second $300 million of operational improvements. In Q2, we incurred a $9 million, or $0.03 per share charge associated with these actions. We also recorded a $3 million or $0.01 per share pension settlement charge. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.","Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.82 increased $0.26 per share, or 17% versus last year. The impact from lower volumes decreased EPS by $0.10 per share primarily due to a positive prior year contract wrap up in global gases and a lower LNG sale of equipment activity.","Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.08, primarily driven by lower raw material costs. Net cost performance was $0.36 per share favorable, primarily due to the benefit of our restructuring actions taken last year and good progress on our operational improvements. Cost performance also benefited by about $0.15 from lower incentive compensation, lower pension costs, and other income and expense. Unfavorable currency was $0.05 as many currencies besides the euro weakened against the dollar.","As a reminder for gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Equity affiliate income was unchanged. Interest expense of $0.01 was $0.01 higher primarily due to lower capitalized interest from lower capital spending.","Taxes were $0.02 unfavorable due to higher earnings. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely closer to 25%. Now, to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Thanks, Scott. Let me start by thanking the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for delivering another very strong quarter. Despite continuing currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions, each of the regional teams delivered EBITDA margins that were up more than 500 basis points.","We are focused on the things we can control, primarily driving operational productivity, and we also improved our safety performance this quarter. We have described our operational productivity opportunity as 10,000 little things, meaning we have many opportunities to act and drive improvement.","As an example, we have a large network of plants that produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon; LOX, LIN and LAR. Many of them also serve pipeline customers like steel mills. As pipeline customer demand swings and local power rates shift, the availability and cost of liquid product changes, too. We are working with third-party providers including outside distribution experts to modernize our sales and operations planning process and tools to help us to reliably serve our customers for the lowest cost every day.","With that, please turn to slide 13 for a review of our Gases-Americas' first quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on restructuring actions and self-help measures drove the significant margin expansion. Sales of $798 million were down 10% versus last year, as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 6%, and currency reduced sales by 3%.","Volumes were down 2% primarily driven by weakness in Latin America. We also continued to see lower oilfield service demand versus last year, although we'll begin to lap that decline next quarter. Steel remains weak. We haven't yet seen any improvement to speak of in our customers' operations. Although HyCO volumes were down slightly on modest customer outages, underlying demand remained strong. Pricing was up versus prior year for the sixth consecutive quarter with a key focus on recovering inflation in South America. Volumes were down sequentially primarily in South America seasonality.","Operating income of $224 million was up 23%, and EBITDA of $341 million was up 14% versus last year, as the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy pass-through. Record operating margin of 28.1% was up 770 basis points, and record EBITDA margin of 42.8% was up over 900 basis points. Lower energy pass-through, accounted for only about 100 basis points of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 670 basis points excluding lower energy pass-through.","Finally, we are pleased to bring onstream our newest 150 million standard-cubic-foot-a-day hydrogen plant located in Scotford, Northeast of Edmonton in Alberta. This new steam methane reformer provides hydrogen and steam to Shell Canada's Scotford facility and will supply hydrogen to Northwest's refinery. The plant is connected to our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline system that is also fed by two hydrogen plants in Edmonton and supplies refiners, upgraders, chemical processors and other industries. As this plant came onstream right at the end of the quarter, it did not contribute to our Q2 results.","Now please turn to slide 14. For the Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our restructuring and pricing actions more than offsetting volume weaknesses as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $420 million were down 6% due to a negative currency impact of 3% and a negative 4% impact from lower energy pass-through.","Underlying sales were up 1%, as 2% higher prices more than offset 1% lower volumes. We have not really seen much demand improvement in Europe, but continue to work hard on price increases, delivering our fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricings. Operating income of $89 million was up 26%, and EBITDA of $145 million was up 14%, as our restructuring and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes.","Record operating margin of 21.3% was up over 500 basis points, and record EBITDA margin of 34.5% was up over 600 basis points. Lower energy pass-through accounted for about 50 basis points of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 500 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through.","Please turn to slide 15, Gases-Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions drove significant margin improvement over last year. Sales of $406 million were up 3%, primarily driven by volumes up 10%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency primarily from China, Korea, and Taiwan. Overall merchant volumes were up high-single digits both across Asia and in China specifically. We continue to see the benefits of large, on-site plan projects we brought onstream over the last year, as well as an increase in energy pass-through revenue at a few of these recently started up plants. Our coal gasification customers in China continue to operate their facilities at high rates. Our plants continue to run well. And most importantly, we continue to get paid.","Pricing was down 1%, reflecting a reduced rate of decline in LOX, LIN and LAR pricing despite the substantial overcapacity in China. Operating income of $104 million was up 23%, and EBITDA of $170 million was up 18%, as our restructuring actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price. Operating margin of 25.7% was up over 400 basis points. And EBITDA margin of 41.9% was up over 500 basis points. We did see a sequential decline in profits driven by about $5 million of positive non-recurring items last quarter, currency, and the expected lower merchant volumes during the Lunar New Year. I would add that it seems that our customers' Lunar New Year outages this year were fairly typical relative to previous years, and we didn't see them taking extended outages.","I'll close with a brief comment on Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sale of equipment business, as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gas business which are not region specific.","Sales were up as we recognized about $30 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment and that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. However, we did not recognize any profits this quarter from Jazan as we are still early in the project. Costs in this segment were down, but profits were down as the prior-year quarter had a non-recurring benefit from a contract wrap-up.","Now, please turn to slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology","Thank you, Corning. The Materials Technology team delivered another strong quarter. As I shared with you during our February Versum conference call, we believe we've made structural and sustainable improvements to our business, which you can see from this graph of the margin improvement over the last three years.","This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts: innovation, focusing on our key products and markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions. While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven in part by end market changes, we do not see this as a cyclical business.","Turning to slide 17 on this quarter's results, segment sales of $490 million, were down 7% versus last year. Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems in electronics and lower additives and epoxy demand in Performance Materials. EBITDA of $150 million was up 1% and operating income of $129 million was up 4% as price\/raw material management, mix and our restructuring actions more than offset headwinds from lower volumes and currency. As a result, EBITDA margins of 30.2%, was up 240 basis points and operating margin of 26.2% was up almost 300 basis points, both representing another quarterly record.","In October, I told you that we expected to deliver higher profits in 2016 than in 2015 and we are well on our way. Through two quarters, our EBITDA is up about $20 million higher than last year. We remain confident on our outlook for 2016 and are working to continue to deliver improved profits in the second half of the year.","On slide 18, you can see the results for Electronic Materials. Sales of $234 million were down 10% on lower volumes while higher pricing offset negative currency effect. As expected, delivery systems activity was down significantly compared to high level of project activity last year. Overall Materials volumes were roughly flat as we continued to see growth in our Advanced Materials business, partially offset by weakness in our Taiwan foundry customers.","For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $83 million was down 1% and operating income of $70 million was up 4% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.5% were up over 300 basis points and operating margins of 30.1% was up 400 basis points. Pricing and mix and the benefit of our restructuring actions were the key drivers, more than offsetting currency headwinds.","On slide 19, you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $261 million were down 5% on 2% lower volumes, 2% lower prices and 1% negative currency effect. Epoxy volumes were down on weakness in oil and gas and marine coatings. Additive volumes were also impacted by oil and gas weakness, as well as mining, including a specific customer temporary site shutdown in Brazil.","We did see stronger polyurethane additives volumes across all market segments. Overall, prices were down, given broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but were more than offset by lower raw material costs.","For Performance Materials, EBITDA of $67 million was up 1% and operating income of $60 million was up 2%. EBITDA margins of 25.8% and operating margins of 22.8% were both up 160 basis points primarily driven by mix improvement and favorable price\/raw material balance.","On slide 20, you can see the updated trailing 12-month results for Materials Technology segment. Sales of over $2 billion, EBITDA of $591 million with margins of 29.3% and operating income of $504 million with margins of 25%. This is as reported within Air Products so it does not include any allocated corporate costs. As you can see, our results continue to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins.","Our team remains focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a quick comment on our Corporate segment.","Simon R. Moore - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Guillermo. Our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which are not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on lower LNG project activity. The LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancelations this quarter. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY 2016 and FY 2017 results. Profits were up despite lower sales driven by lower costs.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Simon. Now please turn to slide number 21 for a discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team is focused on implementing our five-point strategic plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earning per share of $1.87 to $1.92. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.24 or 14% over the third quarter of last year and would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit earning growth that we have delivered.","Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background but based on our strong focus on self-help measures, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2016 guidance to $7.40 to $7.55 per share. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.88, or 13% over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance and is $0.10 higher than the guidance we gave you in October. We now expect our CapEx to be about $1.2 billion for the year, down about 30% from fiscal year 2015.","As you can see from our results, we improved our free cash flow by over $120 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: number one, maintaining our A credit rating; number two, investing in good projects and accretive acquisitions; number three, continuing to increase our dividends; and number four, finally, if and only if there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks. At the end of the day, the cash that we generate belongs to the shareholders and we will only spend our cash if we have enough high return projects or good acquisitions.","And now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was curious in the margin improvement chart over the last couple of years. Can you tease out of that how much was just simply from lower electricity costs?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Probably hardly anything. Almost nothing.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","And we'll now go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just curious to how much your FX headwind has changed for the full year this quarter versus last quarter.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scott will answer the question, please.","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. Hi, Vincent. Good morning. When we came out of last quarter and we always just project currencies to stay where they were. At the end of last quarter, we would have said that for the year, FY 2016 versus prior year, our currency headwinds would have been $0.20, maybe $0.25. Now as we close this quarter and again move the currency sideways, our current view is that year-on-year, FY 2016 versus 2015, is about a $0.15 headwind. So, net-net, we've got about another $0.05 less year-on-year headwind from currency. So hopefully I was clear on that.","I'll point out also that the driver of that is all the various currencies. The euro now has mitigated a little bit, so when you look at our rules of thumb, it's also been, not only the major ones like the euro and the RMB that we've given you in the past, but also areas where we're smaller but we've seen quite a bit of movement in the currencies like the real, Korean won and Canadian dollar and so forth.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Just as a quick follow-up, could you then \u2013 if FX is about $0.05 better off to bottom, what's the balance of the guidance increase? Is it broad-based or is it coming from particular regions?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It is broad based, but it is primarily driven by our delivering the second $300 million of self-help measures that we have planned for.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you very much. Very helpful.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Vincent.","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","We will now go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Excellent job on the margins. Just on the pricing component there, you've announced a series of price increases over the past year. How would you rate the success of those price increases and what's the impact do you think going forward?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would like to have both Corning and Guillermo comment on that with their respective businesses. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yes. Thank you. So I think you can see kind of in our results the progress that we've made thus far in our pricing. We typically only announce pricing increases in North America that affect some contracts more than others. But you can see we've had broad-based success in pricing, particularly in Europe, South America as well. So if you come down to it, if you ask me, this really turns on if you go back to the concept of focus on the core. So that we focus on gases, we give the customers good service, we earn the right to raise the price increases, and we've got a self-confident and motivated team that goes out and gets it, and I see that trend continuing for us.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Guillermo?","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology","Yes. If you look at pricing in the materials space, the three big drivers that we focus on is one is value pricing. That's about technology and innovation and how we improve the overall mix of our business, and that's been going very well. Our innovation engine is doing well, and mix improvement has been a good driver of our margin improvement and growth.","I think the second driver is just competitive dynamics. Where we are in different markets, if you look at all the actions we've taken on the portfolio side and our cost actions, we are in a much more competitive position and that's allowed us to play a much more offensive game in terms of both volumes and pricing in those kinds of segments. And the last segment for us is mostly around our functional surfactants, and that's more formula-based pricing where the raw materials do have a component. So we've had a favorable lag effect as we look through that pricing overall, but all three of those areas have been performing very well for us.","Operator","Thank you...","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very good. And just last thing, Seifi, in Gases \u2013 Americas on volume, when do you think volume can turn positive in this segment? Is it Q3, is it Q4, or is it even later?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, David, the famous saying is that it's very difficult to make predictions if it is about the future. So we do not have that kind of a visibility to be able to predict that. That's why in our forecast and the guidance, we are assuming flat volumes. I don't want to venture into predicting that because we really don't know.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology","Thanks, David.","Operator","We will now go to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. Just turning back to the Industrial Gas side, can you just comment on your current expectations on industry price discipline actually particularly in Europe and then in the U.S. and whether or not you've seen any improvements over the last six to 12 months. Just any expectations going forward would be appreciated. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","So I'm sorry but no, I really cannot comment on what I think discipline would be in this industry. I could really only talk about our own actions on pricing, which I've already really shared.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Guys, you know we don't comment on pricing. It's not appropriate.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sorry. Thanks.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","We will now go to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Duffy.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Hi, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Wanted to ask a couple questions on China. They've come out and talked about the oversupply that they have in the steel industry and about potentially moving to some consolidation there. Obviously as a big supplier into that industry, are you seeing that? Do you think there's a chance that they take off meaningful capacity in steel?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Duffy, we are beginning to see that and we are seeing that people are taking it off. I'd like \u2013 Corning is closer to this thing day to day. Both of us were in China. So we can give you some comments on this. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yes. So I think, overall, our exposure to the China end-market is relatively small, our steel end-market that is. And there's really a potential upside in this. So for a long time, the CPC, the Communist Party of China, has talked about rationalizing the steel mills. And many of these smaller regional steel mills have their own captive air separation plants. They make liquid product. They basically dump that into the market space.","So more recently, there's been more serious talk out of Beijing about this, and there's been more talk of setting up funds aside to help the social transition associated with this. And I would say we begin to see that happening right now and our steel prices are now up a little bit, so we'll have to see. But, all in all, I see this as a rational and positive development.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Corning.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then, Seifi, a question for you. We've seen some noise out of the Middle East about players there wanting to raise capital, whether it's Aramco talking about potentially an IPO. One way for them to raise capital would be if they're willing to dispose of their either hydrogen plants or air separation units to a western player. Is that an opportunity for the industrial gas industry to buy assets away from the big Middle Eastern players who are trying to raise capital.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Duffy, that's an excellent question. I don't want to speak for the industry, but that is an excellent opportunity for Air Products. They have identified that as an area that we are going to be very aggressive about, and I think that would be a very positive development in our growth. That's one of the reasons we are optimistic about our growth. And as you know, we have organized ourselves now, we have a President for that part of the world. We have strengthened our team there, and we are very active in that area. Yes.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Duffy.","Operator","We will now to go Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate your unwillingness to forecast things, so I'll ask you to look far enough out that you can't be held to it. But I'm trying to get a sense; volumes have been pretty pathetic in the industry for a while here. Obviously, your earnings growth has been spectacular, mainly a function of self-help. When you get to a steady-state, what do you see as sort of the waterfall between sustainable revenue growth, EBIT growth and then ultimately EPS growth, let's say, on a three-year, five-year, seven-year or longer time horizon that takes out the near-term noise?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Bob, thanks very much for the question. I can certainly make some comments on that. Number one, you know our industry very well. I'd like to distinguish between two parts. One is our merchants and packaged gases business and our onsite business. The merchant and packaged gas businesses in this industry has always and will continue to grow with industrial production. There is no change on that. There is no change in the industry. If you are focused on packaged gases and liquids and you try to move your portfolio towards that as some of our competitors are doing, you're going to be stuck with growth with industrial production, whatever it is. So there's no change in the industry.","Where we see significant opportunities for Air Products, because that is our core competency and that is the biggest part of our portfolio, it is on the big onsite plants. And on that front, both for hydrogen and for oxygen, we see significant opportunities for growth. That is why I think for the long term, Bob, our overall goal for Air Products is to continue to grow our earnings per share 10% a year. That's our goal. And we have delivered in the last two years and that would be our goal to continue to deliver that. And we see that as a good possibility.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And could I ask maybe Scott why the CapEx number came down a little bit and the definition of your backlog? It seems like a couple of second half projects were delineated into the fourth quarter more specifically. Could you just give us an update there?","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, sure, Bob. The reason why the CapEx came down projected for this year is really just spending for the projects that we already have in the backlog. So as we project out for the year, we get close to the end of the year, what's the spending going to be for those projects, that's why we moved it down. The other thing in terms of the backlog, you'll note that we did bring on, as we mentioned, a big project up in Canada. And that's the biggest reason why our backlog has come down from $2.4 billion down to $2.1 billion.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If I may just add, the project that you're talking about in Canada is not a small project. It's about $400 million. So that has a significant effect on reducing that backlog.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Terrific. Thanks for the help.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bob.","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We will now go to John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. If you're able to reach an agreement with Evonik on Performance Materials, what would you do with Electronic Materials?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure what you're talking about. We haven't reached any agreement with anybody and I do not want to speculate about market rumors. So, sorry John, I can't comment on that.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Maybe I'll try one for Scott. Scott, now that you give us quarterly maintenance capital, is there a way that we can connect that to the EBITDA impact from maintenance? I would assume that the effect would at least be directionally similar that if you spend less CapEx in a quarter on maintenance, the EBITDA impact from the maintenance activity would probably be less.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. There is no connection there. This is Seifi.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","What we are disclosing to you is maintenance CapEx that is totally different than maintenance expense. Our maintenance expense is to upkeep our plant so that they keep running and serve our customers. We have not had any cutback on that. We are totally focused on that. The maintenance CapEx is basically a function of replacing old assets that need to be replaced, and that is what we are reporting. So there is no real connection between the two.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, John.","Operator","We will now go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Jeffrey Michael Schnell - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Jeff Schnell on for Laurence. Can you give a longer-term view of the backlog? That is do you think that this is a good run rate that will be stable over the next three to four years or should it continue to decline? And then when you look at the the biz (53:09) you're working on now, has there been any shift in regional trends?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","With respect to our projections, obviously, it depends on the projects. But we can certainly see a situation there. Our capital expenditure will be somewhere between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion a year. In terms of regions, the areas with the greatest opportunity is the United States Gulf Coast because of low natural gas and significant potential in China.","In addition to that, there is opportunities on the area that I was asked a question about in the Middle East and all of that. That's an additional opportunity. So that's where we see that. There are projects in other parts of the world, like people wanting to replace an old ASU in Europe and so on. But the major projects are definitely in China and in the U.S. Gulf Coast.","Jeffrey Michael Schnell - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","In EMEA, your underlying price is up and that was encouraging to see. Can you talk about utilization in Europe and other areas, other regions of the world?","Simon R. Moore - Vice President, Investor Relations","I'm sorry. I didn't quite sure I understood. You observed the pricing trend in Europe and your question was?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","The question was, can you talk about utilization in Europe and also in other parts of the world where the margin utilization is?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Either one of us can answer that. That's easy. It is about the same. We are still at around 77%, 78% utilization in the U.S., Europe and in China. I don't think there's any significant difference. Corning, do you want to add to that?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","No. I would just say if you're talking about where there's a little more momentum towards loading, obviously that's in China where you can see the volume movement.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then Seifi, you talked about accelerating your cost-cutting plans if the economy slowed down. And from your phase two of the cost cutting, can you talk about what is your latest thinking on that cost-cutting program and the cadence of that cost cutting? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you very much for the question. We still believe that we are on track to deliver that second $300 million in the four years. This will be the first year. Therefore, by the end of the year, we'll be at a run rate of $75 million which means that this year, we'll deliver at least $35 million, $36 million, $40 million, half of that, and we are well on our way in doing that. We are doing actually better than we thought we will be doing, and that's one of the reasons we increased our guidance for the year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Good morning.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Hi, Mike.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Corning, you mentioned that maintenance cost in the Americas was lower this quarter. How much lower was it year-on-year, and what's your expectations for Q3 and Q4 compared to this quarter?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. So, the maintenance reduction for us in this quarter was about $0.04 for us. Going forward, we're going to expect that to trend up, and that's in our forecast for the next \u2013 that we've put out for the next quarter and the full year.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then, I guess, I was a little bit surprised to hear you say that North America was still weak in terms of steel market. Are you starting to see any change with the impact of the tariffs that were put in place in the U.S.? And can you also comment on whether any change there would lead to potential loosening of supply and demand in argon supply?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. Good question. So, a couple of things. Number one, I think, it's sort of hard to talk about regional economic trends. It is so specific what's happening in one segment versus another. And even in North America steel, if you're making steel that goes into a car, you're doing great. If you're making tube, you're not doing well. So, we, in fact, have two mills that are down. I mean, they pay their BFC (57:51), but they're down.","If they were to restart, right, and the economy picked up, that would be positive. Yes, it would make more argon. But probably, in that same environment, we'd see demand for stainless steel increase. And stainless steel takes a lot of argon. So, I personally think the argon market in the U.S. is going to remain relatively tight through this transition here.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And if I can just sneak one last one in. On the equity affiliates income in Americas, it seemed to have come quite a bit lower from where it generally is. Is there a reason for that?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. We just had some maintenance in one of our equity affiliates in Americas. So that's all, it's just timing items, nothing substantive and underlying.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll now go to Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you would give us your view on the outlook for hydrogen over the next couple of years. Obviously, you're one of the biggest producers there is. With the amount of ethylene capacity coming online in the U.S. Gulf Coast that should increase hydrogen supply, but then of course there's perhaps limited refinery, limited refinery growth. So, I was just curious what your supply demand outlook is for hydrogen?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It is very positive. We see growth around the world, not just the U.S. and we are a global supplier. We are number one. We are the leader in this area. And therefore, as you see, we are bringing on big plans onstream, so we are very positive. And Corning, you want to make any additional comments?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah, maybe just to acknowledge. So even today on our large pipeline system, we have some hydrogen sources where we're off taking for a customer. And so to the extent hydrogen is available, that's an opportunity for us to bring it in. I think another reality is that a lot of this hydrogen is going to be consumed at that customer and a lot of it's going to be used for fuel value.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. And so given this positive outlook on hydrogen, would you expect that to be a greater proportion of your backlog going forward?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","I don't think that's going to significantly change the picture.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. Thanks very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. On your comments on Versum timing, you said that you're watching the credit and equity markets closely. What alternatives have you explored in case markets are unfavorable for a spin at the end of September?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would have to say just about any option that you can imagine. We have looked at everything. That's our job, to look at these options.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, Seifi, on your comments on the growth potential of industrial gases, you're very optimistic. Can you talk about the sentiment of your customers right now? Are any of them as optimistic as you are? Are they getting closer to pulling the trigger?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the customers that I'm talking about in terms of growth are the very large demand for oxygen and hydrogen. Those customers we have talked to, I told you I was just in China in the last two weeks with Corning and the rest of our people. Those customers have big plans. I'm very optimistic about what they want to do.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","We will now go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice quarter.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I wanted to include Guillermo a little bit. When you think about your volume growth here for Electronic Materials, you said it was flat ex-delivery. So are you seeing growth in all the key products of Advanced Materials, and any growth in Processed Materials as well?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","By the way, thank you for grilling him. I appreciate that. Go ahead, Guillermo.","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology","Thanks for the question. Now, if you look at our Advanced Materials, we're seeing \u2013 obviously it varies by segment. The memory market has continued to be very strong and our projections are that that is still going to continue to be a growth area for us. Volumes are holding up. Obviously that segment is getting impacted more on pricing from our \u2013 on our customer side, the pricing of DRAM and NAND, but overall volumes are still good, and we're very well-positioned with a lot of the new technologies, process of record for the next generation. So, that's doing very well.","On the Process Materials, our volumes are holding up. We've been capacity-constrained, so some of the fluctuations in the markets haven't been as big of an impact to us, although we did see a slowdown in the early part of the quarter and a pickup in the backend of the quarter because of the Taiwan earthquake and just softness in the foundry market. But we're bringing on new capacity, and as the memory market continues to grow, we expect the demand to continue.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then one long-term question is, and I think you kind of mentioned is, OEMs consider moving from 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer sometime in 2017. How much of an opportunity is that for you? What does your products do to help them move down that node?","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology","Well, two comments I would make. One is it's not just that they're going to smaller nodes and higher technology. In general, that requires new materials, new processes, and that is what's driving our formula for growth traditionally.","So that's something that has not changed. What is changing now is also that a lot of the structures are going vertical. And so you can think about if they had 25 layers before, now you have 50 layers \u2013 had 50 layers. They have 100 layers. So the amount of material used and the steps are getting much more complex, and you just use a lot more. So if you think NF3 as an example in the clean business, now you have more steps. You have more cleaning steps, demand is going up, and that's what's driven a lot of the volume growth on the material side. So from a materials perspective, the next-generation nodes, materials are going to be a much bigger driver and enabler for the newer technologies, and that's a good thing for our space.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. In general, industrial production in the United States has moved down from the fourth calendar quarter of 2015, and it keeps dropping. And Europe is a little bit different where there's some upward movement in industrial production. So, is it the case in general that your U.S. industrial gas business on the margin going into the next quarter is weakening a little bit and the European business is strengthening a little bit?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","So, it's Corning. A couple of \u2013 let me kind of speak to each one of those separately.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","I would say in the Americas, if you strip out oilfield services, you strip out steel and you try to look at the core customers, right, the customers who were with you a year ago, are they with you now? Do those customers have volume momentum? Yes, they do. And that's kind of my point. I think, it's hard to talk about a global macro statement. I think it's much more useful to think about individual segments.","In Europe, I'd say in general, it's a weak environment. It's a little hard to say in that this quarter included Easter and a year ago, it was in the third quarter. It was in April. So, I think, we're going to have to see what the actual trend turns out to be for us in Europe.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then as my follow-up, in terms of Versum, order of magnitude, is the probability that it's 75% that you'll spin it and 25% that you'll sell the individual pieces, or is there a different probability?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, you need to let me off the hook on trying to answer that question, please.

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Camille. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products second quarter 2017 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases.","After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and in today's earnings release.","Just for your information, in May, we plan to file an 8-K with the SEC that will provide revised historical annual financial statements excluding the impacts of the now separated Versum and PMD businesses. You'll recall we moved these businesses to discontinued operations starting last quarter. The updated annual statements will reflect our FY 2016 non-GAAP continuing operations EPS of $5.64 per share. We do not expect this filing to provide any new material information for investors.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered very strong performance this quarter. This is the result of the hard work and commitment of our people and their continued focus on executing our strategic Five-Point Plan. For our second quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.43, up $0.06 over last year and $0.03 above the top of our guidance range for the quarter. Please note that this is the 12th consecutive quarter that we are reporting year-on-year EPS growth.","Now please turn to slide number 3 related to our very strong safety performance. Talking about safety, I think it is appropriate at this point to take a moment to remember Mr. Ed Donley, who passed away earlier this month. Ed was Chairman of Air Products from 1978 to 1986, and CEO from 1973 to 1986. He led Air Products through some challenging times and positioned the company in several areas for the success we continue to have today. But for Ed, safety was the foundation. He emphasized that it required everyone's total commitment.","I am very pleased to say that his idea carries on. Today at Air Products, nothing is more important than the safety of our people and our safety results demonstrate this commitment and I'm very pleased with the progress that the company has made in the last few years.","Please turn to slide number 4, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.","Now please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rate. As you know, Air Products has a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company, something that I take very seriously.","I do want to take a moment and expand on the opportunities and the discipline required for the effective deployment of our cash. First, let's talk about how much capacity we do have to invest. Scott will go through the details later, but today we have about $2.5 billion of cash to invest and, in addition, we have the capacity to borrow an additional amount in the range of $2.5 billion while maintaining our targeted A and A2 rating. So, that gives us about $5 billion that we can invest today. In addition, we expect to generate over $1 billion a year in investable cash, that is after we pay taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx, and dividends.","So over the next three years, we expect to have at least an additional $3 billion and therefore a total of $8 billion to invest. We do remain confident, and I like to stress the word confident, that we can deploy the $8 billion into high return value-creating investments in our core Industrial Gases business.","Our three key areas of focus for the investments are, first, acquisition of small and medium-sized industrial gas companies. As you know, in January, we indicated our interest in acquiring Yingde Gases, a Hong Kong listed company and a major industrial gas company in China. In March, we decided that we were no longer interested in purchasing the company at this time.","This is a great example of the discipline required to effectively deploy the capital. We do our homework and then based on that homework, we decide what is the right thing to do. We are not just enamored with spending money to become bigger. We are about carefully evaluating the risk of investing and making sure we have good returns for our shareholders.","The second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from customers and create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customers based on a fixed fee. We see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category. We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units and sale of syngas to customers under long-term agreements. Essentially, these opportunities are the same as the traditional onsite business model, something that we do every day, so we are not reinventing the wheel, but with existing rather than new production assets.","And the third area of opportunity for us to invest is the very, very large industrial gas projects around the world driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy and emerging market growth. The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these projects can be. The plant that we are building in Jazan is the largest project in the history of industrial gas industry, with close to $2 billion of capital investment. Some of these new large projects could also include gasification and syngas.","So we remain optimistic we can create significant shareholder value by investing in our core Industrial Gases business. But as I have always said, if for some reason we cannot find enough good projects, we will stay disciplined and return the cash to our shareholders. We will still have the cash, and after all, it is your money. And I know everyone is very interested for us to give them a timeline for how fast we can deploy the cash. But as I said, we are not in a hurry and we will take our time to make sure that we are investing in value creating projects.","Now, please turn to slide number 6, there you can see our Five-Point Plan that continues to provide the framework for our success. We have already completed four of these steps, and we continue to work on changing the culture of Air Products by focusing on safety, simplicity, speed and self-confidence.","Now, kindly turn to page number 7, there you can see the results for our three key metrics. We remain committed to our goal to become the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these three key metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward.","Now, please turn to my favorite slide, which is slide number 8. I think it is appropriate to comment on the decline that you see on the reported EBITDA margins this quarter. First, we had a negative mix effect in our sales of equipment business. We are recognizing substantially higher sale of equipment to the Jazan joint venture in the big project we are building in Saudi Arabia, which is at lower margins than 35%. In addition, we are seeing, as mentioned last quarter, significantly lower sales of LNG equipment, which carry a higher margin than 35%.","Second, due to the higher price of natural gas, we report higher sales with no profit, since the costs are passed through to our customers. If we adjust for the effect of these factors, our underlying margins are down less than 50 basis points and is still above 35%. And even if you look at the 32.9%, I'm happy to say that we are still the most profitable industrial gas company in the world with a higher EBITDA margin than anybody else even at 32.9%.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then, as always, we will be delighted to answer your questions. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, Seifi. Now, please turn to slide 9 for a more detailed review of our Q2 results. Sales of almost $2 billion increased 11% versus last year on 7% higher volumes and 5% higher energy pass-through, slightly offset by a 1% unfavorable currency impact. Volumes were higher across Asia, North America and Europe. Latin America continues to be challenged by a weak economy.","Taken together, the industrial gas regions increased overall volumes by 2%. In our sale of equipment businesses, continued progress on our Jazan project more than offset the expected weakness in LNG. Jazan and LNG, taken together, increased volumes by 5%. Corning and Simon will provide additional comments later.","Pricing remains largely unchanged across our businesses. EBITDA of $652 million improved by 2% and operating income of $406 million improved by 4%. EBITDA margin of 32.9% and operating margin of 20.5% decreased by 300 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively. The EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by 140 basis points from higher energy pass-through costs in the Americas and EMEA, and by 120 basis points due to the different business mix in our sale of equipment businesses.","As Seifi said, our ASU sales are up significantly with the Jazan project, and our LNG sales are down significantly. LNG margins are typically higher than ASU sale of equipment margins. So, this different business mix reduces margins.","Excluding these two impacts, the underlying EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points, impacted in part by the ramp-up of zero margin utility cost pass-through in Asia and higher power and fuel costs in our liquid\/bulk business.","In addition, our productivity efforts this quarter were offset by higher maintenance costs. Sequential operating margin is down 120 basis points, 30 basis points of the decline is due to higher energy cost pass-through, while the rest is from cost, including higher maintenance expenses. Versus prior year, net income increased by 5%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 4%. ROCE of 12.3% improved by 70 basis points versus last year.","Now please turn to slide 10. You know that Air Products continues to be very focused on cash flow. Our distributable cash flow was over $300 million this quarter, while our free cash flow was negative $46 million. Free cash flow was down $156 million versus last year despite higher EBITDA, mainly due to higher cash taxes and higher maintenance capital spending due to plant replacement projects. As I've said in the past, these items move around quarter-to-quarter. And to be clear, this does not include any of the $3.8 billion we received this quarter from the sale of our PMD business.","Now turning to slide 11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I discuss our continuing operations results, I want to mention that in discontinued operations, we recorded a large $1.8 billion after-tax gain associated with the PMD divestiture that was finalized in early January.","In continuing operations, we had non-GAAP items that totaled $0.04 per share or about $14 million pre-tax for both cost actions and pension settlement costs. We expect these to continue through the year as we take further actions as part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and to offset stranded costs from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.","Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.43 increased $0.06 per share or 4% versus last year. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.08 per share. Pricing, energy and raw material taken together decreased EPS by $0.03. This was driven in part by higher power costs in our Europe business and we will be working hard to recover these costs.","Net cost performance was unchanged as our productivity actions and the TSA income were roughly offset by higher maintenance costs, inflation and cost associated with pursuing Yingde. As a reminder, included in the cost major factor is the other income (expense) line on the consolidated P&L.","As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements, or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik. The cost to provide these services are primarily are primarily in SG&A. The payment we received for these services was about $10 million this quarter, and is shown in the other income (expense) line. We would expect these TSAs to wind down in 2018, and are committed to taking actions to reduce the resulting stranded costs.","For the quarter, currency and foreign exchange gains and losses netted to a zero impact. Equity affiliate income increased by $0.01 per share. Interest expense was $0.02 higher, primarily due to lower capitalized interest as the benefit from our lower debt balance was offset by higher rates.","We've added a new line to our income statement this quarter called other non-operating income (expense). This is where we are reporting the interest income from our cash and short-term investments. Historically, interest income was a very modest amount. So, we included it in our other income (expense) line, and therefore it was in our operating income.","Since, we now have more than $3 billion in cash and short-term investments, and are generating more interest income, we've begun reporting interest income as non-operating income. Interest income contributed $0.03 this quarter. And since it is non-operating, it is not included in our EBITDA or operating income results. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 23.7%, basically unchanged from last year. We still expect our FY 2017 tax rate to be approximately 23%.","Turning to slide 12, I would also like to expand on Seifi's comments regarding our capital deployment capacity. We have about $3.3 billion of cash and short-term investments as of March 31.","After we pay the rest of the taxes due on the PMD gain and maintain a modest operating cash balance, we have about $2.5 billion of cash available to invest. Our debt balance as of March 31 is about $3.8 billion. As you know, we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A\/A2 rating. We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Based on a trailing 12 months EBITDA of $2.7 billion, this would support a debt level of about $6 billion. So in total, between available cash and additional debt capacity, we have about $5 billion we can deploy today, while maintaining our A\/A2 rating.","As Seifi mentioned, we also expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investable cash, that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx, and dividend. So, over the next three years, we see a total of over $8 billion available to invest.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. In recent quarters, we've driven our results more by productivity than by growth. In this quarter, I'm pleased to report that our commercial efforts have paid off in positive growth pretty much across the board. At the same time, I am disappointed that our underlying productivity did not fully translate to the bottom line. There are reasons for this, including higher planned maintenance this quarter, and we have a lot of cost progress behind us. But we continue to be excited by the opportunity ahead of us. There is more to come in productivity.","I would like to thank our people around the world for staying focused on our goals, notably safety, excellent customer service and our Taking the Lead productivity projects. Some examples of what we're doing right now include piloting new third-party routing software in China, introducing a new e-commerce platform for mobility, and replicating our European e-tactical planning system in North America. These actions will improve customer experience, sales, and efficiency.","Now, please turn to slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Underlying sales were up 2% but pass-through of higher energy prices, with Houston Ship Channel natural gas prices up over 50%, significantly diluted our margins. Specifically, sales of $890 million were up 12% versus last year with volume and price both up 1%, and higher energy cost pass-through up 9%. North American volumes increased Americas volumes by 1% as we saw positive volumes across almost all product lines.","Latin American volumes were down 3% versus last year, but the contribution to overall Americas volumes rounded to zero. Although not as drastic as in previous quarters, weak Latin American packaged gases demand continued. In contrast, liquid\/bulk continues to rebound on new signings and improved demand. There are no substantial new onstreams for us in Latin America in our P&L. So, the movements here are purely merchant.","EBITDA of $354 million was up 4% and operating income of $225 million was flat versus last year. EBITDA was up more than operating income, in part due to stronger equity affiliate income this year, due to higher maintenance costs at one of our joint ventures last year. Equity affiliate income impacts EBITDA but not operating income.","EBITDA and operating margins were each down about 300 basis points, with higher energy cost pass-through accounting for all the EBITDA margin movement, and 190 basis points of the operating margin movement. So, the underlying EBITDA margin was flat, and the underlying operating margin was down 90 basis points. This was primarily driven by higher maintenance costs, due to customer planned maintenance outages, more than offsetting our Take the Lead cost reduction program.","We do expect to see additional outages impacting cost during Q3. It was good to see the 1% price impact on sales, but from a margin perspective, this put us just slightly ahead of diesel and power cost increases.","Finally, we anticipate a reduction of about $70 million in North American sales in FY 2018, with the end of our supply contract for liquid\/bulk products to Airgas. As you would expect, we are working hard to replace this volume. We were pleased to be awarded an expansion of our hydrogen supply to Marathon Petroleum in Garyville, Louisiana.","We expect the new 300 million (sic) [30 million] standard cubic foot a day expansion of our existing relationship to commence later this year. The additional hydrogen will be provided from our Gulf Coast pipeline system, the world's largest hydrogen plant and pipeline network, spanning more than 600 miles from the Houston Ship Channel to New Orleans with 22 hydrogen production facilities.","Now, please turn to slide 14 for our Europe, Middle East and Africa business. Volume strengthened and profits were up on a constant currency basis. Versus last year, sales of $414 million were down 2%, with currency more than offsetting higher underlying volumes and higher energy cost pass-through.","Our volumes were up 1%, as stronger packaged gases and retail liquid\/bulk sales more than overcame lost hydrogen sales during a major planned outage. We were also very pleased to bring onstream the first phase of our new hydrogen and ASU project for BPCL in India. This first phase came onstream late in the quarter and additional phases are expected to come onstream in the third quarter. This 100% Air Products-owned facility will be reported in EMEA segment, while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in Asia equity affiliate income.","Reported pricing was flat but was positive, excluded a negative customer mix, as we began recovering the higher power cost from the first half of the year in our merchant business. Higher energy cost pass-through contributed 3% and currency had a negative 6% impact, primarily due to the British pound. Other than the continued currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote had much impact on our business this quarter. Volumes were up 2% sequentially, primarily on stronger merchant sales.","Operating income of $87 million was down 4% and EBITDA of $136 million was down 6%, but both would have been up on a constant currency basis, as our productivity actions and volume growth offset the impact from higher power costs and planned maintenance outages",".","The EBITDA margin of 32.9% was down $160 basis points, with almost two-thirds of the decrease due to higher energy pass-through, with the balance due to planned maintenance outages and higher power costs. Operating margin of 20.9% was down 40 basis points, and would have been up slightly excluding the impact of higher energy cost pass-through.","Please turn to slide 15, Gases Asia, where you can see that the strength in our merchant business and the ramp-up of our new plants continue to deliver growth. Sales of $436 million were up 7%, driven 8% by volume growth. The volume growth was roughly 50-50 split between underlying sales growth and utility pass-through volume, as our onsite customers ramp up their gasifiers.","Our merchant business was up mid to high single-digits across Asia, and our China LOX\/LIN business was up high single-digits, with particular strength in the retail portion of the business. Sequential volumes were down slightly on Lunar New Year seasonality.","Overall, China pricing was flat, as helium price headwinds were offset by positive pricing for other products. China LOX\/LIN pricing was again slightly positive versus prior year. Operating income of $112 million was up 7%, and EBITDA of $174 million was up 2%. Equity affiliate income was down due to a one-time benefit last year associated with exiting a small joint venture. This impacts EBITDA but not operating income.","Operating margin of 25.7% was flat versus last year, as the increased utility pass-through volume, which is by definition at zero margin, diluted the increased operating income. Similarly, the EBITDA margin of 40% was down 200 basis points versus last year, due to the utility pass-through volume dilution impact and the lower equity affiliate income.","We continue to successfully execute projects throughout Asia. In China, we recently brought on stream two plants. The first in Guangdong, supports a leading supplier to the high-tech display industry; the second supplies Chongqing HKC Optoelectronics, who are building China's leading LCD panel fab in western China. Both of these are examples of how we are positioned to win in China's push for high-end manufacturing for the 13th Five-Year Plan and the Made in China 2025 strategy.","In Korea, we were pleased to bring on stream the first phase of our facilities, which supply a new semiconductor fab in Pyeongtaek. This past January, we announced the second phase to support increased demand of the same customer.","Our business in India continues to show strong results. To support the strong demand growth, we have announced last week that our INOX Air Products equity joint venture will build six new plants to serve the onsite and merchant business. These investments will further strengthen our leadership position in India's merchant industrial gases market.","Finally, please turn to slide 16 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes most of our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales and profits were up versus prior year driven by progress on the Jazan ASU sale of equipment project this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a comment on our Corporate segment.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 17. Our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our corporate costs. Sales and profits were down versus last year on continued significantly lower LNG project activity.","As we have said, the lack of customer decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business, and we continue to expect at least a $0.30 headwind in LNG for FY 2017 versus FY 2016. We did see a positive impact from the TSAs with Evonik and Versum.","Now, please turn to slide 18, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, again, Simon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook.","As we move forward, I want to remind our shareholders that Air Products is in a very strong position. Our safety and operating performance continue to be strong. We have taken action to deliver our $100 million of operational improvements this year and are focused on additional action to offset the stranded cost from the separation of Materials Technologies business. We remain committed and confident in our ability to deliver on our cost savings and our EPS commitments.","Our portfolio actions and the strong cash flow generation of our company provides us with almost $5 billion of capacity to invest now and over $1 billion per year in addition for the future. So over the next three years, we expect to have at least $8 billion to deploy and we certainly intend to deploy that.","We are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident the risk-return profile will create significant value for our shareholders. And we see exciting opportunities to invest in M&A, asset buybacks and large industrial gas projects. However, we do continue to be cautious about the future. That was the investment we made in January and we have seen no significant reason to change our view. We continue to be concerned about the lack of concrete economic policy in the United States, the effect of Brexit on the UK and European economies, and overall geopolitical tensions in the Far and Middle East.","I would like to stress that the fact that we are cautious is not in any way, shape or form related to specific issues at Air Products. Air Products is doing well and you see that in the numbers and we continue to believe that Air Products by itself will continue to do well. But we cannot ignore the overall economic and geopolitical situation around the world and that is the reason for our cautious approach.","With this background, we are maintaining our guidance for full year 2017 at EPS of $6 to $6.25 per share with the (sic) [which at] midpoint, which is a substantial increase, of 9% over the previous year. And our guidance for the third quarter fiscal year 2017 EPS is $1.55 to $1.60 per share, which is also up 9% versus last year at midpoint.","At this point, again, I want to thank all of the employees of Air Products for their continued hard work and commitment in delivering another strong quarter of results in safety and financial performance. I am very proud to be a member of this winning team.","Now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And thank you. We do have our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, P.J. How are you doing this morning?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Doing good. Couple of questions on M&A. First on your Yingde acquisition, was that an opportunistic move on your part or was it more strategic? And if it was strategic, can you drill down more into that, why China, why now?","And the second question is on, any potential to get into packaged gases, which is more fragmented area, so maybe it's easier to get in, and would you consider that in Latin America, where you already have Indura assets? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, P.J. Our decision to pursue Yingde is definitely strategic. When you look at the projections of the GDP at purchase prosperity, by 2030, it is projected that China will have a GDP of about $33 billion, by far the largest economy in the world.","That is where the growth is right now. The growth is in China and in India by any kind of a measure. Therefore it was strategic and that we will continue to be focused on China. There are a lot of other opportunities other than Yingde and we are pursuing those, and I hope in the not too distant a future, we have some more news on that.","With respect to packaged gases, we are in the packaged gases business everywhere except the United States. So, the places that we are in packaged gases like in Latin America, like in Europe, like in China, we definitely are interested in expanding our packaged gases business. We continue to look at acquisitions in that area. The only area that we are not and we don't intend to be in packaged gases business is in the United States, because we believe that just the competition makes it very difficult to make money.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I was at the Annual IHS Conference recently and it sounded like China had worked out some of the early problems with their coal-to-MEG processes and were going forward with a number of projects. I assume those are going to be new oxygen for gasification for the glycol units there. Are you seeing activity there pick up at all?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","First of all, good morning, John. Yes, we are. This is why in the past call on, say, two years, we have been saying that we don't see any slowdown in coal gasification in China. We actually see opportunities. We do see opportunities. We are very well-positioned there. We already have three gigantic coal gasification plants operational, where we are supplying oxygen successfully to our customers. Those plants are running well. We are getting paid and we will be pursuing those from a good pole position.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And could you talk about the complexities that are trying to de-captivate more hydrogen from the refining industry. I think that was, early on, one of the key opportunities that you envisioned, but it seems like it's taking a fair amount of time.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Those opportunities are still there. It is going to take a fair amount of time because this is not a quick process, we have to demonstrate to people that we can create value, but we have a lot of projects underway and we are talking to customers and hopefully in time we will have appropriate news for you.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning. How are you?","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm well. I'm trying to reconcile maybe some competitor commentary and maybe broader industrial end market commentary in the U.S. with the still fairly anemic volume growth. Is there something particular to your asset base or chassis relative to where the growth is coming from in North America or do you think there really isn't much industrial growth in North America at the moment?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I'd like Corning to comment more on this, but first of all, there isn't anything unique about our portfolio that would prevent us from participating in economic growth if there is some. But the economic growth in the U.S. is not that much. It is \u2013 when you look at industrial production and all of that, so it is not that positive, but we have seen growth in the \u2013 actually when you look at gases volumes in the U.S. \u2013 I'm sure Corning will comment on this \u2013 but this is the first time in about six quarters that we're actually seeing growth. So, there is some, but we don't have any competitive disadvantage there. Corning, would you like to expand on this?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes. So, thank you, Bob, for the opportunity. So, we feel good about our volume growth that we had. You see the headline looking at overall Americas, obviously, that's impacted heavily on LOX\/LIN, and there's also some HyCO sales in that, and that's impacted when we have outages. But if we were going to look at some of the core products, liquid hydrogen, helium, argon, our growth rates are substantially higher in those areas, and I think that's particularly important to us.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful and for my follow-up. Seifi, we're not used to referencing raw material problems in Gases margins, is this specifically to some shorter duration business or you have some contracts that don't have escalators in for energy pass-throughs?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Bob, we call it raw materials, but it is all power. I mean, obviously air is free, but the power cost, that is what is driving that line. And we mentioned this thing last quarter, that significant number of the nuclear power plants in France were down, that pushed up their power prices. That has subsided, so in the future quarters you wouldn't see that, but that is what is driving that number.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","And if I could, that's obviously in our merchant business, right. We continue to have very robust pass-through of energy costs in our tonnage and onsite business.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Sorry about that. And our next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes on some of the other various drivers in your merchant businesses across both developed and emerging markets? I know you mentioned France on the former, but also if you could hit on China on the latter. And then also, maybe just what you're seeing in terms of operating rates in the Chinese market as well, especially your longer term assumptions. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure, Chris. Corning, I think, will address that.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So let's start with the operating rates. So operating rates for us are in the 70s around the world. Actually our highest rates are in Asia, where they're in the upper 70s and that would include China. The merchant business, by its virtue, is one that sees a wide range of customers, so that's what I would say is the driver for us, no specific one industry but a wide range of opportunities.","And in general, throughout the world, but particularly in China, we've driven a lot of strength in moving from retail to wholesale. So that's at a ratio really where it should be \u2013 I'm sorry, from wholesale to retail, and that's now at a ratio that's sort of at a global world-class for us. So all in all, I'd say the merchant business is positive for us. Even in South America, the liquid\/bulk business for us has been a positive last quarter and this quarter.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And actually, if I may, just on Brazil, a few different companies this morning have actually highlighted continued sluggishness, I'd say actually at best, outside of a few select consumer and healthcare-driven markets. Can you just walk us through a few key end markets there and just comment on what you're seeing on a sequential basis? And then even what you're hearing from some of your industrial customers. Thank you.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So let me start. First of all, when you look at our results in South America, again you're really just seeing a pure merchant play. And in Latin America, where largely, in terms of 100% owned and reported results, is for us Chile, Brazil and Colombia for the most part, different economies who have different issues in them.","So in the Chilean economy, very much related to mining, and I would say there had been strengthening earlier, but the Chilean economy still remains somewhat weak. I think the political situation there is a drag on the economy until the next election. On the positive side, the big strike at one of the copper mines is behind us now.","In Brazil, of course, you've got Carnival effect in this particular quarter, which is always a large impact for us. I'd say the strength that we see there in the liquid\/bulk versus in the packaged gas business, you could read that larger companies, more likely to be in an export sort of an industry, are doing better for us than perhaps people who are just serving the local market. Does that help?","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes, it's great detail. Thank you.","Operator","And now for our next question from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Steve, if you could check your mute function, please.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Why don't you move on to the next question.","Operator","I'll do that. We've got Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Seifi, regarding your cautiousness on the geopolitical outlook, aside from that, we are seeing a little bit of a pickup here in some of your organic volumes and maybe some pricing in various regions of the world, North America and Europe. What would you have to see, what would have to occur to make you less cautious on the geopolitical side?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Very simply, a very concrete economic policy that has passed Congress and it is enacted into law, so that we can make an assessment of what is happening in the United States. The second one is a concrete indication of what Brexit actually is going to mean. And the third thing is going to be hopefully a lessening of tensions in Far East and in the Middle East, that we are not going to get into another war. Those would be the three things.","Please, Jim, we are cautious about the future because we don't know what is going to happen in the future, so we need to be cautious about that. But as I said, Air Products is doing fine and we are very confident about what Air Products does, but if something significant happens, we need to be prepared for that.","But right now, everything about the U.S. economy is a guess. Nothing has passed Congress into law, whether it is taxes, whether it is infrastructure projects, nothing has passed into law, so we don't know what to expect and that's why we are being cautious. And Brexit, there is a lot of discussion about what's going to happen. One day it's going to be a hard negotiation, one day it's going to be soft negotiation. Now we are going to have election in UK. So, those are the ones that makes us a little bit cautious. Well, maybe we are too cautious, but that's usually not a bad thing.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then regarding your $8 billion capital deployment figure. You talked about a three-year timeframe for deploying that capital. And could you just elaborate a little further on how you think about deploying that capital internally through growth versus returning cash to shareholders? Do you stop every year or so and decide how you separate those two goals, or would you start to remunerate shareholders only after the three-year time period is up for assessing M&A opportunities?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Jim, first of all, I'd just like to clarify, I didn't give you a three-year timeline. So, the timeline is open. Number two, currently, we don't have any plans to return money to the shareholders because we think we can deploy the money. As time goes by, we'll see how well we are doing.","I mean, if in the first year and the second year, we have deployed zero, then I think the strategy will change. But overall, as I said before, considering what we are working on, we continue to be confident that we can put that money to work in good returns and create value for our shareholders.","That is what distinguishes Air Products from the other companies. That is our future. That is why we are not interested in big mergers and acquisitions. That's why, we are not running after buying another big company, because we do have the capability and a clear vision of what we are going to do. Air Products is going to do very well [as a] standalone, we don't need anybody's help.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Yes, good morning. Seifi. How are you?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","I'm very fine, Kevin, and yourself?","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Well, thank you. I wanted to ask you about the capital deployment and specifically, the category of DCAPs that you mentioned versus acquisitions in large projects. Just wondering if you could educate us a little bit more on how you see the opportunity set there?","For example, I imagine, it would take quite a lot of a DCAP deals to go about one by one and address individual oxygen or hydrogen units. And so, I'm wondering, if you see larger collections of assets and counterparties that would be, perhaps interested in doing a more wholesale a deal. And also why is it that things are apparently moving a bit slowly? For example, is there a dearth of interested counterparties at this particular juncture, or is that not the case and maybe there's just a wide bid-ask on the economics? Any color there would be appreciated.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure. Kevin, we are chasing pretty sizable projects. In order to deploy the $8 billion, it sounds like a lot of money, if we just had another four Jazan projects, that deploys all of the cash. We are pursuing very big projects and, as a result, it's going to take time, it's going to be more difficult, it's going to be more complicated, but that is the reason that we remain confident.","There are people who are very interested in talking to us about gasification, about expanding our scope of supply to syngas, those projects are all $2 billion, $3 billion projects. And in addition with the hydrogen, yes, we are looking at, sometimes, kind of making a wholesale deal with people in terms of acquiring many plants rather than just one or two plants. And in addition to that, there is a possibility that some assets will come available as a result of the merger of some other companies, so we are looking at all of that. So, putting all of that together, again at this stage, we believe we can deploy the cash, but time \u2013 thank you, Kevin.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna International Group.","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. This is Emily Wagner on for Don. Just a question on EMEA. I noticed you mentioned you were gaining positive pricing but this was offset by customer mix. Can you just describe the dynamic there and is there an opportunity to increase pricing to help offset the currency headwinds?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. The issue for us in pricing has, to date, really been around the power cost that Seifi referred to earlier that incurred in the first half. What's happened is we have made moves to recover those power cost increases. We've actually recovered about 50% of it so far.","You don't see that when you look at that slide right now, because at the same time, we had a mix in our customers where large customers took more product. And typically, with a large customer, our cost of supply is less, and therefore the pricing is less. So, for example, the person who takes a large container or a large load of helium in liquid phase versus in gaseous phase, lower cost of supply per molecule, lower molecule price to them. So, that's what's going on.","If we were going to look at, let's just say, March, where power rates were more where we expect them to run for the rest of the year and the overall gains we've made in pricing, we see ourselves well on track to recover the remaining 50%. So, we're quite confident on that. I'd rather not go into a timing discussion of that because I think that has some commercial implications for us in negotiations, but we think we're in a good position there.","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks very much. Seifi, you indicated that you were no longer pursuing Yingde. I was wondering how you came to the decision to no longer pursue it. And then in the way you termed it at the beginning of the call, you said that we're choosing no longer to pursue Yingde at this time. So, does that mean that under a different set of circumstances you might pursue it again?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Jeff, first of all, good morning. And as usual, you've always asked very good questions. I did use my words very carefully when I said at this time, because you never know what happens in terms of how the events turn out. There were many reasons that we decided to stop. And what did stop mean? If we wanted to pursue it, it means that we would have had to offer more than $6 a share. We decided that this is not the time to do that. At some future time, it might be the time to do that. So, I just wanted to not close the door there.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And when we look across your businesses, there's very slow growth for the industrial gas company and pricing is roughly zero or close to zero. So, does that mean that your products might have to reassess its cost initiatives again to see whether it can lift returns by another means?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, the thing is that \u2013 there is no question that the pricing is flat and the volume growth in the merchant business is nothing to write home about. We fully understand that. And that is why Air Products has chosen not to significantly expand our merchant business and our packaged gases business, and you know very well that that's why we didn't pursue some opportunities in that area.","We are focused on the large onsite projects and there are plenty of those projects to pursue. So, we believe that we will be able \u2013 by pursuing those projects, we will continue to be able to maintain our margins. Our goal is to maintain our margins at around 35%. And if because of the circumstances or certain events in the world, we would need to take a look at improving our productivity and our cost position in order to maintain our margins, we certainly will do that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning. How are you, Dave?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thank you. Just on pricing in North America, Seifi, I know it remains challenging right now, but what's the potential, do you think, over the next two to three years for some pricing traction to be gained here in North America?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Dave, you do know that it will be very difficult for us to make any comments about prices. So, I would like to take a rain check on that, if you don't mind, Dave.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Just lastly on the maintenance costs that we're seeing, a little bit elevated currently. Can you quantify the impact and how that might benefit perhaps Q4 or even next year?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","I think Corning should address that. I obviously don't like it, but Corning will have comments on that.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","So, I'd say we're in the neighborhood of $0.03 for us on maintenance in this quarter. We'll see a slightly higher \u2013 also we'll see, relative to last year, higher costs next quarter, fourth quarter we'll be a little less. Let me just stress though, these are maintenance costs, and we're talking about hydrogen SMRs largely being what swings the numbers around. These are plants that come down every three years, four years for maintenance. And so it's, by its nature, lumpy.","I think we have made great progress in this area. And the outage that we took this last quarter in Europe, that plant had been operating for over 1,300 days, right. And we're going to push and push with regulatory people, the right to continue to operate that plant longer, as we've gotten smarter and better in how we operate and maintain these plants on the fly. So, I think there's a positive story there, but we're always going to have this up and down as when this project is scheduled.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Mike. How are you? You have another difficult question for me, huh?","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Doing well. Thank you. Yes, I'll try. Looking for some color on replacing the $70 million of lost revenue to Airgas, do you have efforts underway already to find the new customers to replace that? And how much of a headwind could that loss be to your capacity utilization? In other words, trying to get to an idea of what the decremental margin could look like on that $70 million.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Corning, will answer the question, but I just want to say that we were not making a lot of money selling anything to Airgas, so that's why we have stopped, but \u2013 Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So, you can imagine, we have known for quite a long time where this contract \u2013 when it was going to terminate. We're on it. We've got people focused on filling in the volumes. I'd rather not talk a lot about particular progress or margins just because I think that gives one competitor, in particular, a pretty good ability to calculate into our economics.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then, was also hoping that you could comment on the Jazan project in the Global Gases segment. The $24.5 million in EBITDA for this quarter, can we model a similar EBITDA number for Q3 and Q4? Can you give us any guidance on that?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, we don't want to give you any numbers, but I would like to say that the Jazan project is making good progress. We are on schedule. We are on plan. So I don't see any reason why the number \u2013 why we would have any kind of a significant change there. But overall, I'd rather not break it down because then you have to break down what is the negative effect of LNG and all of that. But overall, for Jazan, we are doing fine.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just have one question left and I'm just hoping, Scott, you can maybe boil down all the moving parts on the margin, we x-out the pass-through. Just give us some guidance on how we should be modeling underlying margins for the balance of the fiscal year sequentially would be helpful.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay. Scott, do you want to comment?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Absolutely. So, maybe just let me reiterate here for this quarter versus last year. So, we have a 140 basis point decline from the higher energy pass-through and then a 120 impact from the SOE mix as was described, which leaves an underlying margin down of about 40 basis points. Then as we move forward, and we don't know where natural gas is going to go, we've given you the sensitivity in the past that for every change in natural gas, $1 per MMbtu, is about $250 million per year in revenue. So, you can put it in whatever you think for natural gas on that.","In terms of [what] Seifi just mentioned, we'll continue to execute on Jazan and that project is going well. And also as we've talked about, the LNG business continues to be down towards the bottom. And so we don't see a lot of change in either one of those. I would say though, just kind of all else equal and keeping natural gas where it is, maybe it's in the 33-type of range, and we were just short of that this past quarter, and for the year maybe it's something in that area. But again, I'd ask you to go back and plug in what you assume the natural gas is going be, okay?","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. That was very helpful.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Vincent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, two quick ones. First, how much of a tailwind, if any, is your HyCO business going to see from refiners gearing up to deal with the new marine fuel regulations starting in 2020? And secondly, as you look at your pursuit of larger projects in gasification, are you going to see sort of a longer ramp-up for those projects, as they become larger in size? Are we looking at more like three to four-year ramps as opposed to two-year ramps?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I'll answer your second question and I'll have Corning answer your first question. Yes, as the projects become bigger and so on, you're right. Instead of a two-year turnaround for an ASU, it will be a four-year, five-year, that is very correct assumption. And on your first question, Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, I'm sorry to confirm for you, when you look at the crude light's blend and everything else, the split, how they run it, we don't see a huge impact for us in terms of incremental demand with the new marine regs. I think that's not going to be a huge impact.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay. With that then, I think that we would like to \u2013 we have gone over the time, but no problem. I just like to thank everybody for being on the call, we do appreciate that. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter.

Please go ahead.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter 2017 earnings release teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and in today's earnings release.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.","The talented, committed and dedicated team of Air Products, our people, delivered an excellent set of results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, our earnings per share was up 18% versus last year, and for all of fiscal year 2017, earnings per share was up 12%. This is the 14th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year EPS growth. This is also the third consecutive year that we have delivered earning per share growth of more than 10%. We generated strong cash flow and returned about $800 million of that to our shareholders through dividends.","We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with EBITDA margins of over 34%. We have a great team that is totally focused on delivering strong performance day-in and day-out. Ultimately, our success is built on providing excellent service to our customers. We are committed to providing them with the right innovations and solutions to make their processes better.","Now please turn to slide number 3. You can see the significant progress we have made on improving our safety results, a reduction of 75% in our lost time injury rate. This result is a clear indication that all of our 15,000 employees around the world are totally focused on safety and operational excellence. This focus is also a significant driving force for our strong financial performance.","Now please turn to slide number 4 which was our goal for the company. As I explained at the beginning of this call, we have made great progress and are determined to continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. At the end of this call, I'll talk about modification that we have made to our goal to include the diversity and inclusion as a significant part of our goal as we go forward.","Now please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times. We continue to be focused on shareholder value, cash generation, capital allocation and an empowered and decentralized organization.","Now please turn to slide number 6, where you can see, the one that you have seen many times before, our five-point plan which is the foundation of our success.","Please turn to slide number 7, where I would like to take a few minutes to remind everybody of the progress we have made in the last three years. Specifically, I want to talk about the promises we made three years ago, and the results we have actually delivered. In 2014, we made several commitments to ourselves and to our shareholders. And as I recall, there may have been some skepticism in the investment community at the time, about our ability to deliver these results. So, let's update you on where we are today.","Three years ago, we said that Air Products would be the safest industrial gas company in the world. We would be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We would divest our non-core assets. We would have the best balance sheet in the industry. And we would deliver 10% earnings per share growth every year. I am very proud of our team for delivering on every one of these promises.","On slide 8, you can see the result of the first two commitments. We are today, the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have delivered significant improvement in our employee lost time injury rate, and we have an EBITDA margin of 34% which is up 900 basis points versus three years ago.","On a slide number 9, you can see our success in divesting on our non-core assets. We sold our chemical business to Evonik for almost 16 times EBITDA, and I'm convinced that this business and the people involved, will thrive in Evonik.","We spun-off our Electronics Materials business as an independent company called Versum Materials. The Versum team is 100% focused on the electronic market as a leading material supplier. They have delivered strong results, and the Versum stock is currently trading at almost 14 times EBITDA in fact a higher multiple than Air Products right now.","Now please turn to slide number 10, which shows the result of our improved business performance and the successful transactions that we have made. Air Products has the strongest balance sheet in the industry. So we are well positioned to take advantage of the tremendous growth opportunities that we see in Industrial Gases. This is our future growth and as you can see we delivered EPS growth of 10% in 2015, 16% in 2016 and 12% in 2017.","Now please turn to slide number 11 to summarize, the hardworking and committed team at Air Products has delivered on what we promised, and what is most exciting to me right now is that we are very well positioned to grow Air Products and create significant further value for our shareholders. We now have the balance sheet to do it.","Now please turn to slide number 12 for a summary of our fiscal year 2017 accomplishments. I previously mentioned, the Versum spin and PMD sales. I want to thank the very hard working teams at Air Products, we have successfully executed our major projects. We brought on-stream a very large hydrogen project in India, a large air separation plant in Korea and our seventh large plant in China, providing oxygen to coal gasification. We continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and currently expect on-stream in phases starting in fiscal 2019.","The picture at the bottom of the slide shows the six air separation unit trains already erected at the site. And to try to bring a sense of the scale of these huge air separation units, the top picture shows just one of the cold boxes before it was shipped from China to the site. And each one of those small dots that make up the sign CG for our cogen facility is actually one of our people.","In terms of safety, in September, we mark one of the most significant safety accomplishments in Air Products history when the Jazan project achieved 19 million (sic) [15 million] man hours of work without any lost time injuries. A great example from one of the very large complicated and challenging projects being executed safely by our teams around the world.","We also established a world-class technology center in the Dhahran Techno Valley Science Park to serve Saudi Arabia and the Middle East region. And finally, we continue to win new projects around the world for key customers in the electronics, manufacturing and chemical markets that will drive growth for Air Products and create value for shareholders.","I would like to also take a minute to highlight our clear focus on excellence in technology, engineering, manufacturing, procurement and construction, which are all essential to our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value.","We are very pleased that Dr. Samir Serhan joined Air Products last year, bringing deep knowledge and experience in the leadership of these critical functions. In alignment with our five-point plan, Dr. Serhan recently lead our teams through a thorough review of the strengths and opportunities in each one of the areas I mentioned above. We are now executing on clear improvements in our plant design, organizational design, work processes, footprint and talent development, while maintaining and leveraging our existing strengths. I am confident that the actions that Samir has taken will sharpen our product line focus, improve our competitiveness and subsequently enable us to deliver on our growth objectives.","Now please turn to slide number 13, which summarizes the very exciting project expansion with Lu'An Clean Energy in Shanxi, China. As we announced this 15 September, we will form a $1.3 billion joint venture with Lu'An that will own and operate the air separation units, gasifiers and syngas clean-up system to provide syngas to Lu'An under a long-term agreement.","This is a great example of Air Products expanding our scope of supply consistent with our business model. We continue to make good progress on the necessary approvals and are hopeful we can close on the joint venture at some point during fiscal year 2018. However, due to some uncertainty in the timing of the necessary government approvals, we have not, and I would like to stress, we have not included any contribution from Lu'An project in our EPS or CapEx guidance for fiscal year 2018.","Now please turn to slide number 14, which shows you the results of our three key metrics for the quarter and year. These are the financial metrics that we use. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these three key metrics. We remain focused on driving prudent improvements as we move forward.","Now please turn to a slide number 15, my favorite slide. It's great to see our margins improve again this quarter, and up slightly versus last year. It also illustrates the 900 basis point improvement versus 3.5 years ago.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, Seifi. Now I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2017 results before discussing our fourth quarter results.","Please turn to Slide 16. In summary for the year, higher volumes and productivity drove significant profit growth and delivered record EPS. Total sales increased 9%, with underlying sales up 7%. Volumes were broadly higher up 6%, with pricing up 1%. Unfavorable currency reduced sales by 1%, while higher energy pass-through increased sales by 3%.","EBITDA of $2.8 billion increased 7%, while our EBITDA margin of 34.1% declined 80 basis points. Excluding the impact of higher energy pass-through, EBITDA margin was up 10 basis points versus prior year. Operating income of $1.8 billion increased 9%, and our operating margin of 21.6% was unchanged. Record earnings per share increased by 12% and our ROCE came in at 12.1%.","Slide number 17, shows our distributable cash flow of more than $8 per share. We believe this measure more than EPS is the true measure of the value we're creating for our shareholders. Our distributable cash flow increased as a result of our strong performance in FY 2017, with EBITDA growth more than offsetting higher maintenance CapEx. Free cash flow of $450 million was modestly lower as a result of higher dividend payments, which were up 9%.","Now, please turn to slide 18 to review our full year EPS. Year-on-year EPS growth of $0.67, or 12%, was driven primarily by higher volumes and lower cost driven by our productivity actions. Higher volumes added $0.29, as growth across our Gases segments more than offset weakness in LNG. Price of raw materials taken together was favorable $0.03 primarily from Gases Asia. And cost contributed $0.24 as our focused productivity actions in all our segments more than offset inflation.","Currency was a negative $0.03 impact. Other non-operating income added $0.10 from interest income. Since this is non-operating, it is not included in our EBITDA or operating income results. All other items totaled $0.04 favorable.","Now, please turn to slide 19 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. For the quarter, we also delivered record EPS. Sales of $2.2 billion, increased 13% versus last year with underlying sales up 11% on 9% higher volumes and 2% better pricing. Higher energy cost pass-through in favorable currency each added 1%. Volumes were higher across all three Gases regions and taken together, the regions had a positive impact on overall volumes of 11%.","From a volume standpoint, continued progress on our Jazan project was more than offset by the continued weakness in LNG. Overall pricing improved mainly due to Gases Asia. EBITDA of $769 million improved by 13%. And operating income of $493 million improved by 16% driven by overall higher volumes, productivity as well as Asia pricing.","EBITDA margin of 34.9% increased by 10 basis points and was negatively impacted by 30 basis points from higher energy cost pass-through. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margin was up 40 basis points. Operating margin of 22.4% improved by 50 basis points versus prior year. Net income increased by 19% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 18% versus prior year. ROCE of 12.1% declined by 30 basis points versus last year and 10 basis points sequentially.","To provide you with some context sequentially ROCE was lower although profits were higher. This is because the denominator of the ROCE calculation has increased. The denominator is based on a five quarter average, and this now includes three quarters with a significantly higher denominator as a result of the gain from the PMD sale.","Now please turn to slide 20. Looking at our Q4 cash flows we had a strong finish to fiscal 2017. Q4 distributable cash flow was over $600 million, while our free cash flow was $250 million. Free cash flow was up $100 million versus last year, due to higher EBITDA.","Now, please turn to slide 21. Before I discuss our underlying results, I want to spend a moment on several non-GAAP items that totaled a positive $0.39 per share. First, we made a tax selection that allowed us to recognize a tax loss on our Latin American Indura business. This resulted in a $111 million tax benefit, or $0.50 per share. To be clear, this is not reflective of a new loss or charge for this business, but rather the opportunity to recognize tax benefits from previous losses.","A $12 million gain on a land sale was $0.03 per share. And finally, $48 million, or $0.14 per share of cost reduction and asset actions that include Dr. Serhan's work to restructure our engineering, manufacturing, and technology organizations. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.","Excluding non-GAAP items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $1.76 increased $0.27 per share, or 18%, versus last year. Higher volumes broadly increased EPS by $0.09 per share. Pricing and raw materials, taken together, increased EPS by $0.07. China pricing strengthened again this quarter.","Net cost performance was favorable $0.06, as our productivity actions and the TSA income more than offset inflation. We are pleased that we delivered on a $100 million productivity commitment this year. As a reminder, included in the cost major factor, is the other income and expense line on the consolidated P&L.","As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements, or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik. The cost to provide these services are primarily in SG&A. The payment we received for these services was about $10 million this quarter and is shown in the other income and expense line. We expect these TSAs to wind down in the first half of 2018 and are committed to taking actions to reduce the costs associated with providing these services.","Depending on the exact timing, we may see a brief gap between the end of the revenue from the TSAs and the cost savings. For the quarter, currency and foreign exchange gains and losses net to $0.02 favorable, as we experienced a weaker dollar particularly versus the euro as the trend from earlier this year reversed.","Equity affiliate income added $0.02 due to the underlying strength across a number of our joint ventures. Other non-operating income added $0.03 due to interest income. Interest expense was $0.01 favorable as our lower debt balance more than offset higher rates. Tax, non-controlling interest, and shares outstanding reached $0.01 unfavorable.","Turning to slide 22, I would like to update you on our capital deployment capacity. We have about $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments as of September 30. After maintaining a modest operating cash balance, we have about $3.5 billion of cash available to invest. Our debt balance as of September 30 is about $4 billion. As you know, we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A\/A2 rating.","We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Based on a trailing 12 months EBITDA of $2.8 billion, this would support a debt level in the range of about $5.5 billion to $7 billion. So in total, between our available cash and additional debt capacity, we have about $5.5 billion we can deploy today while maintaining our A\/A2 rating. As we have mentioned, we also expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investable cash, that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx and dividends. So, as Seifi mentioned, over the next three years, we expect to have a total of at least $8 billion available to invest.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. Please turn to slide number 23. FY 2017 was a good year across our regional businesses. We grew both sales and profits in all three of them and concluded the year on a high note. In summary, I'd say in the Americas, the profit improvement was driven primarily by higher volumes and productivity. In EMEA, the team overcame currency headwinds through productivity actions. And in Asia, we had great success in both volume and pricing.","We made significant productivity gains this year, while at the same time supporting merchant demand growth. For example, our investments in distribution efficiency have helped us absorb the higher distribution costs inherent in our drive to increase our retail business. We ended the year with two quarters of sequential sales and profit growth in each of the three regions, and we delivered record quarterly profits in Q4.","I would like to thank our team around the world for all of their dedication and hard work in achieving exceptional safety and business results in FY 2017.","Now please turn to slide 24, Gases Americas. Before discussing our results, I'd like to express a special thanks to our operating team in the Gulf Coast. As is our practice, teams of employees volunteered to ride out Hurricane Harvey in our facilities to ensure safe and reliable supply to our customers. Our plants operated extremely well, did not sustain any damage, and we only shutdown plants due to low customer demand, we were able to keep running. Reliability is an important part of our business model and we delivered. Our team did all this safely and efficiently under trying conditions. Well done.","The hurricane had little to no impact on costs and only a modest impact on sales. As a result of our people's dedication and the strength of our business throughout the Americas, we are very pleased to report strong results despite the hurricane.","For this quarter, sales were at $953 million dollars, an increase of 9% versus last year. Volumes were up 7% while currency and energy pass-through were both up 1%. North American volumes grew on strong hydrogen volumes, as our refinery customers continue to operate at a high-level with less plant maintenance outages, despite the destructions caused by the hurricane. We also saw positive volume across our other product lines in North America. Latin American volumes were up slightly this quarter versus prior year, moreover economic activity remains weak. The overall pricing impact was slightly positive, but rounded to flat versus last year as higher North American pricing more than offset negative Latin America pricing.","EBITDA of $402 million was up 14% as higher volumes, lower planned maintenance costs and our Taking the Lead productivity programs more than offset the hurricane impact on volumes. EBITDA margin of 42.2% was up 220 basis points higher than last year, driven by higher volume and cost savings. Higher energy pass-through reduced the margin by about 60 basis points. So excluding this, the margin was up about 280 basis points. Sequentially, EBITDA was up 9% primarily driven by lower planned maintenance costs and stronger volumes.","Now please turn to slide 25. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the volume growth versus prior year and prior quarter was driven primarily by our new hydrogen plant in India that was on-stream for the full quarter. As a reminder, this 100% owned facility is reported in the EMEA segment, while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in Asia equity affiliate income.","Versus last year, sales of $515 million were up 24% with volumes up 18%. Currency, primarily the euro, added another 5%. While the new India plant was the strong majority of the volume growth, our LOX\/LIN and cylinder volumes were both up mid-single digits with the base business contributing almost 3% to the segment volume growth. Overall, pricing was slightly positive but rounded to flat as slightly higher underlying real pricing was partially offset by customer end product mix.","EBITDA of $180 million was up 17% compared to prior year, again primarily driven by the new plant in India. However, the higher merchant sales, productivity and positive currency impact also improved profitability. EBITDA margin of 35% was down 220 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the new India plant. We are very pleased with the returns of this new project in India. But since there is always a significant amount of natural gas pass-through in any hydrogen project and natural gas is particularly expensive here, it is margin dilutive. EBITDA was up 16% sequentially on higher volumes productivity and positive currency.","Please turn to slide 26, Gases Asia, where our pricing and sales momentum continued. Sales of $552 million were up 23%, compared to prior year driven by strong volume and increased prices. Volumes were up 17% roughly split 60:40 between new plants, primarily Yitai, and our base business. Merchant volumes were up across all product lines and the LOX\/LIN retail to wholesale ratio continued to improve.","Sequentially reported volumes were down due to the equipment sale last quarter. We raised prices significantly in the merchant market in China which drove the overall 6% increase for the region. Our team worked hard to raise prices across all liquid businesses and was particularly successful in the spot and wholesale markets.","We believe China's government's focus on consolidating the steel industry and its corresponding impact on captive air separation plants, has improved the supply-demand balance. That said, we are closely monitoring this market as spot and wholesale pricing can be volatile.","EBITDA of $224 million, was up 31% compared to prior year, driven by the strong volumes and higher pricing. EBITDA margin of 40.6% was up 240 basis points.","Finally, please turn to slide 27 for a brief comment on our Global Gasses segment, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business, as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales were up $14 million, while profits were down $10 million versus prior year. We continue to make good progress on the Jazan project. But as you may remember, we recorded a large profit in Q4 of FY 2016 making for a tough comparison for this quarter.","Now I'll turn the call back to Simon for a comment on our Corporate segment.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 28. Our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our Helium container business and our corporate costs. For the year, segment sales were down about $150 million and EBITDA was down about $90 million, primarily driven by significantly lower LNG project activity. For the quarter, in addition to the weaker LNG business, we also had a negative impact from Helium inventory revaluation. For FY 2018, although we still not yet seen LNG customers moving forward with their investment decisions, we don't anticipate an earnings headwind for the Corporate segment.","Now I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, again, Simon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about Air Products' future. As I discussed earlier, we are very proud of having delivered on our promises from three years ago. And we are excited about the opportunity to build on our success. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continues to be strong. In fiscal year 2018 and beyond, we will continue to focus on productivity, which remains an important factor in delivering our earnings per share growth commitment.","As you will recall, three years ago we had stated that we will deliver $600 million of productivity improvement. Up to now we have delivered more than $475 million and we will deliver the balance in the next two years or three years. As you know, our portfolio actions and strong cash flow generation of our company provides us with an expected capacity of over $8 billion to invest over the next three years. I am confident that Air Products will be successful in utilizing our balance sheet to invest in our core Industrial Gases business to create significant value for our shareholders.","Let me review the investment opportunities we see for the growth that I'm talking about. First, acquisition of small and medium-sized industry or gas companies or assets from businesses from our industrial gas competitors.","The second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee.","This is what we call asset buybacks and we see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category. We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units and sale of syngas to customers under long-term agreements.","Essentially these opportunities are as the same as the traditional onsite business model that we have, something that we do every day, but with existing rather than new production assets. The Lu'An project that we described before is a perfect example of this area of possible growth for us. We expect to do more of these. And the third area of opportunity is the very large industrial gas projects around the world, driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy and emerging market growth.","The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these projects can be. The plant we are building in Jazan is the largest project in the history of industrial gas industry with close to $2 billion of capital investment. Some of these new large projects that I'm talking about could also include gasification and syngas supply. We are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident the risk return profile will create significant value for our shareholders.","Now please turn to slide number 29. Our great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented and motivated employees remain focused on being the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Continuing our positive momentum, we expect to deliver earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.05 per share for fiscal year 2018, up 9% to 12% from our very strong fiscal year 2017 performance. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment to grow earnings per share by at least 10% each year in the future.","For quarter one of fiscal year 2018, our earnings per share guidance is $1.60 to $1.70, up 9% to 16% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2018.","As I mentioned before, our EPS and CapEx guidance do not include any contribution from the Lu'An project or any other M&A opportunities that we might execute during the year. We are certainly working on other opportunities that could potentially add to our results in fiscal year 2018, but have not included any other significant acquisition in our guidance.","Let me summarize on the slide number 30. I'm proud of the performance that our great team delivered in the last few years. I'm very excited about the potential for Air Products in 2018 and beyond to deliver real growth in our sales and profitability.","Please turn to slide number 31. In addition to being the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, we are now elevating our commitment to diversity and inclusion by explicitly incorporating it in our goal. This a natural extension of the culture that we're building at Air Products.","I believe this focus on diversity and inclusion will actually contribute to maintaining our position as the most profitable industrial gas company over the long-term. Because, as I've always said, the degree of commitment and motivation of our people is the real sustainable competitive advantage that we have. We want to ensure that we are providing opportunities and the right environment for everyone to contribute and succeed regardless of their gender, color, race, religion, orientation, country of origin or any other dimension of diversity.","At this point, we will be delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just on the merchant pricing in China, obviously nice acceleration from 4% last quarter to 6% this quarter. Where do you think we are in terms of utilization rates there, feels like there's been a very significant uptick in the past few quarters. Do you think we're in the mid 80%s? I felt like you were being a little bit conservative maybe on the outlook, just talking about how it can lump around. But what are you seeing, and what do you think the bull and bear cases on this line item are going forward?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","First of all, good morning, Vincent. I'm going to ask Corning to answer the specifics, but I'd just like to say that you have to make a distinction between utilization of the overall industrial gas companies in China and our utilization rate. So, Corning is going to address our utilization rate. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So our utilization rates are in the low 80%s. I think, you're fishing for what we think the larger market might be. But I think, with the dynamic situation in the steel industry, it's difficult to make a precise estimate of where we think overall industry loading is at. Clearly though, the supply-demand dynamic is better than it has been.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up. In the Americas, year-over-year there was an issue with lower maintenance expense. But then obviously also the volume came back nicely and I would assume that had an incremental positive impact. So, can you just help us bridge last year to this year and what was the gross positive benefit from the maintenance, or would you say the volume was maybe better anyway regardless of the difference in maintenance year-over-year?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So I would say the volume was a positive for us if we look across the business. Maintenance was a mild positive for us if we look at the fourth quarter. If we look at the full year, relatively flat.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, Vincent, I'd just like to add that one of the main drivers for our volume growth grow is our hydrogen business.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. You hit a little on this during your prepared remarks, but can you just kind of give us a little more detail on the update on the Lu'An, just the regulatory process, I guess this is the original four to six months. I guess this the reasoning for excluding it from your fiscal year 2018 guidance. And then more importantly probably as well as the Chinese opportunity that may await once you receive the regulatory approval? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Chris. Chris, with respect to Lu'An, the approval that we need is that Lu'An is a state-owned company. Whatever they need to do has to be approved by SESAK, which is the overall controller of all of the assets for all of the state-owned companies in China. That process does take time, it is difficult to make an assessment. We quite honestly had a lot of debate about what to do about this thing and we thought that the best thing is to say that, let's not exclude it in our estimate and then when the time comes and we get approval we will obviously add it.","But I'd just like to say that Lu'An on a full-year operating basis, if it was operating for the full year, it will contribute to our bottom-line about $0.25, $0.26. So now, during fiscal year 2017 (sic) [fiscal year 2018] whenever it comes up we will inform you. We expect this process to take about five months or six months, it's just like a little bit like anti-trust approval. But we don't know for sure. But as soon as that happens, and we close, we will let the investment community know, and we will adjust our guidance accordingly.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","With respect to other projects in China, obviously we are working on other projects in China and when and if they happen, we will obviously make an announcement.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And you hit a little on the merchant pricing, but overall just results across it seems China and India continue to do well. Can you just walk us through rough expectations for Asia? If you have any additional comments by country and I even think of a project or two in South Korea as well. So any additional comments there would be helpful. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, you know we've been saying this for quite a while, Chris, that we are very positive about growth opportunities in China. India is growing very fast; you don't see the results because we don't consolidate the numbers. We are making very good progress in Korea. We are executing a lot of \u2013 so we feel very positive about that region. Corning would you like to add anything?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So let me just say, I think in China, it's across many different industry groups where we're seeing success, and you see that in merchant which really cuts across most manufacturing fields out there. In a country like Korea, the overall economy, I would say, is not quite as dynamic as the Chinese, but the electronics one is very strong, and we're well positioned to succeed there and have an active project in Pyeongtaek and are already building the second plant for that. So I think that's where we see the growth in a country like that.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Don. How are you doing?","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Very good, thank you. Question on the underlying business, you've had a pickup in volume growth. I think you were 6% for the year, but you were 9% for the quarter. If you strip out some of the new projects like India, it would appear that you're seeing some accelerating momentum in your base business in merchant and cylinder gas globally. Is that the case and how do you feel about that momentum as 2018 unfolds?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I think that is the case quite honestly, when you look at what our competitors have announced, you get a sense for that. So overall, we are seeing positive signs for the overall industrial gas industry. And based on what we see right now, we are obviously positive for 2018, but anything can happen. But in general, there is a positive environment for all of us. Corning, you want to add?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Maybe just to clarify for that. In our base number, you know, India is in our equity affiliate. So the biggest driver you're seeing in there is really in the other areas. And if I was going to look in a region like Europe, the base business up 3%. and that's both package gases, which has been on a rebound for us for over a year. But the liquid bulk is a more positive trend for us. So I'd say mildly improving conditions, and that we're seeing that across many of the industries that we serve.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And Corning, how about in North America as opposed to Latin America, are you seeing an improvement in merchant business as well?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Don, to be clear, most of the improvement we saw was really in the HyCO space for us. I'd say we clearly had positive LOX\/LIN volume growth for the quarter, but it was modest.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","The growth in the U.S. is very modest.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. There were $48 million in restructuring charges. Are those cash charges, or non-cash or what's the split? And in the funds flow statement there was $165 million annual benefit from other adjustments. Is that something that we'll repeat next year or it won't?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","I think, the best person to answer this, is Scott. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Jeff. This is Scott. So, in terms of the costs for the restructuring, yeah, there'll be cash costs that we'll see. We saw a little bit in this quarter, but most of it that will be seen early part of next year. So yes, there will be a cash cost that's in there.","And the other thing in terms of the cash flow statement and a comment on the other tax election. So as I've mentioned, we took a restructuring over South America business that allowed us to recognize a loss that partially offset the gain for Evonik. So, we also saw a benefit, that could be $111 million of benefit to the cash flow statement, about a third of that came for forward in the fourth quarter and the other two-thirds will be in the second quarter, is when we expect to see that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then was the contribution from Jazan in the fourth quarter similar to what it was in the third quarter or different? And did you notice that Praxair signed a deal with BASF in the syngas area in Louisiana. And do you think that that shows that the syngas area is now sort of identified by the industrial gas industry generally and will become more competitive over time?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, with respect to the Jazan thing, I think there wasn't much of a difference between the third quarter and fourth quarter. And then with respect to the syngas, they did announce that they are doing something with BASF on syngas though quite honestly, a month ago, we did \u2013 about a month and a half ago, we are building bigger project for Huntsman in the same area. It's a very large HyCO unit providing CO to their MDI unit.","So, I think, the idea of providing \u2013 they've been providing basically syngas to most of these companies when they build SMRs. The part that we are getting into is when that syngas is being converted to other materials like liquids or diesel fuel and so on, we are getting involved in that part and I'll leave it for the other company to come and if they are getting into that or not.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Duffy Fisher with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, fellas.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Duffy. How are you?","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good. Just question again on Jazan, to follow-on there a little bit. That has been sequentially somewhat lumpier times since we've undertaken it. Can you give us any guidance as we go through this year, should we expect meaningful lumpiness and can you help us with which quarters might be up or down significantly if that's the case?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","I don't expect any lumpiness because quite honestly that project is going very smoothly. The reason that it was lumpy last year in 2016 was because we were not taking any profit for a while, just making sure that the project is real and is on-stream. But during the course of 2017, it has been very kind of not very lumpy and we don't expect that to be \u2013 we expect that to be smooth for the balance of 2018.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just on Lu'An, you talked about kind of that $0.25 of profitability the first year, should we think about that as a baseline that would then grow roughly in line with what Air Products does kind of 10%-plus, or is there some natural synergies there that would mean year two and year three should see meaningfully faster growth than what the base company would see?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","The agreement that we have on Lu'An is like our other onsite agreements. It is a fixed BFC. So, the profitability of that business is going to be approximately $0.25, $0.26 on an annual basis, and it will be the same in the future except for some adjustments for inflation. So, that's \u2013 it's not a business that is going to grow beyond adjustments that we have agreed with other side for inflation. So that is the good thing because it's not going to go down, it's going to be consistent and it's fixed fee that we charge to Lu'An for providing syngas. Thank you.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Terrific, thank you guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Seifi, your backlog of $1.5 billion was \u2013 it's quite strong in Asia, but has only two projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast. So when the industry adds investment on the Gulf Coast, do you expect to see more projects down the road in your backlog?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes if there are projects done in the Gulf Coast, when they would happen, we expect to get our fair share of the market. Yes. But there are not that many projects being executed in the Gulf Coast.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And the long-term question for you, Seifi. You know a lot about lithium and electric cars, given your background from Rockwood. Do you think that electrification of automobiles will be negative for hydrogen assets for the industry? And you could end up with some stranded assets down the road? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","No, not at all, I actually the way I see that P.J. is that I think that the industry, I'm not an expert, but I tell you my view. I think the industry is going to shift to electric for sure. But then people are going to find out that now they have to generate the electricity. And certain countries like China, they have a lot of coal that they can burn, it's called clean coal gasification, which is great for us, to use the coal and create clean electricity.","But there are countries like Japan, how do you generate electricity in Japan? That is why in Japan, and you look at Toyota, they are not working on electric cars, they are working on hydrogen cars, because they don't have coal to generate electricity and they don't want to do nuclear.","I see the transition over time by internal combustion engine, electric cars and eventually hydrogen. So we are very bullish on that and we are, as you know, the leader in this field. And this is a long-term thing, it will happen 15, 20 years from now. But right now we are very active in this area and we see actually a very great future for hydrogen cars, which would be a better solution in the long-term than electric cars.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And are you actively investing in hydrogen cars or creating hydrogen assets for hydrogen powered cars?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We are actually investing, yes, quite a bit in \u2013 not in the production of the hydrogen cars, but in production of fueling station and creating fueling stations, so that when you have your hydrogen car, you can go like a gas station and fill your car with hydrogen. We have some of those operational. If you are in Los Angeles, we can show you those where it says Air Products and you can actually drive there and fill up your car with hydrogen. We are working on hundreds of these, we are working on those in the United States, in California. We have a joint venture now, with Shinwa in China to do this. We are working on this thing in Japan. We are working on this thing in Europe. Yes, we are active. I think of all of the industrial gas companies, we are the most active in this area.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. You know Seifi, over the past year in particular we've seen a lot of environmental-related supply constraints across various industries in China. If I look at your volume numbers in Asia they're up 17% I think you indicated two-thirds of that was new plants, so maybe you know mid-single digits baseline growth. And so my question is are you seeing or not seeing any impact from some of those supply constraints broadly in China? Or put differently, would your volume numbers in Asia be even better were that not the case?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes, the environmental constraints in China are very beneficial to us, because one of the effects of the environmental constraints is the shutting down of a lot of inefficient steel industry, which is basically elimination of our competitors because those are small steel companies. Each had an air suppression unit and there was a competitor. So from that point of view it's positive. The second thing is that China is moving in a big way towards clean coal technology and that is why you see all of these gasification projects. That is why we are focused on them.","So overall, we are benefiting from the constraints that they are putting there. That is why, when we talk about growth in the future. You always see that we talk about energy, about environment and about emerging markets. So, that is a very positive trend for us. And fortunately, we are in a leading position of us coal gasification and we will see a lot of benefits and a lot of big projects in the future.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you for that. And then, second question on EMEA. A volume of 18% there, what would that number have been, were it not for the new plant in India. How would you characterize the baseline growth regionally in EMEA?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","That would have been 3%.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Just a quick one, I'm wondering if there are any rays of hope out there on the LNG side? I think you said it's not going to get worse, but I guess we've seen oils rally 25% or 30% here in the last three or four months. Is that something that might start some increased activity?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Bob. Bob, I said our LNG base basically is right now, is not making any money. We have restructured the business in such a way that we wouldn't lose anything. So we are at the bottom. Anything that happens will be on the upside.","Depending on whom you talk to the industry and I'm sure you are very much \u2013 very knowledgeable on this thing, different people take different views. We are prepared to live with \u2013 we have said that 2018, we don't expect any improvement, but in 2019, 2020, I think it will come back because no matter how you look at it, the world expect \u2013 the world is going to need LNG. So, it's just a matter of riding through the cycle. But fortunately, for us the worst is over.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And Seifi, you characterized that China changed behavior towards some of these end markets or production assets helping you. Is there also some scope that, as we've seen in some industries, these will only be temporary adjustments, or do you think there is actually some permanent closure over there that's giving way to some sustainability in these trend?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We are very optimistic that these are permanent thing, but Corning, you want to make some comments?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. I think that the underlying megatrend in China and their approach to steel and all of that is going to continue. I do think it could be a little bit bouncy between now and then and especially, let's say, in some of the wholesale business areas. Of course, we're moving more towards retail. But I think the underlying mega-trend is going to be sustained for some time.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","It's going to be good for us.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, David. How are you these days?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, thank you. Seifi, just on your 2018 guidance, I believe that you're looking for a $0.65 EPS increase at the midpoint. Do you have an earnings bridge to get from 2017 to 2018 for the $0.65?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","David, the Air Products used to do that, I told them to stop that, because we don't want to give too much information to our competitors. But basically, what is that $0.65, that $0.65 consists of productivity that we will continue to deliver. It will consist of new plants coming on-stream, which is not a lot if you exclude Lu'An. And then it will come from what we believe will be some modest growth in volumes and some modest growth in pricing. And then you add all of that up and come up with the $0.63. We obviously feel very confident that they can deliver that; otherwise we wouldn't put it in our guidance. But those are the key elements, but we don't break it down anymore as we used to do.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very clear, and just on capital deployment Seifi, you know it's a \u2013 you know, you can't discuss it all happens. But is it more likely to be second half \u2013 first half and second half or vice versa in terms of when the next project or two might be announced for that $1 billion-plus of deployments?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, what do you want me to say David?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","First, I'd like to say first half.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We're trying. Okay, thanks.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. You had this price increase announcement about a month ago when your North American merchant business in the 10% to 20% range. Can you just comment on what's the average term of your North American merchant contracts, and therefore the percentage that might be up for renewal in any given year? And do you see this market tight enough for that to flow through upon contract renewal, or the risk of losing some of these accounts?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Corning will answer that. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, so let me speak about the term and then be a little more coy on the pricing just because I think of the competitive situation there. So, the term typically is five years, so you can think of about 20% of it coming up in any given year. Different contracts have different clauses in it, some get rolled before the five-year-period is up and so forth. So I would just say we work pricing hard, and that announcement is part of our overall pricing program, but I'd really not like to go into specifics around that.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then one for you Seifi. One of your long-term plans was just a culture change at Air Products. How would you assess where you are at now? Do you see more to go there or has there been a sufficient amount of change in the overall company organization?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, on that front, I'm obviously pleased with the improvements that we have made, but I think there is more room to go. As I always tell our people, I'm happy where we are, but I'm never going to be satisfied. Whatever we are we can do even better than that. I think the people have responded very well. I'm very proud of the team. I always say that I'm very, quite honestly, very proud and honored to be part of this team. But there is still room to go. We have 15,000 people in this company and to claim that we have reached every one of them with the new culture would be an exaggeration.","So, we do have more work to do, but we have made a lot of progress and I think the best example of that is our safety record because that we need the participation of all of the 15,000 people. And obviously, our financial performance. And it's not easy to improve the EBITDA margin of a company like Air Products, the size of Air Products, by 900 basis points in three years unless you had the full cooperation and support of all of the people. So I thank them for that. But as I said, there's always more room to go.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, John.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","As the Jazan equipment sales ramped down, and with LNG at a low level, does it make sense to roll the global segment at some point into the regional segments and maybe take out some more overhead?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","No, the global thing is just what we report. It's not a different sector that somebody is running with their staff or anything, John. That's just how we report it to you, because I did not want to allocate corporate overhead to the regions. So that, it stands out and you can take a look at it and we can challenge it every day. But it's not an organization that if we kind of roll it into other things we would save any money.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, I withdraw the question then. Any opportunities for Air Products to own 100% of Jazan? I mean, it seems like Saudi Arabia is more in a monetization mode as a country and obviously Air Products is in an investment mode here. Is that a possibility or you don't see that down the road?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, the thing is that if the 75% of Jazan that we don't own was owned by the Government of Saudi Arabia. I think we might have an argument on that. But the 75% that we do not own is owned by a private company, ACWA Energy, and they like Jazan as much as we do. So, unless we are willing to go and offer them a very high price, I think they like where they are. And certainly that company is a very strong company, and they are not suffering from cash. So, I think the possibility is very low, John.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.

Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah, I agree.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Roughly flat to this year.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","About $400 million.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Hey, Mike, how are you these days?","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Doing well. Thank you. Corning, can you quantify what was the hydrogen growth in the Americas and maybe give a little bit more color on the impact that the hurricane had. Was it all just lost volume or did you end up getting some unusual spot sales because competitors may have been out or people needed hydrogen in unusual places?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Mike, this is Seifi. I am certain that Corning can quantify exactly what the growth in hydrogen was, but he is not going to do that, because we don't want to give that information away. I'm sure you understand that, Mike, right?","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Understood. And then I was wondering if you could comment on the progress that you're making in replacing the merchant revenue that was related to Airgas, just kind of update on what kind of impact you expect from the loss of that business and the timing of when it hits you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","That was a contract where we were not making a lot of money on it. So I'm not sure there was a huge loss on that. But, Corning, you want to \u2013 I don't think we're going to quantify anything for you, but Corning do you want to make any general comment?","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. So, we're working hard to replace that volume and we've had modest volume growth, as I talked about earlier, in terms of LOX, LIN and LAR and so we continue to work that. You'll see a full quarter impact of that next quarter.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","And we have taken that into consideration...","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Absolutely.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","...obviously when we gave you our guidance.","Corning F.

Can you characterize bidding activity and in particular whether the Lu'An JV returns are comparable to what you're seeing on new bids or if they're above average?","And secondly, with reference to your discussion about hydrogen cars, are you seeing any shift, particularly in Europe, about carbon taxes and therefore renewed interest in your technology around Carbon Capture?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","With respect to Lu'An, I mean, we have told you that the Lu'An returns are \u2013 we don't take any projects less than 10%, so Lu'An is higher than that. With respect to Carbon Capture in Europe, we are seeing some legislation, but I think Corning is very informed on this thing; he can give you an answer. Go ahead.","Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Let me just say, just a few weeks ago I was in Europe talking with a major customer about a Carbon Capture project.

Please go ahead.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products fourth quarter 2018 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number 2. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. For the quarter and the year, the talented, committed, and motivated team at Air Products delivered another excellent set of safety and financial results. Our full year adjusted earnings per share of $7.45 is up 18%. This is the highest annual EPS in Air Products' history and our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth.","Our record quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2 is up $0.14 versus last year. I'd like to remind everybody that this is the 18th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year quarterly earnings per share growth. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with an EBITDA margin of about 35%. We have the strongest financial position in our industry. This allows us to continue to commit a significant amount of capital to grow Air Products into the future. We generated over $10 per share of distributable cash flow this year and returned about 40% of that or almost $900 million to our investors via dividend.","Our team continues to prove their ability to execute the largest and most complex projects in the history of our industry, successfully completing mega projects in India, Saudi Arabia, China and the United States. And most importantly, we have a great team of dedicated, talented and committed people at Air Products who stay focused on working hard every day to serve our customers and create value for our shareholders.","Now, please turn to slide number 3. We continue to improve our safety results with a reduction of 75% in our lost time injury rate and a reduction of 50% in our recordable injury rate. These results can only happen when all of our 15,000 employees around the world are committed to safety and continuous improvement.","On slide number 4, you can see our goal for the company to be the safest, most diverse, and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers.","Now, please turn to slide number 5. You can see our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times over the last four years. But it is worth repeating because we continue to be focused on shareholder value, capital allocation, and un-empowered and decentralized organization.","Now, please turn to slide number 6. This is our updated Five-Point Plan that I have shared with you last quarter. We remain focused on sustaining our lead in safety and operational performance. We see tremendous opportunities to deploy capital in value-creating projects in our core industrial gas business primarily in our onsite business. Scott will take you through the numbers, but let me provide you a quick overview of our progress.","In fiscal year 2018, we have spent about $1.5 billion on just the growth projects including M&A. In addition, we have more than $6 billion remaining to spend on our already committed future investment opportunity. You have heard Scott and I emphasized many times that we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted Aa2 rating. At that rating, we believe we have almost $14 billion remaining available to invest, including debt capacity today and investible cash flow over the next four years. So, we have already spent or committed about half of the total $15 billion available over the next five-year period of fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2022. This is great progress so far and I remain very confident, and I repeat, very confident of our ability to deploy the rest of this capital into high-return industrial gas projects that generate significant value for our shareholders.","The fourth point of our plan is to continue to further improve our 4S culture, meaning safety, simplicity, speed, and self-confidence. And we are working to create an environment that our committed and motivated team brings that positive attitude and open minds to work every day.","And finally, we do have a higher purpose to create an open and diverse environment for all of our people so that everyone feels that they belong and their contribution is valued. Let me be clear. This is Air Products' Five-Point Plan and remained and we remain focused on executing this strategy regardless of what others may do in our industry. Our goal is not to be the biggest but to be the best industrial gas company.","Now, please turn to slide number 7 for a summary of our fiscal year accomplishments. I want to thank the very hardworking teams who have successfully executed some of the largest projects in the history of our industry. We completed the first year of operation of the large industrial gas complex for BPCL refinery in Kochi, India. This project took more than 10 million man hours to build and we did this without any safety incidents. The facility has successfully supplied hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and steam that enables BPCL to produce cleaner fuels.","With this critical milestone as the largest air separation unit project in the history of our industry attained mechanical completion. The Jazan, Saudi Arabia air separation unit complex was completed with zero lost time injuries in 25 million man hours of work, a tremendous accomplishment by the team, particularly given the remote location and local climate challenges. Just to put that in context for you, that is equivalent to over 1,000 people working over 10 years with no lost time injury. We expect the six air separation units to come on stream in 2019.","We successfully closed and started up the Lu'An, China air separation unit and gasifier joint venture, which has successfully been supplying syngas to Lu'An for their chemical production. The plant is fully operational, with all four gasifiers in service. This is a great accomplishment for our China team and I congratulate and thank them for a job well done.","In June, we held the ribbon cutting event for our new world-class steam methane reformer in Baytown, Texas that provides CO and hydrogen to Covestro and other customers along our Gulf Coast pipeline network. It's great to see these projects starting up and contributing to our growth. But most importantly, it demonstrates to our customers and our employees that Air Products can be counted on to successfully deliver on our commitments, safely building and operating large complicated projects that provide critical gas supply to our customers.","Our proven reliability and successful execution of these projects helped us to win additional projects in China, Korea, India, Louisiana and Texas for customers in the electronics, chemical and manufacturing markets. One of these is for Eastman in Kingsport, Tennessee, where we have been successfully supplying oxygen and nitrogen to their coal gasifiers for 35 years. We continue to commit to world-class engineering and technology resources where we need them around the world including Saudi Arabia, India and China. These are in addition to our existing engineering and technology capabilities in the U.S., U.K. and China.","And in January, we announced a $0.15 dividend increase, the largest in the company's history. This 16% increase marks the 36th consecutive year Air Products has increased our dividend. In fiscal year 2018, we shared about 40% of our distributed cash flow or about $900 million with our investors via the dividend. And with our focus on creating our own growth opportunities, we continue to successfully execute on our gasification strategy.","So please turn to the next slide, slide number 8. Gasification is a process that has been in existence for many years and Air Products has been involved in this market for many years. The process basically use oxygen plus coal, liquids or natural gas to produce synthetic gas which is in a combination of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This syngas can then be used to produce chemicals, diesel fuel, high-end olefins, polymers, hydrogen and\/or power.","Gasification has significant benefits that it enables an environmentally friendly way to use lower value feedstocks. Over the last few years, Air Products was successful in building very large air separation units to provide oxygen to customers operating their gasifiers in China and Saudi Arabia. Over the last year, we announced four large projects where Air Products will own and operate the gasifiers and syngas clean-up, and provide syngas or related products to our customers. The key is that these projects are consistent with our onsite business model, then we don't take any raw material or product volume or price risk. First, I mentioned the Lu'An project that is successfully supplying syngas to Lu'An for their chemical production. Second, in August, we announced the $8 billion gasifier power project in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, the same site where we just finished building the world's largest air separation unit complex. This project continues to move forward, and we continue to expect onstream late in calendar year 2019.","Third, we continue to make great progress on the $3.5 billion air separation unit gasifier project to provide syngas to Yankuang in Shaanxi Province. We expect our ownership of the joint venture to be 55% to 60% with the project expected onstream in 2022. And finally, we also announced an agreement for the first 100% Air Products gasifier project to provide syngas to Juitai in China expected onstream in 2022. A key aspect of our strategy is the critical gasification technology.","Please turn to slide number 9 for an overview of Air Products two gasification technologies. We have already seen the benefits of our acquisition and joint venture for the Shell solid and liquid gasification technology. This is the same technology being used in the Lu'An and Jazan gasifiers. This is a very well-proven technology with hundreds of gasifiers built over the last few decades. Another accompaniment is our recent announcement yesterday to acquire the GE gasification business and technology. The GE gasifier technology was originally developed by Texaco and also hundreds of units built over the last few years. We view these technologies as complementary. There are specific feedstock and product situation for which one technology or the other is better suited. These are technology acquisitions that put us in a better position to win the very large gasification onsite projects in the future.","Now, please turn to slide number 10 which shows the results of our three key metrics for the quarter. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three key metrics.","Now, please go to slide number 11, which has always been my favorite slide, showing that approximately 1,000 basis points improvement in our EBITDA margin in the last four years.","Finally, please turn to slide number 12. Over the last four years, I have stressed the fact that we are committed to deliver at least 10% per year growth in our EPS over the long-term. You can see that we have actually delivered 14% compounded annual growth over the last four years. And this year, we delivered 18% growth. We will continue to execute our strategy that we believe will drive our EPS by at least 10% per year on average over the coming years.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, Seifi. Now, please turn to slide 13 for our full year results from continuing operations. Sales of almost $9 billion increased 9% versus last year, primarily on 6% higher volumes and 1% higher price. We saw strong volume increases across all three regions, partially offset by lower activity from the Jazan project in Global Gases. Excluding Jazan, volumes were up 10%, with about half from new plants. Versus last year, pricing was up 1% primarily driven by our China and Europe merchant businesses. Positive currency was driven by the euro, British pound and the Chinese RMB.","EBITDA of over $3.1 billion improved by 11%, driven by the higher volumes, positive pricing, currency, and equity affiliate income, partially offset by higher costs. Record EBITDA margin of 34.9% was up 70 basis points. Record adjusted earnings per share of $7.45 was up 18% versus prior year. ROCE of 12.4% improved 30 basis points versus last year. The impact on ROCE of our profit improvement is still moderated by the larger denominator which increased as a result of the gain from the PMD sale in early 2017. The FY 2018 denominator has the PMD gain in all five quarters, while FY 2017 only has three quarters with the PMD gain.","Please turn to slide 14. Our record adjusted full year continuing operations EPS of $7.45 increased by $1.14 per share. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.71 per share. Price and raw materials taken together increased EPS by $0.16. Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.45 as productivity was again offset by a few factors, including inflation, planned maintenance costs, and the end of the cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 capture project. We also continue to see higher costs in strategic areas focused on pursuing exciting growth opportunities.","Currency and foreign exchange was $0.16 favorable primarily due to the euro, British pound, and the Chinese RMB. Equity affiliate income added $0.15 primarily due to underlying operational strength in Mexico and Italy. The overall tax rate was a $0.44 benefit versus last year with about $0.33 from the new Tax Act. For both fiscal year 2019 and Q1 FY 2019, we expect a tax rate of about 20%.","Finally, we had other items that combined for a positive $0.02. This includes $0.08 from higher non-operating income primarily from higher interest income. This was somewhat offset by $0.03 higher interest and a $0.03 impact from higher shares outstanding.","Now, please turn to slide 15. We had a very strong cash flow year with over $10 per share or $2.2 billion of distributable cash flow which is up over $300 million from prior year. From a $2.2 billion of distributable cash flow, we paid almost $900 million or about 40% as dividends. Even with this robust dividend, we still have over $1.3 billion available for high-return investments in our core industrial gas business.","Slide number 16 provides an update on our capital deployment, as Seifi previously mentioned. We are making it easier for investors to understand how much we have spent, how much we have committed, and how much remained of our capital deployment capacity. The first point is that we are tracking capital deployment over the five-year period of FY 2018 through FY 2022.","As you can see, we spent about $1.5 billion on growth projects including M&A but excluding maintenance capital. In addition, we have committed but not yet spent almost $6.5 billion on projects in M&A. You've heard both Seifi and I emphasized many times the importance of managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted Aa2 rating. If we maintain this rating at a debt level of about 3 times the last 12 months EBITDA, we have about $8.5 billion available to invest today. And based on the last 12 months investable cash flow, we expect to have at least $5.5 billion over the next four years. Therefore, in total, we have almost $14 billion remaining to invest. The $1.5 billion we have spent this year and the $14 billion available gives us over $15 billion of total available capacity from FY 2018 through FY 2022. So, you can see we have spent about 10% and committed about half of the total available capacity.","Turning to slide 17, I'll make a few comments on our quarterly results. Sales of $2.3 billion increased 4% versus last year as volumes are up 3% and price contributed 1%. We saw strong volume increases in Americas and Asia, partially offset by lower activity from the Jazan project in Global Gases. Excluding Jazan, volumes were up 6%, with about 3% from new plants primarily driven by the Lu'An project. Versus last year, pricing impacted our overall sales by a positive 1% primarily driven by China. Pricing changes are driven by our merchant business where we saw a 3% increase.","EBITDA of $822 million improved by 7% driven by the higher volumes and equity affiliate income, partially offset by higher costs. EBITDA margin of 35.8% was up 90 basis points driven by the higher volume. Record adjusted quarterly continuing operations EPS of $2 per share was up 14% versus prior year.","Please turn to slide 18. Our adjusted EPS of $2 increased by $0.24. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.23 per share. Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.16, as productivity was again offset by a few factors. In addition to the ones that I had mentioned during my full year comments, we also saw higher supply chain costs in the Americas and Asia.","Equity affiliate income added $0.04 primarily due to the underlying operating strength in Mexico and Italy. The overall tax rate was a $0.15 benefit versus last year. You can also see we had several non-GAAP items that totaled to $0.05 benefit for the quarter. These included a pension settlement, a valuation change due to a change in inventory accounting policy, and a few tax reform related items.","Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to slide number 19 Gases Asia where we continue to deliver strong sales and profit growth, thanks to the efforts of our excellent and committed team in Asia. Sales increased 15% versus last year driven by very strong volume growth and higher prices. Volumes were up 14%, with new projects there driving about 10% of the increase, while base business and acquisitions are roughly equal to the rest.","Lu'An was a significant contributor this quarter responsible for about half of the total sales growth. Pricing for the region was up 3% versus last year, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement. This also marked a 2% sequential increase from the prior quarter showing the continuing strength in this region's merchant market primarily in China. Strong base volumes, the addition of Lu'An and favorable pricing drove profits and margins higher.","EBITDA increased over 20% and EBITDA margin improved 210 basis points compared to prior year. Consistent with our prior guidance, Lu'An contributed about $0.04 of EPS this quarter. As I said, we are pleased that all four gasifier trains have come on stream and expect Lu'An to contribute more than $0.25 earnings per share in fiscal year 2019. We continue to believe that our business in China will improve in the coming year, and we have not seen any negative impact as a result of the imposed tariffs.","Now, I would like to turn the call back to Scott to discuss our Americas results. Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to slide 20 for a review of our Gases Americas results. For the quarter, sales grew 4% on higher volumes and price. Volumes improved 4% as both onsite and merchant volumes were strong. Our new plant in Baytown, Texas supported increased hydrogen demand on the Gulf Coast. Merchant volumes also grew despite the termination of a wholesale contract in Q4 of FY 2017. Overall price was 1% higher which is our first positive pricing result in the last six quarters. Americas EBITDA was roughly equal to prior year as improved volume and price, as well as higher equity affiliate income due to better results in Mexico were offset by increased costs. While we did have positive productivity, this was more than offset by higher power costs, and we no longer have the cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 capture project. We saw higher transportation costs in part due to driver shortages.","Finally, the difficult business environment in South America negatively impacted our ability to collect from certain customers. As a result, EBITDA margin was down 160 basis points. Sequentially, sales and EBITDA both improved 4%. Strong volumes grew higher sales and EBITDA was further supported by lower cost as maintenance activities were lower this quarter.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to slide 21 for a review of our Gases EMEA results. Sales were up 8% primarily driven by a 7% higher energy pass-through mostly due to a significant increase in natural gas prices in India. Volumes contributed a positive 2% due to merchant growth as well as recent acquisitions. Higher merchant pricing added another 1%. Improved merchant markets lifted both price and volume in our packaged gases and liquid bulk businesses. As a reminder, the India plant was fully on stream in Q4 last year so there was no year-over-year benefit in Q4 this year.","EBITDA declined 5% as unfavorable currency and higher cost negated the positive pricing effect and better equity affiliate performance in Italy. Power costs in Europe have risen sharply during the quarter and our team is working hard to recover these higher costs through pricing actions. EBITDA margin was 31.4%, a drop of 410 basis points. Excluding the impact of higher energy pass-through, EBITDA margin was down 180 basis points primarily due to the higher power costs. Sequentially, EBITDA margin was down but would have been nearly flat excluding the higher energy pass-through.","Now, please turn to slide 22 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. EBITDA was flat although sales were down due to lower project activity as we approach the conclusion of the Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. We continue to expect the Jazan ASU project on stream in phases in fiscal 2019. But we do expect the Jazan ASU overall to be a headwind for FY 2019 versus FY 2018.","Now, please turn to slide 23 for a brief comment on our Corporate segment which includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our corporate costs. Sales increased modestly compared to prior year as we began to see renewed interest in LNG projects. Overall segment profit was up due to additional equipment sales and lower costs. We continue to be optimistic about the future prospects for the LNG business but only anticipate a modest earnings improvement in FY 2019.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Simon. Our team around the world, all of us, continued to be very excited about Air Products future. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation for our continued growth. And our Five-Point Plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward.","As I said before, we have the financial capacity, the opportunities and the team to successfully win key growth projects. There is no doubt that there is uncertainty in the world. I guess that's an understatement. And while we cannot predict or control worldwide political or economic developments, we do have control over the operational performance and growth of Air Products and we are confident we will continue to deliver on the commitments that we have made.","Let me address what we are seeing relative to global trade relationships and tariffs. Very simply, we have not, and I stress, not seen any material impact on Air Products at this point. Our business is local so we don't have any direct exposure to import\/export tariffs. Also, we have not seen customers changing their behavior or attitude toward us and we have not seen any impact on our major projects or interaction with customers in the different parts of the world.","Now, please turn to slide number 24. We are all working hard every day to be the safest, most diverse, and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Our guidance for fiscal year 2019 is for a range of $8.05 to $8.30. At midpoint, our guidance represents 10% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance. As I said, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment to grow EPS by more than 10% per year on average in the future.","For quarter one of fiscal year 2019, our earnings per share guidance is $1.85 to $1.90. At midpoint, up 5% over last year. But I would like to remind you that in quarter one of fiscal year 2018, there was an $0.08 benefit from a plant sale in Asia that will not repeat. Excluding this item, our quarter one guidance is up 10% versus prior year. We expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2019. We expect the Jazan gasification power joint venture to close late in calendar 2019, so we have not included this in our fiscal 2019 CapEx forecast. You can also see we have about $7 billion of commitments including projects and M&A. This is up significantly as it now includes the Jazan, Yankuang, Juitai gasification projects.","And then, please turn to slide number 25. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. That is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance. I want to thank all of our 15,000 people around the world for their total commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together. And as I always say, I'm very proud to be part of this winning team.","As you know, execution without strategy is aimless and our strategy without execution is worthless. Our Five-Point is our strategy. Our people's execution against this strategy in the years to come will ensure our continued success and value creation.","Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, P.J. How are you this morning?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. In Americas and Europe, the leverage from sales growth doesn't seem to be coming down to the EBITDA line. Last quarter, it was maintenance cost. This quarter, I think you mentioned high power cost. When can we begin to see the leverage flowing to the EBITDA line?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, first of all, you are absolutely correct that the margins are \u2013 kind of the marginal contribution has been coming down. You mentioned the reasons very accurately in Americas which is a combination of a lot of things, hydrogen turnarounds, driver shortages, and a lot of other things that I can delineate for you. And in Europe, we have had a significant issue with power cost that we haven't been able to recover. We are working very hard and we are hoping that we would reverse these trends in 2019.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then quickly on merchant utilization, can you compare them around the world? Now that you are getting pricing in each region, what are we seeing in terms of utilization in each region?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Overall, our utilization in Europe is still around 78%, 79%. In the U.S., it is approximately the same. In China, it obviously differs from different parts of China. There are part of China where our utilization is almost 90% and that is what is helping us to drive the prices up.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, P.J.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","(39:43-39:49) year-over-year variance in how you drove your EPS growth. As we look into 2019, I think you mentioned Jazan would be a headwind. I don't suspect tax will be as big of a tailwind and maybe exiting the fourth quarter of the U.S. and the Americas and EMEA were not that growing so much. So, can you give us a sense of what those buckets would look like that drive that pretty significant EPS growth you see in 2019?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","What, the main reasons \u2013 first of all, good morning, Bob. The main drivers for increasing our EBITDA significantly next year, and as you say, we are suggesting about 10%. But I mean that is actually more than that if you take away the effect of the tax thing. But fundamentally, the drivers are our growth projects that are coming onstream in China, in India, in the U.S. So \u2013 and then, we are hoping that there are some other projects that we haven't announced would materialize. And then in addition to that, we are hoping that the utilization rates will maybe improve slightly in China. I don't know about how it will work out in the U.S. because, as you know, manufacturing in the last six months in the U.S. has actually gone down. And so those are the factors.","And then in addition, Bob, I have to say that I'm not that excited about our performance on cost last year, and I'm hoping that we will have additional productivity and cost improvement programs that would help deliver the results.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And if I might follow up, Seifi, you guys had about a 1% price improvement this year. Can you give us some sense of what you might see in fiscal 2019?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, Bob, first of all, the 1%, I'm sure you know that the 1% is over our total portfolio. So since half of our portfolio is onsites where we don't get any price increase, therefore, the price increase on our merchant side is really 2%. But as far as the future, because of the nature of our industry, I would hesitate to make any comment on that.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you very much, Bob.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff. How are you this morning?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very fine. How do you think the Praxair-Linde merger will change the industrial gas landscape or perhaps will change the opportunities for Air Products in the coming year?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, Jeff, I'm obviously very hesitant to make any comments about other people's business. But as I said during my comments, we do not expect any change in our strategy. We have said that publicly and I recently put out a memo to our own people. We had a strategy, we are executing that strategy and quite frankly, I do not see any change or any reason for change as a result of the merger because the merger hasn't really changed anything. It's just a little bit moving the pieces on the chessboard. So we do not \u2013 and in terms of opportunities, actually, we think that that might enhance opportunities for us because usually, there is a customer who was going to divide their business by four, giving each one of us 25%, now, they will divide it by three, and therefore, we will get more share and the other guys will get less share. So, we actually think that overall, as I said, no change in terms of what we do and if anything, it's slightly positive.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Can you compare what you've paid for the GE technology business to what you've paid for that Shell business? And what are the annual revenues of the GE business and what were the annual revenues of the Shell business?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, on both of those things, we have an agreement with both Shell and GE not to disclose those numbers. I would have not minded disclosing them, but they don't want to do that. And in terms of what we paid for them, let's just say a general thing, that's approximately similar.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Seifi said before, the value creation of those acquisitions is much more about the ability to be in a better position for the big onsite projects than the specifics associated with the technology licensing revenues.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Absolutely. Because we bought the business for \u2013 and the Shell business, the acquisition of that has given us significant advantage in knowing the future projects that might happen. So, that has been a very successful thing, and I'm very happy that we've been able to reach an agreement with GE. It took a very long time. But they have an excellent technology, it's the former Texaco technology. I'm very familiar with that. I was trying to promote that in the 1990s with Foster Wheeler to try to get BOC in that business, but that didn't happen. So, I'm very pleased that we were able to acquire that. Thank you, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We will take our next question from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. On the GE gasification business, I guess when you think about how much it potentially expands your addressable market, is that the right way to think about it. And if it is, how much does that help when you kind of bundle that in with the Shell platform as well?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","First of all, good morning, John. And secondly, it almost doubles because GE and Shell technologies are approximately equal weight in terms of what is being used. And therefore, it literally doubles the exposure that we have and our ability to promote that technology. And obviously, if we have the technology for a gasifier, our chances of building and owning and operating that gasifier significantly increases.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks. And then just a question, you had announced a couple of \u2013 I guess a couple of new projects during the quarter, the Kingsport facilities and also the, I believe, it was liquid helium platform as well. I guess can you help us to understand how to think about the earnings power on those? I guess the ones tied to Eastman sounds like they're more replacement project, so if you can kind of help us to think about how to quantify that that would be helpful.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure, John. And John, first of all, Eastman coal gasification project, it is more than replacement. It is actually \u2013 there is some additional volumes that they will need. But that will contribute to our earnings about two years from now once \u2013 after we have built the plant. And in terms of the other things, we also announced Juitai, which is a big project about $600 million investment and that is going to come on stream on 2021.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Vincent. How are you?","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm very well. Thank you, Seifi. Another question on the GE gasification technology, the slide talks about adaptable to a wide range of feedstocks. Maybe you could just help us understand sort of what the principal wide range of feedstocks is in there and maybe again how that expands your palate?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","The principal applications on that is in coal and natural gas gasification. They have an excellent technology for that. And the technology is related to the quality of the coal, the ash content of the coal whether you use a slurry system and all that. And that is why we were keen to have both Shell and GE because then we can tailor make it to the specific situation that the customers have.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up, you're referencing South America an inability to collect on payments. Is that a function of customers being below minimum take or pay or is that a separate type of issue?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","It's just the issue of some customers going bankrupt...","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Ah, okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","...which have been plenty of them.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","And our merchant business (48:42)","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We have very little onsite down South America.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Right.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. So, you've recently been seeing more positive in projects in the U.S. and India and always the Middle East for obvious reasons. But just given the remaining plus or minus $8.5 billion left to deploy over the next few years in these projects and these geographies, are the recent acquisitions, I mean obviously Shell and GE were both very intentional. Are they complementary and is there anything that you're attempting to triangulate for the ongoing bidding processes of these potential projects, or are there other technologies you still feel you would need to acquire?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, I don't want to comment on the second part but first of all, good morning, Chris.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Second thing is that when you look at the GE technology, GE technology has been chosen actually for some very big projects in India. Some of it has been publicly announced. So that, I think, is giving us an opportunity. And then obviously, we are looking forward to deploying some of these for projects in the U.S., absolutely.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And just given the volatility of the electricity rates in Europe and just broadly, can you just give us the puts and takes of the merchant market and kind of how you're thinking about that not only over the next quarter but over the next year and what you're hearing from your team there? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, the thing is that our teams are obviously optimistic but they are in no position to predict what happens to Brexit or what happens to the elections tonight in the U.S. So we are at the mercy of industrial production. GDP really doesn't mean very much to our business because it includes financial activity and people going out to dinner. We are focused on industrial production and that we have given you the guidance on the basis of \u2013 they have been a little bit conservative. We don't see significant improvements. So now, if for some magic reason things significantly improve, we'll benefit from that but we have been on the cautious side.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. This is Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Seifi, could you maybe expand on the synergies of having both GE and Shell's gasification technology and what I mean by that is in your mind, does having both technologies provide you with a meaningful bidding advantage versus saying having one or the other so, sort of a one-plus-one-equals-three-type equation? Just how should we think about the complementary nature of these?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, just think of a situation, if there are 10 projects and half of them are using Shell and half of them are using GE, by owning the GE technology, now we have an opportunity to participate in all 10 rather than 5 of them. So, it is complementary, and it does expand our scope. It's actually a very positive thing, Mike.","Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Scott, could you just remind us on how the P&L impact shifts for the Jazan ASUs as the project is complete and we start to ramp that up in 2019?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","So, yes. Thanks for the question. So, in terms of Jazan, two parts, there's the SOE that we've been doing over the last couple of years. That's \u2013 as Seifi mentioned I think in the prepared remarks, that's wrapping up here in the next year. And so, you'll see that as a headwind and again, I think Seifi addressed that earlier. Then, our 25% that we own for the long-term supply contract is going to be an equity affiliate, and it's going to be a very, very small contribution. So, not much in there going forward from that portion of the Jazan opportunity.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Can I just add? But that is for the air separation unit part. That means basically, we are saying that you are not going to see a lot of \u2013 actually, you're going to see a headwind from the air separation part in 2019. But the gasifier part is the big part and that one is going to be a significant contribution in 2020 after we close it in 2019.","Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Seifi. How are you?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","I'm fine, David. I haven't seen you for a while. How is everything?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. Thank you. Seifi, just looking at your large project activity, could you work around your key regions; China, India, the Middle East, and the U.S., talk about the pace and cadence of activity that you're seeing today?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay. We see significant opportunities still in the U.S. Some of these projects were delayed but there are other projects in the U.S., whether they are methanol projects, whether they are ammonia projects and all of that. We are obviously involved in all of them and I hope they materialize because as you know, our preference, if the opportunities exist, that we would invest all of our $15 billion in the US. I mean that goes without saying, this is the place \u2013 our home base and this is where we want to invest. So we see still opportunities in the U.S.","Then there are significant, and I mean significant opportunities in China. They are \u2013 there's more projects than we can handle quite honestly right now. There is \u2013 starting to have significant opportunities in India because of the change in the law that they had about coal ownership. So a lot of people are participating in that and there was a big announcement about the fertilizer project which is gasification in India and all of that. So we're seeing that.","In Saudi Arabia, you have seen the opportunities and we believe that there will be opportunities in other parts of the world. I don't want to be that specific but the pipeline is pretty robust and with us being on top of both technologies which are the key technologies being used, I think we should have a competitive advantage. Obviously, time will tell and the results will back up what we are claiming, but we remain very optimistic.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And Scott, following up Bob's earlier question on the 2019 earnings bridge, you have about a $0.75 forecast of increase. Could you just, broadly speaking, break out that $0.75 bridge between 2019 and 2018, if possible?","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, we don't give out all the specifics. I think though Seifi in his comments talked about the new on streams, the full year impact, as well as new things coming on stream, and hopefully favorable volume growth and pricing, so forth. Let me add a couple of things. Tax as well as currency. So we see, as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 20% effective tax rate book for next year, which would translate into about a $0.10 headwind. And it's really driven by the absence of some favorable things, some favorable tax audit settlements we had in this year. So, that's part of the bridge into 2019.","The other is currency and we see somewhere on the order of about a $0.10 to $0.15 headwind on currency. And just recall the way that we look at this, we just take the last data points on currency and then just move that sideways through the year as opposed to try to project where rates are going to go. Let me give you, so everybody can have their own view where currency is going to go and again our view is at this point in time it's about $0.10 to $0.15. Let me give you the rules of thumb that you can apply to whatever your own assumptions are. So if we move the RMB by 10% and as always, I want to remind folks this is just mathematics, right? It's just translation. There's no transaction in there.","So, if you move the RMB by 10% that translates into about a $0.12 change for the year. The euro same 10% swing and in exchange would be about $0.09. And then there's a handful of other ones that each of which are about $0.03 to $0.04 that includes the pound and the Korean won, Taiwanese dollar and the Canadian dollar. So, each of those individually if the exchange moves about 10% to be $0.03 to $0.04 on an annual basis and what I've just given there plus the U.S. sales is about 90% of our sales. So, hopefully that's helpful. So, you can put it in your models.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, David.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Would you characterize the number of coal gasification projects under consideration in China including refurbishment of old gasifiers as being in the neighborhood of a few or more likely a few dozen?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","How about like 50?","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And to the extent that the new plants are much more efficient than the old ones, what's the role of the Chinese government in any of these? Are they providing any support financing wise or streamlined regulatory path?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Most of these companies that are doing this are state-owned anyway. So, they are 100% owned by the government. Therefore, as they invest, they obviously have the support of the government.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just lastly, your outlook for incremental demand growth for hydrogen on the U.S. Gulf from IMO 2020?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yes, we expect that. I think that the industry has not acted because they are hoping that they would get some help from the White House and delay the implementation. But I don't know where that will go. But in Europe, people are pretty serious about implementing in that in the rest of the world. And we will, in time, see significant demand but, as I said, it hasn't really happened in the U.S. right now. It will take about three years before this thing \u2013 any new plan comes onstream. And I think most of the people here are thinking that at the end of the day, this will become like the auto emission thing. They wait until the last minute, nobody does anything and then we kind of say, okay, we delay it another four or five years. That's what the industry is hoping but I have no insight in terms of what the administration will do.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Don. How are you doing?","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Very good. Thanks. Couple questions. One, you talked about a slowing base business outlook. I noticed your growth for the full year was 10% ex-Jazan, it slowed to 6% ex-Jazan in Q4. Was that all due to the slowdown in global industrial production? And what's your specific industrial production forecast for your fiscal 2019 guidance?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, the first question \u2013 I think Simon had a quick answer for that.","Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Yeah. Just remember, of course, that we didn't have any year-over-year volume benefit from the big plant in India this quarter and the prior four quarters we did. So that slows the comparator down.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Exactly. So it's the effect of the plant in India coming onstream. So we haven't really seen any slowdown in that respect. In terms of industrial production, Don, I mean you are more of an expert on this than any one of us here. I mean, we can't predict what's going to happen tomorrow. So you can ask me, I mean, what I can answer is that in terms of our guidance, the way we have come up with the guidance is that we have assumed that there will be no significant uptick, but at the same time, no significant downtick. So we are expecting or we are giving you our guidance based on the fact that things will stay about the same. So if there is any significant change up or down, then obviously we'll be affected by that.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And on the cost side, both in Europe with power and North America with supply chain, do you have the ability to surcharge for those two specific items? And if not, how do you expect to address those costs in fiscal 2019?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, we theoretically have the ability and I always every day challenge our people to use that ability and the contractual ability to increase the prices. But it obviously depends on what our competitors do. But those are the challenges that we have to face in 2019. And the way we have given you the guidance is that we have assumed that we will overcome those challenges.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you, Don.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Forget if you mentioned it, but are you a major oxygen supplier to many of these GE gasification locations?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","The existing ones, I think we are by far the most major supplier in terms of sale of gas, yes. But a lot of these projects that I'm talking about in the future obviously they haven't been built. But...","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Right. But how many existing gasifiers do you supply oxygen to?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We supply to about at least eight of them.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Eight?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","But some of them have four or five units, so...","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, eight.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We supply more than 100,000 ton a day of oxygen to these people.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, Praxair-Linde still have some divestments coming post closing assets in Korea and neon in the U.S.. I assume you would not be allowed to bid for those but I just wanted to check.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","We are not counting on it at all. That's correct.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Hey. How are you?","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I am great. Two-part question, if you will. On yet another two on the coal gasification here. I was wondering if this also means a research push from you guys on developing better, more efficient, cleaner, et cetera. And if we could see an uptick in R&D spend as a result.","And then the second question on the same topic here is my understanding was that the GE Shenhua venture was the provider of practically all the GE licensed gasifiers in China. How does that JV fit into with your plans of going into the gasification in China?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Great questions. First of all, your first question. Yes, it does mean that we are going to spend more on R&D. That is one of the reasons that you see a negative costing in 2018 performance. That's very true and we are committed to make sure that we provide the support for these technologies to improve forward. The other thing is that we are now, in China, a partner with Shenhua. That means that the way we bought this thing, we bought all the rights to the GE gasifiers outside China, it's all 100% ours. And in China, we are partner with Shenhua which is now called, China Energy Corporation. So, we are their partners.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. How does that partnership interact with your strategy of becoming the builder\/operator of these gasification units?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","It does significantly help because hopefully, they will bond to those new gasifiers and all of that and now, we are \u2013 I mean China Energy Corporation is one of the largest companies in the world. They are operating about, I think, at least 10 gasifiers in China, most of them do use GE technology, and they have plans for the future. So, we are very, very honored and happy to be a partner with the China Energy Corporation, former Shenhua.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Good morning, Mike. How are you doing today?","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Doing well. Thanks, Seifi. Just going back to the EU, the European power cost situation. You've dealt with this fairly recently in the past, you seem to have managed through it, and now we're getting hit with what you called another surge. Can you quantify how much impact you saw this quarter and is it something that's carrying into Q4 and the fact that you dealt with these cost increases pretty recently, does that make it any easier to maybe pass this through to customers or get additional pricing?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, Mike, it's a very good question. Obviously, power costs are going to go up in Europe because I mean, you pay a price if you want clean energy and you don't want to use a nuclear power plants. Therefore, the cost of renewable energy and all of that is higher. The issue that they have with this power cost and all of that is that when they happen we have a program we understand how to increase prices to recover that which is not easy, but there is a delay factor. So, when it happens in a quarter, we are not going to instantly be able to recover that in the same quarter. So, usually we have an impact on the quarter and then one or two quarters later on, we have increased the prices and we recover that. So, there is a little bit of a phasing here.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Understood. And then another question regarding the competitive environment. You talked a little bit about the change related to four major players now becoming three but we also have had some divestitures to call them somewhat smaller players that are going to make those two competitors a little bit bigger. Do you see them having a significant impact on the \u2013 in particular the merchant gas competitive landscape over the next couple of years?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, again, I mean, what do you want me to say? In terms of competitors, we consider we have two competitors. The rest of them are companies. We don't consider them competitors.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just two quick clarifications. The only capital outlay for the gasification this year will be the Jazan investment. Is that right or more of that $7 billion pipeline get pulled into 2019?","And secondly, just comparing pages 16 and 24, it looks like you're calling out about $600 million of M&A. Is that future M&A related to bolt-ons or the captivation or is that including the gasification acquisitions?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, first of all, with respect to the first question that you had, let me put this thing in context because we are very careful about how we talk about these things. When we talk about M&A, that includes buying a company or it includes the captivation, so we expect that. The second thing is that in terms of spending money, for example, Juitai, we signed the contract last year $600 million. We are going to spend capital on building that plant obviously tomorrow and some other projects that they have won. So, that is why our capital expenditure for next year, we are giving you a guidance of $2 billion to $2.5 billion which is almost $1 billion more than this year, which is spending money on the projects we have won so that they come on stream in 2020 and 2021.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Just to clarify one thing we did say the Jazan gasifier project is not included in our capital guidance. As Seifi said, we expect that to close late in 2019.And just one more point to make too is that on one of the slides, we're showing the remaining capital to spend on our commitments and the other one we're showing the total amount. So, I think that's the difference that you're talking about there.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Laurence. Okay. And we have time for one more question. Yeah.","Operator","Perfect. We'll take our last question from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Peter Osterland - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. This is Pete Osterland on for Jim.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Hi.","Peter Osterland - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","In Asia, you called out volume growth from Lu'An as well as pricing strength in the merchant market. And I'm just trying to size, can you estimate how much of the EBITDA margin uplift that you experienced during the quarter was due to each of these?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, the thing is that we said that half of our growth \u2013 I mean we have specifically said that Lu'An contributed $0.04 to our bottom line. So, that's about $12 million approximately.","Peter Osterland - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","And then merchant growth is basically \u2013 then we had some other projects coming on stream in addition to Lu'An. And then the merchant volume was about maybe 40% of the increase.","Peter Osterland - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.","Well, with that, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call.

And welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals' First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Simon Moore","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2018 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and in today's earnings release.","Beginning this quarter, we adopted the new pension accounting standard. Adopting this accounting standard is required for all companies, we chose to adopt earlier than many. This new accounting standard does not impact pension or overall cost, or earnings per share but it does move the impact of non-service related pension costs to other non-operating income and expense.","For FY17, this resulted in modest increase in operating income and EBITDA of about $4 million and increases margins by 10 basis points. This change provides a better reflection of our operating performance by moving the historically more volatile components of pension expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of deferred amounts to non-operating.","Service cost remain in operating income as these represent the benefits earned in the current period by planned purchase events. Again, just to emphasize, this doesn\u2019t change our pension and overall cost we just moved to small component of cost from within operating income to non-operating income. We view this updated historical information for prior period comparisons and the results reported today, and you can find a summary in an appendix slide and more detailed consolidated and segment information in the 8-K we filed today.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.","Our talented and committed Air Products team delivered another excellent quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, our record earning per share of $1.79 was up 22% versus last year. This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year EPS growth. This is also the third consecutive quarter we have delivered EPS growth of more than 15%. We generated strong cash flow and are pleased to announce a dividend increase of 15% per share or 16%, the largest per share increase in our history. Our annual dividend is now $4.40 per share, which equals to returning almost $1 billion per year to our shareholders.","We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with EBITDA margin of over 33%. And most importantly, we have a great team, totally focused on delivering strong operating performance, while successfully winning exciting new growth opportunities.","Now please turn to slide number three. You can see the significant progress we continue to make on improving our safety results with a reduction of 71% in our lost time injury rate and a reduction of 52% in our recordable injury rate. This improvement only happens when all of our 15,000 employees around the world are totally focused on safety and operational excellence. This same commitment is also driving our strong financial performance.","Now please turn to slide number four, which is our goal for the company. As I shared on last quarter's call, we have elevated our commitment to diversity and inclusion by explicitly incorporating it in our goal. This does not dilute our focus on being the safest and most profitable. In fact, being the most diverse will contribute to maintaining our position as the most profitable industrial gas company over the long term.","As I've always said, the degree of commitment and motivation of our people is the real sustainable competitive advantage that we have. We want to ensure that we are providing opportunities and the right environment for everyone to contribute and succeed in our company, regardless of their gender, color, race, religion, orientation, country of origin or any other dimension of diversity.","Now please turn to slide number five. Our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times. We continue to be focused on shareholder value, cash generation, capital allocation and an empowered and decentralized organization. On the slide number six, you can see our five point plan, which has been the roadmap to our success.","Now please turn to slide number seven, where I would like to again remind everyone of the progress we have made in the last three years. We made promises and we have delivered. We have become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have divested our non-core assets and created the best balance sheet in the industry, and we have delivered greater than 10% per year EPS growth in each of the last three years, and our guidance for this year implies another year of over 10% growth.","Now please turn to slide number eight. In summary, we have delivered what we promised and now we are well positioned to grow Air Products. The great thing is that we do have the balance sheet to do it.","Now please turn to slide number nine to discuss the areas of opportunity for us to invest and move Air Products forward. First, acquisition of small and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets for businesses from other industrial gas companies. The second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers, where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee under a long term contract. This is what we call asset buybacks and we see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category.","We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units, to supply syngas to our customers based on long term contracts. Essentially, these opportunities is the same as our traditional onsite business model, something that we do every day, but with existing rather than new production assets. The Lu'An project we described before is a perfect example of this area of growth for us. We expect to do more of these in the coming years.","And the third area of opportunity is very large industrial projects around the world, driven by demand for more energy, environmental requirements and energy market growth. The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these opportunities can be. The plant we are building in Jazan is the largest project in the history of the industrial gas industry, with close to $2 billion of capital investment. Some of these new large projects that I am talking about can also include gasification and syngas supply. The Yankuang project that we announced is another great example of that.","Now please turn to slide number 10 to discuss some of the -- or read some of our recent successes to grow Air Products in line with what I just described, which is consistent with our strategy. First, the tremendous opportunity for Air Products to expand our well proven onsite business model to supply syngas, and we have some great recent examples. In September, we announced the 1.3 billion Lu'An syngas joint venture. We continue to make progress on the necessary approvals and hope we can close on this joint venture at some point during fiscal year '18.","However, as we did in October, due to some uncertainty in the timing of the necessary government approvals, we have not, and I'd like to stress, we have not included any contribution from Lu'An project in our EPS or CapEx guidance for fiscal year '18. We will continue to keep you updated on our progress.","In November, we announced $3.5 billion syngas joint venture with Yankuang in China. We also continue to make progress on finalizing the contract, and we'll keep you updated. And earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Shell's coal gasification technology supporting our syngas supply position and supporting our strategy in this area. Finally, earlier to speak, we announced an agreement to supply syngas to BPCL\u2019s phase 2 petrochemical project in Kochi, India. Our new facility will be integrated with the large plant we brought on stream in 2017 to supply their refinery.","In terms of acquiring assets and plans for the so called asset buyback that we have been talking about, in December, we announced an ASU asset buyback on long term industrial gas supply agreements for Jinmei Huayu in China. A great example of a customer becoming more comfortable with the outsourcing sale of gas model. And we recently signed and closed on another deal to acquire three existing large air suppression unit assets in China, and have began supplying customers and their long-term agreements.","And finally, we continue to see great opportunities in the new industrial gas projects around the world. We announced new projects in China and Korea. Notably, these include major contracts expanding our supply to two of Samsung\u2019s major sites in Korea. Finally, we continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and currently expect on stream in phases starting in fiscal year 2019.","As I mentioned, yesterday we announced the largest dividend increase in Air Products\u2019 history, continuing our commitment to retain cash to shareholders.","Now please go to slide number 11, which shows you the results of our three key metrics for the quarter and the year. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three key metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvements as we move forward. Finally, please turn to slide number 12, which continues to be my favorite side. It is great to see sustainable margins in the mid 30% range and it reminds us how far we have come in only a few years.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon, to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you, very much Seifi. Before I discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to provide a brief summary of the impacts we expect the U.S. Tax Cuts in Jobs Act to have on Air Products.","Please turn to slide 13. First, let me talk about the income statement impact for Q1. Although, the reduced U.S. tax rate under the new tax act was not affected until January 1, 2018, which is after the end of our fiscal Q1, this quarter's results reflect our estimated blended tax rate for the full year as required.","Overall, the new tax act reduced our tax rate in Q1 by about 260 basis points, which increased EPS by about $0.06 per share. As you can see, the positive impact of the lower U.S. tax rate was partially offset by other tax act changes, including reduced benefits from the U.S. production activities deduction and changes to compensation deductions. For the full year 2018, we expect the new tax act to reduce our tax rate by about 250 basis points to 300 basis points to somewhere in the range of about 20% to 21%. This would increase EPS by about $0.20 per share to $0.25 per share.","For fiscal year 2019, we expect a similar net impact as the full year effect of the lower U.S. rate is approximately offset by the repeal of the U.S. production activities deduction, and credits for foreign taxes and other changes that takes effect in 2019. So I would use about a 20% to 21% book effective tax rate to model Air Products going forward.","Turning now to the tax related non-GAAP items this quarter that totaled a negative $239 million or $1.09 per share. Please keep in mind these are based on our current reasonable estimates. We had a charge of $453 million to recognize the liability associated with the deemed repatriation of the foreign earnings, with about $32 million recorded in equity affiliate income. The deemed repatriation tax will be paid over the next eight years. Partially offsetting the charge, we had a benefit of $214 million due to revaluing our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower tax rate.","Finally, let me comment on the expected cash tax impact. There was no cash tax impact in Q1. For full year 2018, we expect a modest reduction in cash taxes from the new tax act of about $15 million to $20 million as the benefit from the lower corporate tax rate is mostly offset by the tax on the expected repatriation of foreign cash from subsidiaries and joint ventures. So we would still expect cash taxes in the range of about $400 million for 2018.","For 2019, we expect a cash tax reduction from the tax act of about $70 million to $80 million with the positive impact of the full year of the lower tax rate, and the immediate expensing of capital investments being partially offset by the first payment of the deemed to repatriation of foreign earnings.","Turning now to our Q1 results on slide number 14. As Seifi mentioned, this was another record quarterly EPS, congratulations to the whole Air Products\u2019 team. Sales of $2.2 billion increased 18% versus last year as volume plus price were up 15% and currency added 3%. Volumes were up 13% with positive contributions from all three regions, driven by a new plants, a contract termination and associated plant sale in Asia and base business growth; the Asia plant sale was about 6% of the growth; new plants were about 5% and base business growth was about 2%; pricing was up 2%, driven by the China merchant business; currency was positive, driven by the Euro, British Pound and Chinese RMB.","EBITDA of $735 million improved by 12%, driven by the higher volumes and China pricing. EBITDA margin of 33.2% was down 160 basis points. The Asia contract termination and plant sale negatively impacted margins by about 90 basis points, and the significant amount of energy pass-through on the hydrogen plant in India due to the high natural gas prices negatively impacted margins by 40 basis points. Excluding these two items, EBITDA margins were down 30 basis points, primarily due to higher planned maintenance cost.","Let me provide some more background on the Asia contract termination and associated plant sale. One of our onsite steel customers in China had a change in ownership, and approached us to end our long term supply agreement with them and purchase the plant from us. The customer had no contractual right to do this, but we are satisfied with the outcome of the negotiation and are pleased to reduce our long term exposure to this customer. We recognize the sales and profit from the sale of equipment this quarter, but will not see the sales and profit from the sale of gas going forward.","Sequentially, EBITDA was down 4%, primarily due to planned maintenance outage cost and lower OIE. Net income increased 23% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 22% versus prior year. ROCE of 11.9% declined by 80 basis points versus last year and 20 basis points sequentially despite the profit increase. This is because the denominator or the ROCE calculation has increased. The denominator is based on the five quarter average and this now includes four quarters with the significantly higher denominator as a result of the gain from the PMD sale.","Please turn to slide 15. The only non-GAAP items we had this quarter were related to the new tax act, and totaled $1.09 per share as I discussed earlier. Our adjusted Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.79 increased $0.32 or 22% versus last year. As I mentioned, this includes the $0.06 benefit from the new tax act. Excluding this benefit, our EPS was still up 18%. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.19 per share. This includes $0.08 for the contract termination of plant sale in China. Price and raw materials taken together increased the EPS by $0.08, driven by the China merchant pricing.","Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.15 as we had some positive items last year that didn't repeat, as well as well as higher planned maintenance cost and inflation. As a reminder, included in the cost major factors, is the other income and expense line on the consolidated P&L. As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik. The cost to provide these services are primarily in SG&A. The payment we received for this service was about $6 million this quarter and is shown in the other income and expense line.","This is down from recent quarters as the Evonik TSA ended during Q1. We expect the Versum TSA to finish at the end of Q2. We remain committed to taking actions to reduce the cost associated with providing these services, but would expect to see a brief gap between the end of the TSA income and the cost savings. Currency and foreign exchange gains and losses were $0.06 favorable, primarily due to the Euro, British pound and RMB. Equity affiliate income added $0.03 due to underlying strength across a number of our JVs, particularly in Mexico. Note that this excludes the new tax act related charge I mentioned earlier.","Other non-operating income added $0.04, primarily due to interest income. The overall tax rate was an $0.08 benefit versus last year with $0.06 due to the new tax act. Interest expense, non-controlling interest and shares outstanding totaled $0.01 unfavorable.","Now please turn to slide 16. We had another strong cash flow quarter in Q1 with distributable cash flow up almost $100 million to over $500 million. You'll see we've an updated slide that more closely aligns with our current situation. Investible cash flow is the amount of cash we have discretion or choice to deploy. It is after we pay interest, taxes, maintenance CapEx and dividends.","Certainly, dividend payments create value, and given our 36 year track record of raising dividends, we don't expect this to change. We then think of funding our growth capital, including acquisitions from our cash and balance sheet capacity, as well as from our investible cash flows. Investible cash flows what we've been describing is more than $1 billion per year. You can see we generated almost $350 million of investible cash flow in Q1.","As Seifi mentioned, we did close on a few acquisitions during Q1 and have included these in our CapEx and earnings guidance. Our total growth CapEx for Q1, including the acquisitions is about $400 million. Again, we think investible cash flow is now the right metric as it represents the cash generated that we can choose how to deploy in order to create shareholder value.","Turning to slide 17, I would like to update you on our capital deployment capacity. As I just mentioned, we view this capacity as available to enable projects and acquisitions. We have just over $3 billion of cash and short term investments as of December 31st. After maintaining a modest operating cash balance, we have just under $3 billion of cash available to invest. Our debt balance as of December 31st is about $3.5 billion. As you know, we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A\/A2 rating. We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA.","Based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA of $2.9 billion, this would support a debt level in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion. So in total, between our available cash and additional debt capacity, we've about $6 billion we can deploy today while maintaining our A\/A2 rating.","As I discussed on the previous slide, we also expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investible cash that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx, and dividends. So over the next three years, we expect to have a total of at least $9 billion available to invest, not including extra capacity created by EBITDA contributions from investing in profitable projects.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning Painter","Thanks, Scott. Volumes for all three industrial gas regional segments were up this quarter from a combination of new plants coming onstream, overall stronger merchant sales and the China plants that Scott mentioned.","The volume strength was broad based, covering a wide range of end markets. Pricing was also positive across the regions with Asia and particularly China posting the biggest gain. I would like to thank our team for staying close to our customers, driving competitiveness and creating growth opportunities.","Now please turn to slide 18 for a review of our gases Americas results. For the quarter, sales were up 5% on higher volumes, hydrogen demand was strong, particularly in the Gulf Coast as were North American merchant volumes, even including the impact of the end of a large wholesale contract.","Its not so much that we replaced the wholesale volume molecule by molecule, plant by plant. By taking advantage of opportunities in one market, say higher activity in the oil patch, we offset impacts elsewhere. Going forward, we would expect to replace the liquid oxygen and nitrogen more quickly than the liquid argon, which will advance in year-on-year sales comparison. In Latin America, we also achieved higher merchant gases volumes versus prior-year. Overall, pricing impact was slightly positive but rounded to flat as higher North American pricing was partially offset by negative mix.","EBITDA was up 1% compared to prior year as contributions from higher volumes and better equity affiliate income more than offset higher planned maintenance outage costs and the wholesale contract termination impact. These factors and lower margin sale of equipment caused the margin to be down 160 basis points. Sequentially, EBITDA was down 12% and margin was 310 basis points lower, primarily driven by the planned maintenance, outage costs, seasonally weaker volume demand and the wholesale impact. As we move into Q2, we\u2019ve seen some modest negative customer demand and feedstock and utility impacts from the very cold weather in the U.S. Gulf Coast.","Now, please turn to slide 19, to review our Europe, Middle East and Africa business. Sales were up 29% with volumes up 17%, energy costs pass through up 3% and currency up 9%. Our new hydrogen plant in India completing its second full quarter of operation drove a significant portion of the sales growth, while our merchant business contributed 3% volume growth. As a reminder, this 100% owned India hydrogen facility is reported in the EMEA segment while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in the Asia equity affiliate income. Overall, pricing was slightly positive but rounded to flat as higher real pricing was partially offset by customer and product mix.","EBITDA was up 18% compared to prior year, again primarily due to the new plant in India with higher-merchant sales and positive currency also contributing. EBITDA margin of 32% was down 320 basis points, almost completely due to higher energy cost pass through versus last year and the new plant in India, which has comparatively higher natural gas costs. Excluding these factors, EBITDA margin was down only 20 basis points, primarily due to a large planned maintenance outage in the quarter. EBITDA was down 9% sequentially on the planned outage cost, lower OIE and higher seasonal power costs.","Please turn to slide 20, gases Asia, where our business continue to deliver strong growth, strong sales and profit growth. Sales were up 47%, including the sale that Scott mentioned earlier. Excluding this, underlying sales were still up 15%. Underlying volumes were up 8%, driven by new plant on streams and 3% contribution from the merchant business. Pricing for the region was up 7%. In addition to strong base merchant pricing, we had a particularly significant spot sale, which concluded in January and will not repeat.","We expect the supply and demand balance to ease in Q2 with the Chinese New Year. But coming out of that, we believe the underlying fundamentals remain positive and I know our team is working diligently to maintain pricing momentum. EBITDA was up 38%. Excluding the contract termination and plant sale, EBITDA increased 26% due to the strong volumes, higher pricing and favorable currency. We are incurring higher distribution and sourcing costs to support our growing retail business. We think this is the right course of action, and the new business is certainly contributing.","EBITDA margin, excluding the contract termination and plant sale, was up 240 basis points. As Seifi mentioned, we announced the number of exciting new projects in Asia for coal gasification to produce syngas, ASU purchases and two awards for new long-term supply agreements with Samsung in Korea. The team is doing a great job of winning new opportunities, while continuing to execute on the base business, productivity and safety.","Finally, please turn to slide 21 for a brief comment on our global gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sales equipment business, as well as central industrial gas business cost. Sales were down $15 million while profits were up slightly, driven by the Jazan project. We continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and as we have said, expect on-stream in phases in early fiscal 2019.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a comment on our corporate segment.","Simon Moore","Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 22. Our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our Helium container business and our corporate costs. Sales and profits were down, primarily driven by lower LNG project activity. For FY18, we still don\u2019t expect an earnings headwind for the corporate segment.","Now I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, again, Simon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about Air Products' future. As I discussed earlier, we are very proud of having delivered on our promises from two years ago. And we are excited about the strong opportunities that we have to build on our success. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continues to be strong. We continue to be optimistic about the future of Air Products. We obviously cannot predict and we do not have control over worldwide political or economic developments. But we do have control over the operational and growth performance of Air Products, and we feel confident we can continue to deliver on our goals.","As you know, our portfolio actions and the strong cash flow generation of our company provides us with an expected capacity of over $9 billion to invest over the next three years. I truly believe that Air Products will be successful in utilizing our balance sheet, the best in the industry, to invest in our four industrial gases business to create significant value for our shareholders. We see great opportunities in mergers and acquisitions, asset buybacks and large new projects, as well as a significant amount of more typical industrial gas projects. Rest assured, we are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident that the risk return profile will create significant value for our shareholders.","Now please turn to a slide number 23. Our great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented and motivated employees remain focused on being the safest and most profitable and diverse industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Continuing our positive momentum, we have increased our guidance for fiscal year 2018 to a range of 715 to 735. This is up $0.30 from the guidance we gave you last quarter. As Scott mentioned, $0.20 to $0.25 of this is coming from the new tax act, with the remaining increase from improved confidence in our business performance. Our new guidance represents 13% to 16% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2017 performance. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to grow EPS by at least 10% every year.","For quarter two of fiscal year 2018, our earning per share guidance is $1.65 to a $1.70, which is up 15% to 19% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This includes approximately $0.05 from the new tax act. Excluding the tax act impact, our quarter two guidance is still up 12% to 15% over last year. Including our quarter one acquisitions, we now expect our capital spending to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2018. As I mentioned before, and I'd like to stress this, our EPS and CapEx guidance do not include any contribution from the Lu'An project or any future M&A opportunity.","We are certainly working on other opportunities that could potentially add to our results in fiscal 2018, but have not included any other significant acquisition in our guidance for now.","Now please turn to slide number 24. We remain committed to our goal of being the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We will continue to focus on safety, controlling our cost and investing in the many strategic growth opportunities that we see.","Now please turn to slide number 25, where I want to point out once again that we believe our real competitive advantage is the motivated and committed people of Air Products.","Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment of our drivers to transport our products in all kinds of severe weather conditions to deliver product to our customers. Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment from our operators and maintenance workers who day in and day out work hard to keep our plans running even during severe hurricanes and other challenging conditions to ensure reliable supply to our customers. Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment of our sales people who work hard every day to develop and bring in new opportunities to Air Products by creating value for our customers.","Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment and motivation of the rest of our team all over the world who work hard to run our company to the highest level of performance. Yes, our competitive advantage comes from the commitment and motivation of our people. I consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team.","Now we are delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Seifi, just on the India syngas project. Are there any metrics you can share with us on that project?","Seifi Ghasemi","Did you say are there any\u2026","David Begleiter","Any financial metrics you can share with us on that project?","Seifi Ghasemi","The return on that project is well above the guidance that we've told you, which is so called 10% internal rate of return, it's well above that.","David Begleiter","And capital to be deployed in this project?","Seifi Ghasemi","We cannot disclose the exact amount of the capital, David, but it is not a $1 billion project.","David Begleiter","And just on pricing Seifi what type of price traction are you seeing in the U.S. and Europe, and when you think we can get a little more positive pricing in the core merchant gas business?","Seifi Ghasemi","David, as you know, we don't want to be commenting on pricing for the future. But the pricing of what has happened in the past, we can comment on that and that has been positive, and I'd like Corning to expand on that. But as far as future pricing, because of the nature of our industry, we don't want to comment on that. But Corning?","Corning Painter","Yes, so I think your questions are probably about Europe and the Americas. Obviously, in Asia it's quite a strong story for us. Both in Europe and in the Americas, we have positive net pricing. So same molecule, same customer year-on-year have been able to move those prices? Yes we have. We do have a challenge with mix, which is typically larger customers just simply growing more in the current environment, taking more product year-on-year and in some degrees, mix of which molecules are being bought. But I'd say there's, in terms of real activity and real pricing, meaning same customer, same molecule, there's progress.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","When you look at your backlog, how much of your backlog has been hydrogen and syngas and how much of your backlog has been the traditional industrial gases, oxygen and nitrogen, argon, those sorts of things.","Seifi Ghasemi","Approximately 40% is syngas and about 60% is the traditional business.","Jeff Zekauskas","And in commentary, you said that repatriation impacts would be about negative 453 and then there's the revaluation of deferred taxes. And you netted that out to $239 million. Should we look at that $239 as the amount of additional cash taxes that you'll pay over the next eight years, excluding the annual changes to your normal corporate rate?","Seifi Ghasemi","I would like to -- that is the net amount of cash that will go out of the company in the next eight years. That is correct. But against that, obviously, we have the benefit of lower cash cost in the United States because of the lower tax rate. So when you balance that, you can calculate the real net present value.","Corning Painter","And maybe if I could just build on that, Jeff, I feel obviously with the deferred taxes, there is some timing that might even go further out. But it\u2019s a reasonable way to think about it. Its just in the timeframe of the eight years maybe we have to take that a little longer.","Operator","We will take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Just wanted to flush out a little bit more of the plant sale. So just going off your 20% in the volume number in the Delta that Corning gave of 12% EBITDA. If you calculate it, is about $130 million sale price in about $22 million of profit that you recognized in EBITDA. Is that the right way to strip out to get an underlying?","Seifi Ghasemi","As usual, Duffy, you are very good at doing your math.","Duffy Fischer","And then if I assume that you sold it for about 12 times, would that mean that the underlying profit that\u2019s going to go away that we\u2019ve seen from plant historically is about $10 million a year or $2.5 million a quarter?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well no, that\u2019s not the correct way of looking at that. But I think we can go through that detail offline with -- Simon can give you a lot more detail on that.","Duffy Fischer","And then just the last one, Seify. With the syngas stuff, how big in the portfolio would you be comfortable letting the syngas project to get over the next two or three years?","Seifi Ghasemi","We are shooting for about 40%.","Duffy Fischer","Well that\u2019s 40% of the backlog. So I am just wondering like you had talked before about having $8 billion or so to invest over a number of years. Half of that, all of it, how much of it could being in syngas at the end of the day?","Seifi Ghasemi","Right now, we are targeting more than 50%.","Operator","We will go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs for a question.","Bob Koort","Maybe one for Scott, if I could. On slide 15, I might have missed this, Scott, but you show a price component and a cost component to the EPS. Can you talk why the costs were up 2x the price?","Scott Crocco","On cost we had -- lots of things that happened last year. Good news items that didn\u2019t repeat, as well as in this quarter we had some higher planned maintenance. And of course, as always, we have inflations. So those would be the key items that are driving the cost year-on-year. I will also point out that in the price raw materials is there any changing in power and input cost are netted in there. So that is price net of those input costs and still recovered $0.08 above, which is separate from the cost item down below.","Bob Koort","And then Seifi, if I could follow up. Within China, obviously, there is a lot of environmentalism that seems beginning some traction, and maybe a move away from coal as a fuel source. Can you talk about how that\u2019s impacting it all, the growth potential for coal to go into liquids and chemicals?","Seifi Ghasemi","That is obviously a very positive development for us, because the push obviously from an environmental point of view is to use less coal for producing power. But we are talking about here in the projects that we are pursuing is turning the coal, especially high sulfur coal into environmentally friendly way by gasifying it and producing chemicals. So all of the push for the environmental thing is actually very positive thing for us and that is why if you study the details of China's 13 and five year plan, there is a significant number of projects designated for coal gasification. And we are obviously very much involved in that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Capital.","DonCarson","Question on the merchant business, I can see the merchant operating leverage in China and the margin impact it had there. What's going on in say North America and Europe, can you talk about merchant operating rates? How much they are going up and what incremental operating leverage we can expect?","Seifi Ghasemi","I'll have Corning to address that.","Corning Painter","So in North America, we of course has the challenge of absorbing a loss of a large wholesale agreement that we had. We still published overall positive volumes for merchant. I just want to say that's a good accomplishment by the team. But it\u2019s both same factors when we report out our numbers that Scott mentioned that are challenge in that, so the higher maintenance cost and some positives from last year not repeating. The new business that we\u2019re signing, however, is certainly the contributing to the overall results.","Seifi Ghasemi","But Jeff to be very specific, the operating rates right now in U.S. and Europe, are around 75%. Usually in industrial gases business when your operating rates gets to around 80% then you have significant pricing leverage and that is what is happening in China. But that is not the case yet in U.S. and Europe.","Donald Carson","Then Seifi a follow-up on capital deployment. If you look at all of the projects you signed in the roaster you've given, how much of that $9 billion total have you deployed thus far?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well quite frankly, if you add up the projects that we have announced and some of them are in the process like the big Yankuang project and so on, out of that $9 billion, about almost $4 billion of it is committed.","Operator","For our next question, we will go to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher Parkinson","Scott mentioned this a little, but in IG Americas, there was some planned maintenance around which hit margins, but volumes appear pretty solid in the merchant business, as well as hydrogen. Can you just give a little more color on these fronts just for the balance of the year and just anything of note will be greatly appreciated? Thanks.","Seifi Ghasemi","I think I'll turn it over to Corning to expand on that. But what I want say is that these so called planned maintenance cost are -- basically the big money is in our hydrogen facilities and those things, the timing of those, is not under our control, it's under control of our customers. And a lot of our customers are having turnaround this year, and each one of these turnarounds is $20 million to $30 million of expense. So that it's timing, but it is a necessary thing that we need to do. Corning?","Corning Painter","Yes, so I think you\u2019re just interested in the market conditions. So I\u2019first say I think underlying hydrogen demand remains really quite strong. And we've seen a little bit in this period as we had the cold weathers in the Gulf coast, but I would say we bounce back from that very quickly. And at this point, our customers are pretty nearly fully backed as well. Oil field services is probably a change for the higher oil field prices. We see more nitrogen going into that market. But by enlarge, I'd say there\u2019s just broad based strength in North America right now.","Christopher Parkinson","And just a quick derivative question from trends in the Chinese merchant market in terms of lines and price. Can you just comment on any remaining supply side dynamics that would help maintain the momentum in fiscal year '18? Are there still additional facility closures, steel for instance? Or do you believe the comps will become more difficult as you progress throughout the year? And then just also any quick comments on regional demand trends if you have any by end market would be helpful? Thanks.","Corning Painter","So I think, first of all, I\u2019d maybe take those in reverse order, cause I think the key point there is, there's just broad based industrial momentum in probably the world today. But China being to certain degree a workshop for the world, there's broad space demand growth there. Obviously, the coastal area is a little bit stronger than inland. We're going to see the Chinese New Year impact. It'll be interesting to see how quickly the volumes rebound from that.","Coming out of that, I would expect the overall supply demand dynamics to remain very positive for the industry. We had last year the shutting down of the induction furnaces. I think what we're going to see is some new demand perhaps from furnaces that'll probably strengthen as we come into the coming year. All in all, I think it's going to remain a positive dynamic for us.","Seifi Ghasemi","I'd just like to stress on that Chris that we are very positive about the developments in China.","Operator","For our next question we'll go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Pete on for Jim. Do you see any significant acquisition opportunities outside of China? And along those lines, can you quantify how much of the Praxair Linde divestitures you might be interested in bidding for?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, in terms of M&A opportunities, we do see opportunities outside of China. I don't want to say more than that, but we are working on some of that. In terms of the Praxair and Linde thing, we have to wait and see what actually comes out. But we have always said that out of what we think they have to divest, we don't have any inside knowledge on this thing. But out of what we think they have to invest, there will be an opportunity for us to compete in about $1 billion to $1.5 billion of sale, which would have about probably about $300 million to $350 million of EBITDA. And obviously, when and if that thing comes into play, we will be interested in that for sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","Is your interest in coal derived syngas driven more by growth prospects for that process, or would you say you bring to it a technological advantage, given coal derived gasifications been around a long time over there. Do you have a technological advantage, either from your ASU technology or with the Shell technology you acquired. Is it demand or technology driven?","Seifi Ghasemi","It is actually both, the demand is obviously there. And then in order to put ourselves in a competitively advantageous position, we not only bring our knowhow in terms of ASUs and operations and maintenance of large facilities, but our competitors have that. But that is the primary reason that we wanted to buy the Shell technology, because now we will have a technological advantage.","Steve Byrne","Does any royalty bearing revenue come with that technology?","Seifi Ghasemi","Not much.","Steve Byrne","And on the demand side, would you say that most of these new projects that are coal derived syngas are incremental production capacity projects or retrofits of old gasifiers that are inefficient and air polluting and need to be shuttered?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, none of the old gasifiers are polluting, gasification is a very clean way of using coal. Most of these opportunities that you're talking about are Greenfield plants.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Scott, maybe I could just ask you to give us some help on Americas margin sequentially, just given you had the maintenance in this quarter, the wholesale thing and then are there any positive things that's replaced last year that wont\u2019s recur in the second quarter. But just how should we think about margins sequentially?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, we obviously think that the margins are going to be competitive. But I'd like to hand it over to Corning to expand on that. Let's just make it very clear. We do remain very bullish about opportunities for industrial gases, our conventional business around the world. We think China is growing, U.S. is growing, Europe is growing and our margins, but we are losing any margin, it is just quarter-by-quarter. So fundamentally, we are very confident about what's going on and we are actually feel pretty strong about that. But, Corning?","Corning Painter","So just building on everything Seifi just said. So we feel that the underlying demand merchant gases, hydrogen and the whole package remains very strong. We're going to have other maintenance during the course of the year. And so sequential-to-sequential, we don't really map out exactly as our maintenance spending is coming out. But I would say the overall picture one that's strengthening in the Americas.","Vincent Andrews","And then maybe just as a follow-up for Seifi. I guess that there\u2019s now $5 billion less that hasn't been allocated out to $9 billion from answer to previous question. Given the change in the tax environment in the United States, are you focused at all anymore or focused at all incrementally on putting some of that money to work in the U.S.? Does that change your investment calculus at all?","Seifi Ghasemi","Listen, on that one, if there's any project that we can go after, our number one priority is to spend our money in the United States, because of a lot of good reasons. So the fact that we are investing in other parts of the world, doesn't mean that we are not focused in the U.S., we are very focused in the U.S. And if there's any project that we can go after, we will go after in the U.S., that's our number one priority for investing. There's no question about that. The issue is that there're not that many opportunities, right now; but we are absolutely focused on that; we need to push everyday on every single project; and I hope in time, we will announce some big ones in the U.S. too.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","With regards to the cold weather along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Do you expect that to be good, bad, or neutral to your results in the fiscal second quarter? Just trying to think about the net effect of how are costs versus any customer outages that you see?","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you Kevin for the question. Corning, can answer that.","Corning Painter","Kevin, I think when we have a disruption in the market, it's never a positive for us. But I would just say the guidance that we have given reflects our expectations for the quarter, including what's happened in terms of weather.","Kevin McCarthy","And then as a follow up, if I may, for Seifi. Can you expand upon the China contract termination. What motivated your steel customer to want to purchase the plant from you? And I think you mentioned that you were pleased with the development. Perhaps you can expand on that as well.","Seifi Ghasemi","Corning can expand on that, go ahead.","Corning Painter","So we had a contract with a customer. that customer then got acquired by another steel company, who was less bought in, let's say, into the sale of gas concept. We have a good contract. They wanted to just -- and are basically good faith negotiations, understanding their thought process, how they look to things. We thought the termination that we came up with was a good win-win for us. I just point out in the same quarter, we have examples of where we've taken a plant that was going to be an SOE and we\u2019ve converted it into a cell of gas. So I think there're some do and some don't in China that we continue to progress the transformation of that market to be more of a traditional industrial gas environment.","Seifi Ghasemi","And Kevin, it was very simply the fact that the new owners of the steel -- the way they do their financials and all of that, they decided that their cost of capital is on all of that that they rather own the plant rather than us supplying it. It\u2019s just preference of the customer. And we always are obviously do what the customer wants to do. And the transaction financially was also very effective for us. And so they have put that money to work at a higher return.","Corning Painter","And I would say being our flexibility in changing had a lot to do with the fact that it was a new customer stepping in.","Operator","We will go now to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","Quickly, can you explain the advantage of your strong balance sheet. When you\u2019re bidding for this large ASUs and large syngas plant in China? And then what kind of competitors or competition do you run into for these large projects?","Seifi Ghasemi","We are running through the standard competitors, you know who they are and we compete with them on the basis of -- its not just the price, I would like to make -- its not just the financial returns, it\u2019s the combination of the trust that -- relationship that we have with the customer, the demonstration that we have delivered, our technology. Now we are going to have an advantage with the acquisition of the Shell technology. So it\u2019s a combination of all of things like we compete and we compete with the people basically that we have been competing with for many years.","P.J. Juvekar","And you talked about the environmental advantage of coal gasification. What are the risk to coal gasification? Let's say, if China implements carbon tax in the future. Will that impact the economics of the project?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, the thing is that if they implement -- about this coal gasification do P. J., the coal gasification is producing chemical. So whatever tax they put in, it just increases the price of the chemical, because they can't say okay I'm not going to do coal gasification. So if you are not going to do coal gasification, what are you going to do? Then you have to buy out of these chemicals and import them into the country.","The fundamental thing is that coal is the only energy source that China has. As a result, their only option, if they want to be independent, is to turn that coal into chemicals and syngas. Otherwise, they would have to import that, which is what they do right now. That is why this is a high priority for the government. And coal gasification has the advantage of being able to use 2%, 3% high sulphur coal that you cant do anything else with it. So it's financially very attractive.","Corning Painter","Can I just build on it. So, the gasification has a set in which you remove that sulphur after we gasified it. So I mean literally coal which you can't really legally use in other applications, you can use it here because we're going to get the sulphur out. And another element is that there was an incentive around carbon capture. Coal gasification has the benefit of giving you a very concentrated stream of CO2 that would be easier to work within almost any other process.","Seifi Ghasemi","The center point about what Corning just said is that if you are building any kind of a facility to produce syngas, gasification is the process where the CO2 that you produce is what is called capture ready. You can actually capture that and then put into for enhanced oil recovery in a lot of other applications.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Scott, tax reform didn\u2019t start until January 1. So this fiscal September '17 I guess has three quarters of benefit. And I assume the December quarter recruit essentially a quarter of those three quarters of benefit. I am just trying to understand why the tax rate is even lower in the December quarter? And will this fiscal \u201819 tax rate go down a little bit more, because you'll have four quarters of benefit in '19?","Scott Crocco","So first in terms of our base underlying rate. You\u2019re absolutely right. We have one quarter 35, three quarters of [20 million]. We\u2019re required to take an estimate and blend that together. So it's that underlying with the 24.5. But as you pointed too, we had a even after adjusted for the new tax act. We had a little bit lower ATR here in the first quarter, principally driven by the accounting for share based compensation. So when we look at that and we talked about in total versus last year, maybe we\u2019re down about 370 basis points. Now 260 of which is coming from the tax act and the balance of that 110 is from the share based comp.","And so I think as I said in my prepare remarks then to going forward, for the full year, maybe it's a 20 to 21 rate to be used. And then when we look at it at the timing and the implementation of the various elements of the tax act, you\u2019ve got to -- at this point in time, these are all best estimates. But I think that's a reasonable type of the rate we carry into 19 as well.","John Roberts","And then Corning, could you remind us why you split India between EMEA and Asia. Is it how you have your hydrogen group reporting up globally versus maybe regional on the industrial gas on the atmospheric gas side?","Corning Painter","Yes, I would say that's a reflection of -- at point in time when we did that. Clearly, at this point, we\u2019re tremendously beefing up our syngas capabilities in Asia, however.","Seifi Ghasemi","But in terms of reporting that you are talking about, in terms of how we report that, quite honestly traditionally, we have been reporting that that way and we didn\u2019t want to change that, if not to confuse the numbers. But on operationally, we run Middle-East and India separate from Europe. But in terms of the reporting the results, we put all of that together because we didn\u2019t want to create a lot of confusion about comparison to previous years.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Harrison","In terms of the underlying improvement and the Asia margin performance this quarter, as I exclude the impact of the plant sales. Is that really just the impact of the pricing improvement there? Can you maybe talk about other dynamics that are at work there, helping your margin and how sustainable that is, going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","Corning has two pages of details on that. And so he'll answer your question.","Corning Painter","I think, the big positive for us in Asia is pricing right now and you'd add on to that volume leverage and incremental loading, it\u2019s those things that are pulling us forward. I would say maybe if you're just building on it like a highly motivated team that's again organized by sub-regions all of them with our own incentive plan on their own actual results. So they are just driven to let\u2019s get the volume and let's get the price, and let's take advantage of this opportunity to absolutely the fullest.","Mike Harrison","And you haven't commented on where your capacity utilization rates are for LOX\/LINin China. But I know one of your competitors mentioned that they're running over 90%, which is the point at which we might get concerned or expect to see from capacity additions. Are there any expectations on your part to debottleneck or otherwise add merger capacity in China over the next year or so?","Corning Painter","I don't think we want to really give a clear roadmap exactly where all our strategic options are in China, at this point. Clearly, it\u2019s an area of opportunity though and we're quite focused on that.","Mike Harrison","And if I can sneak one more in, Seifi. Any updated thoughts on share repurchase opportunities.","Seifi Ghasemi","Not interested.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Lawrence Alexander with Jefferies.","Lawrence Alexander","Just very quickly discuss on the EBITDA margin. Can you give a little bit more detail on how much of a tailwind you had globally from merchant pricing in the quarter. And then going forward, if we're thinking out to 2019, 2020. Are the acquisitions of plants and the syngas projects, both margin accretive or does one offset the other to some extent. And do you have any onsite business, any pools of assets that are below the take or pay threshold, such that volume growth does not translate into profit growth if this strength in the end market continues for the next couple of years.","Scott Croco","This is Scott. Let me take the first one. The impact from pricing is maybe 50 basis points or so, something like that at the company\u2026","Seifi Ghasemi","But overall, Lawrence -- overall when you look at the projects that we have taken and the onsite projects that we have taken and as they come onstream, their margins, they are not going to have a negative effect on our margins. Therefore, we expect to maintain an EBITDA margin, as we have said before, of somewhere between around 32% to 35%. And none of the projects that we have taken is going to cause that margin to go down. Actually, some of them might actually improve the margin.","Lawrence Alexander","I guess, if you can just clarify that a little bit. If your merchant pricing already before things get tight is a 50 basis point tailwind then over three or four years, it's probably going to be a little bit more of a tailwind from here. And if your rest is basically flattish, shouldn't you be to overshoot the 35% or what's the offset that you see?","Seifi Ghasemi","You're getting us into trying to give guidance now for '19 and '20. But I think you are on the right track to assuming that the overall conditions are positive for Air Products and our margins and we agree with that, but I don't want to...","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Seifi Ghasemi for any final remarks.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you very much. With that, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call. Thanks for taking time from your busier schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the best. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Scott Crocco, our CFO. John will make a few opening remarks and summarize our results. Scott will provide more detail on our quarterly and fiscal year results and update our outlook for 2014, and I will provide perspective on each of our key operating segments. After our remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]","We issued our earnings release this morning. It's available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, are also available on our website.","Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides, and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to John.","John E. McGlade","Thank you, Simon, and let me also wish everyone a good morning. We greatly appreciate you joining us on the call today. I want to start off by providing you with my perspective on our fiscal year. In 2013, Air Products delivered on our key priorities: cost reduction, productivity improvements, disciplined project execution and portfolio management. While the economy was weaker than expected, our volumes improved, and our productivity initiatives more than offset inflation. All of this produced clear benefits for our shareholders.","As you can see on Slide 3, we had a solid year. We grew sales by 6%, and our underlying volumes x PUI grew by 1%. We grew both operating income and EPS by 2% each, short of expectations at the beginning of the year but consistent with our recent guidance. We increased the dividend by 11%, making this the 31st consecutive year of dividend increases by Air Products. And we also bought back 5.7 million shares during the year at an average price of just under $81 or a 24% discount to our year-end closing price. Overall, we have returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks since 2008, and we delivered a total shareholder return of 33% for the year, well in excess of the S&P 500 DSR of 19%.","In addition, we continue to make significant progress with our portfolio and productivity actions. We delivered cost savings of $60 million from our 2012 European focus reorganization, both on time and on budget. And we are taking additional actions aimed at reducing cost by a further $75 million, up from our target of $60 million in new savings that we discussed on our Q3 earnings call. These actions, which include product exits and asset rationalizations, as well as organizational improvements, are focused on strengthening our electronics business, particularly focused on products that serve the LED and photovoltaic, or PV, markets. In addition, we are restructuring our global operation functions and further optimizing our European cost structure.","We delivered solid cost performance and productivity, and our SG&A to sales of 10.5% remains the best in the industry. And we are on track to exit the remainder of our Polyurethane Intermediates, or PUI, business in the next several months as we satisfy our final contract obligations. We delivered on our commitments to our customers and shareholders by executing on our backlog of projects safely, on time, on budget and at returns that are well above our cost of capital. We brought on stream more than a dozen major new projects, including hydrogen plants and air separation plants in the United States, Europe and China. These investments are backed by long-term, take-or-pay contracts, and will drive cash flow and earnings growth in the future. And we successfully integrated the Indura acquisition in South America, strengthening our position in this fast-growing market.","Now please turn to Slide 4. On the new business side, we had a very successful year winning new and profitable projects. We continue to see exciting growth in the oxygen for coal gasification market in China, the hydrogen market globally and the LNG market around the world. And finally, our energy-from-waste business in the Tees Valley 1 project are going very well. I visited the site earlier this year and I was very impressed. We are on schedule, on budget and meeting our safety goals. We remain confident in the business strategy I shared with you when we announced the first Tees Valley project, including the proven on-site business model supported by long-term contracts with firm prices, we do not take the price of volume risk for any of the inputs or outputs of the plant, a clear and compelling market need in the U.K. to reduce waste and create clean and renewable energy, and we have proven expertise in every unit of operation: oxygen production, gasification, syngas clean-up and power generation. With that, we have decided to proceed with the second facility adjacent to the Tees Valley 1 project. The schedule will be optimized to take advantage of project synergies and the Renewable Obligation Credit, or ROC, program. Simon will provide more details, but as a result, we expect Tees Valley 2 to be more profitable than Tees Valley 1.","Before I conclude, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to delivering on our priorities for 2014. These priorities have not changed. We are focused on executing against our backlog, winning profitable new projects, loading existing assets and implementing further productivity and cost initiatives. The investments we have made over the past several years and our ability to adapt to changing economic conditions are key drivers for Air Products' future. We believe shareholders will realize increasingly stronger returns as earnings growth from the profitable projects in our backlog contribute in 2014 and accelerate significantly in 2015 and 2016.","Now let me turn the call over to Scott.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 5 for a review of our 2013 results. Sales of $10.2 billion increased 6%, with acquisitions contributing 5% and higher energy pass-through contributing 2%. Our underlying sales were 1% higher on strength in our North American and Asian Tonnage businesses, higher Performance Materials volumes and LNG equipment orders. These were partially offset by weakness in our electronics equipment area. The impact of our wind-down of our PUI business was unfavorable by 2%.","Overall volume growth was more modest than we had expected. While this is primarily due to weak macro economic environment, particularly in Europe and Asia, we remain focused on loading our existing assets.","Our operating income and earnings per share were both up 2%, while our operating margin for the year was 15.4%, down 60 basis points, primarily due to higher pension costs.","Our return on capital employed, or ROCE, declined by 140 basis points to 10.1% as a result of higher capital spending, including the Indura acquisition. This is well above our 8% cost of capital. As a reminder, we are developing, executing and operating good projects that are accretive to ROCE over the next few years.","Turning to Slide 6, let me now take you through our fiscal Q4 results. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 1% lower than prior year on lower volumes and stable pricing, partially offset by higher energy pass-through and currency. Sequentially, overall sales increased 2% on a 3% stronger volumes across all business segments.","Operating income of $421 million increased 3% versus prior year and 10% sequentially. Our operating margin of 16.3% was up 60 basis points versus prior year, despite higher pension costs. Sequentially, our margin improved 130 basis points, primarily due to higher volumes and lower costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share were up 3% and 4%, respectively, versus last year.","Turning to Slide 7, you can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. The non-GAAP items include the cost reduction program John mentioned, a charge of $232 million before tax, $158 million after-tax, or about $0.74 per share. We expect to see annual benefits of about $75 million beginning in fiscal 2015. The fiscal '14, benefits we expect to see are about $45 million or $0.15 per share. This charge includes $141 million for actions within our electronics process materials business. The charge includes the final contract settlement and exit from the silane business, a restructuring of our NF3 and ammonia positions in the U.S. and a number of headcount reductions.","The lack of growth in the PV market overall and the collapse of the thin-film PV sector specifically led to overcapacity in both NF3 and silane. As you can see, we have taken decisive actions to exit the silane business, where we were not a basic manufacturer, and to optimize our NF3 capacity by reducing production in the U.S. The LED market also suffers from overcapacity and we have reduced our U.S. ammonia production accordingly.","To be clear, the rest of the electronics portfolio continues to deliver value, and we are comfortable with its place on our portfolio. The on-site business is stable and grows as we renew nitrogen plant orders for new fabs. And the advanced materials business is driven by new product development as it is focused on providing solutions for customers' advanced node manufacturing. We believe the strength of our on-site, advanced materials and delivery systems businesses, combined with the positive impact of these decisive actions, positions our electronics business for continual profitable growth in the future.","The charge also includes $61 million of other costs, including further restructuring of our European Merchant organization, rightsizing our Asian Merchant organization for the expected slower growth environment, restructuring our global operations team and the elimination of additional administrative costs.","Finally, there's an additional $30 million of other asset actions within the Merchant and Tonnage businesses for the shutdown of underutilized facilities. Also included in this quarter's non-GAAP items is $0.03 of costs for advisory services.","In discontinued operations, we had a $0.06 impact from lower expected proceeds for the divestiture of the U.K.\/Ireland Homecare business that we are continually actively marketing. As a reminder, we recorded a $0.70 per share gain in the third quarter fiscal '12 when we completed the sale of the larger continental Homecare business. Excluding these items, our continuing operations EPS of $1.47 increased by $0.05 or 4% versus last year.","Volumes increased EPS by $0.08, with each business segment up year-on-year. The positive impact on profits was driven by mix, primarily the impact of less lower margin sale of Equipment business. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.04, due primarily to the higher raw material costs in Merchant and Electronics and Performance businesses and lower pricing in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment.","Net cost performance was flat, including a $0.05 unfavorable pension impact. Our productivity efforts more than offset inflation.","Excluded from the volume and cost lines is a net $0.01 unfavorable impact from our decision to exit the PUI business. This is a smaller impact than last quarter due to our asset management efforts.","Currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.01 favorable. Equity affiliate income contributed $0.01. Noncontrolling interest was $0.03 unfavorable, primarily due to stronger Indura results. Lower interest expense, tax rate and shares outstanding each contributed $0.01. And overall, we delivered a good quarter on solid execution and cost performance.","Now for a review of the business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 8, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of over $1 billion were up 4% versus last year, driven by 3% stronger volumes and 1% improved pricing. Liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes were up again in all regions, partially offset by lower helium volumes globally due to the supply challenges and packaged gases demand weakness in Europe.","Sales were up 2% sequentially on stronger volumes and flat pricing. Volumes were stronger in U.S., Canada and Asia, while Europe saw the normal seasonal summer slowdown.","Helium volume was below our expectations and was again down versus prior year, driven by reduced availability from our helium feedstock suppliers in the U.S. and Algeria. It was certainly positive that an agreement was reached to avoid shutdown of the U.S. government helium supply. However, we expect helium to remain relatively tight over the next few years until some of the longer-term sources we are developing come on stream. We do expect modest sequential improvement through next year as we begin to get product from our Wyoming facility late in Q1 and additional Middle Eastern supply helps the industry.","As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to actively develop new sources. We announced yesterday a new project to extract helium from a Kinder Morgan facility already in operation in Doe Canyon, Colorado. This new facility is expected to produce 230 million standard cubic feet per year of pure helium, replacing more than 15% of the BLM supply as that system declines. We expect the new facility on stream in early 2015.","Globally, for the full year, contract signings continued to be strong, up double digits from last year's record level. In addition, customer retention improved significantly.","Merchant Gases operating income of $177 million was up 10% versus prior year and up 7% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.7% was up 90 basis points compared to last year and up 70 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on the higher volumes, improved pricing, particularly in U.S.\/Canada and lower costs, particularly in Europe, from last year's cost reduction program. Sequentially, operating income was up on higher volumes and lower costs.","Let's now review the Merchant business by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In U.S.\/Canada, sales were up 12% on 7% higher volumes and 5% higher pricing. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes were again up 5% on strength in the oilfield services, food, metals and petrochemical markets as we continue to see positive contributions from last year's strong contract signings. Liquid argon volumes were also up on strong demand, and we saw a positive volume contribution from the EPCO acquisition, but helium volumes were down due to supply limitations. LOX\/LIN capacity utilization is up slightly to the mid-70s. Overall pricing was positive, primarily driven by helium. LOX\/LIN prices were slightly positive, reflecting our price increase and recovery of higher power costs.","We announced a new West Texas liquid nitrogen facility to support the Oilfield Services business in the Permian Basin. We expect this facility to deliver solid profitability when on stream in 2015 as a result of the expected strong Oilfield Services demand growth. In 2012, we started up a similar facility in Oklahoma for this market, and it has more than exceeded our expectations. These targeted capacity additions are great investments.","In Europe, sales were up 1% versus last year on 2% lower volumes, flat pricing and a 3% increase from currency. LOX\/LIN volumes were flat versus prior year, with some strength in Central and Southern Europe. Argon and CO2 volumes were up, while helium volumes were down on supply constraints. Cylinder volumes were down on lower demand across the region. Overall pricing was flat with positive helium pricing offsetting negative LOX\/LIN pricing, and LOX\/LIN plant loadings were in the mid-70s.","In Asia, sales were up 5% versus last year on 7% higher volumes, 3% lower prices and a positive 1% currency impact. LOX\/LIN volumes were up double digits across the region and in China. Liquid argon volumes and our Microbulk product lines showed significant improvements, while helium was down on supply limitations and cylinder volumes were down slightly on customer profitability actions. Plant loadings remained in the mid-70s with moderate capacity additions. Pricing was down in the liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon business, particularly in China, driven in part by the wholesale market.","Latin America is an increasingly important part of our global portfolio and a significant emerging market opportunity. With the acquisition of Indura 1 year ago, we believe it is important to begin to provide a Latin America regional commentary. As a reminder, Air Products has a wholly owned business in Brazil; a majority-owned business, Indura; and an equity affiliate joint venture in Mexico. So our sales and operating income commentary won't include Mexico as their results are included in equity affiliate income.","Underlying sales were up 1% on flat volumes and 1% higher prices. There was a negative 5% impact from currency. Brazil volumes were flat overall, with some LOX\/LIN growth offset by cylinder weakness. We brought onstream a new liquid plant in S\u00e3o Paulo that is providing significant productivity benefits.","Indura volumes were flat with delays and mining projects in Chile and economic weakness in Colombia and Argentina. The LOX\/LIN plant capacity utilization is in the mid-70s. After our first year of the Indura acquisition, we remain pleased with the team and the business. The integration has gone well. We've exceeded our expectations for synergies and are seeing more new Merchant liquid and small on-site opportunities than we had anticipated, a real credit to the combined Air Products and Indura teams.","Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $835 million were down 1% versus last year on higher energy pass-through, offset by lower PUI volumes. Volumes x PUI were down 1%, as strong U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen volumes continued but were offset by a contract termination in Latin America. We are particularly pleased to see continued strong U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen volumes leveraging our pipeline system.","The exit of our PUI business by January 2014 is proceeding as we expected. For the quarter, PUI sales were down about $55 million versus prior year, and operating income was down modestly as we continued to reduce the remaining cost structure of that business. For the full year, as expected, PUI sales were down about $160 million, and operating income was down about $25 million.","For the segment, sequential sales were down 1% on higher volumes, offset by lower energy pass-through. Operating income of $135 million was down 4% versus prior year and down 2% x PUI as we saw higher maintenance costs due to more customer-planned outages, higher pension costs and the impact of the contract termination.","For the Tonnage business, our maintenance cost timing is primarily driven by the timing of our customers' planned outages. Obviously, it's beneficial to take our hydrogen plants offline for maintenance at the same time our customer has reduced demands due to their maintenance activities. With more planned customer outages in FY '14, we do expect an increase in costs before we return to more typical and lower levels in FY '15.","Operating income was up 12% sequentially. X PUI, operating income was up 9%, primarily on the higher volumes. Operating margin of 16.1% was down 60 basis points versus prior year on a lower operating income and higher energy cost pass-through. Margin was up 190 basis points sequentially on the higher operating income and lower energy cost pass-through.","As we said last quarter, we continue to see strong project development activity in the global hydrogen business, and we're pleased to recently announce 2 significant projects. First, we will build, own and operate an industrial gas complex to supply Bharat Petroleum's Kochi, India refinery and petrochemical complex. Air Products will be supplying 165 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen and steam from 2 steam methane reformers, syngas from our purification system, nitrogen and oxygen from an air separation unit, and we'll produce our own power from a gas turbine. As more regions focus on cleaner fuels and more customers see the value in outsourcing their industrial gases through the on-site model, we believe our leadership position in global hydrogen will continue to drive growth.","We also announced that we will build, own and operate a new 150 million standard cubic feet a day hydrogen production unit to supply Shell Canada's Scotford facility near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This plant will also supply North West's Sturgeon refinery with approximately 25 million standard cubic feet a day and will be connected to our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline system, supplying customers throughout the region. We expect to continue to see growth opportunities as refiners and upgraders expand operations in Western Canada.","Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $580 million were down 6% versus last year, with volumes down 5% and pricing down 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 3% due to higher volumes. Versus prior year, Electronics sales were down 15%, primarily driven by lower Equipment sales, both delivery systems and sales of equipment in the on-site business last year. Tonnage was up, and process materials was down, primarily due to our decision to exit the silane business.","Electronics sales were up 4% sequentially on improvement in delivery systems in both process and advanced materials. Performance Materials sales were up 7% versus last year as we saw positive growth across all regions and all major product lines. Orders were strong, construction markets improved, while marine coatings continued to be weak. Europe was stronger on export-driven markets. Sequentially, PMD sales were flat, which is better than the typical seasonal reduction.","Operating income of $96 million was up 12% versus prior year, primarily due to an inventory revaluation last year. Operating margin was up 270 basis points to 16.5% on the higher operating income. Sequentially, operating income was up 10%, and operating margin was up 120 basis points, primarily due to the higher electronics materials volumes","Now please turn to Slide 12, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $118 million were down 7% versus prior year as lower ASU activity was only partially offset by higher LNG activity and up 14% sequentially on higher LNG activity. Operating income of $21 million was up 16% over prior year and up 28% sequentially, primarily on the higher LNG activity. As we said before, margins are higher on LNG projects than on ASU projects, so product mix impacts the results. The backlog of $402 million is down 11% from last year and up 23% versus last quarter, as we continued to see the sequential benefits of new LNG orders.","During the quarter, we were pleased to announce a mid-scale LNG order for Technip in ShaanXi, China, reinforcing our commitment to supply all spectrums of the LNG market. In addition to this exciting order, the engineering and manufacturing activity, in support of our LNG business, remains at a high level and the outlook for the next several years is very promising. We expect to have a number of additional project award announcements soon.","Air Products liquefaction technology has been selected for several of the LNG export projects being planned for North America. As these projects progress to the necessary licensing and permitting processes, we expect that one or more will reach final investment decisions in FY '14 and '15, resulting in firm equipment orders for Air Products. These projects are in addition to the Dominion Cove Point order, which was announced in April of 2013. Meanwhile, work is continuing on the 2 major floating LNG projects that we have in-house for Shell and PETRONAS, and we see continued opportunities in this market. In support of this increased activity, our second coil-wound heat exchanger manufacturing facility under construction in Florida will be coming online early in 2014, just in time to meet expected market demand.","As John mentioned, we are excited about the progress in our Tees Valley 1 energy-from-waste project and the decision to proceed with the Tees Valley 2 project at the same site. Tees Valley 1 is on budget, meeting our safety goals, and on schedule to begin commissioning in late FY '14, and we expect the plant to be fully onstream in early FY '15. The Tees Valley 2 schedule is optimized to take advantage of project execution and startup synergies, with startup expected in early 2016. The schedule will also allow us to take full advantage of the Renewable Obligation Credit, or ROC, program. We've already secured the key contracts for waste and ROC sales with the same partners at Tees Valley 1, and we're pleased that the U.K. government cabinet office will purchase all the power from Tees Valley 2 under a similar long-term committed price contract.","As a result of the project synergies, the capital cost is roughly 10% lower than Tees Valley 1, and we expect Tees Valley 2 to be more profitable than Tees Valley 1. The 2 projects combined also have very strong asset management opportunities. We're very proud of these projects and the Air Products innovation and expertise that are bringing them to life. These plants offer efficient, clean generation of power from waste. Together, these 2 facilities will create 1,500 construction jobs and 100 permanent jobs, divert as much as 700,000 metric tons of nonrecyclable waste from landfills each year and power as many as 100,000 homes.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 13, and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. Economic activity in the second half of 2013 was slower than we had initially anticipated in most regions. Given the current economic conditions, we are planning for economic growth to be modest again in 2014. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we are forecasting manufacturing growth of 2% to 4%.","In the U.S., uncertainty in the economy remains despite the government restart. The combination of unresolved fiscal challenges, weak job growth, low consumer confidence and diminished global demand are likely to continue to act as a headwind on economic growth despite the positive drivers of lower energy costs and strength in housing. We are forecasting a range of 2% to 4% growth. However, even the low end of the range assumes no significant impact from any potential government shutdown or debt ceiling crisis.","In Europe, challenges remain, with low confidence levels and weak job markets. We are hopeful that we've seen the bottom and anticipate growth of 0% to 2%. This is dependent upon trade-offs between austerity and growth reforms. In Asia, we expect a gradual acceleration in manufacturing growth to continue, particularly in China. However, recent government focus on reform is expected to temper growth. For the region, we expect growth of 5% to 7%.","In South America, we expect growth in the range of 1% to 3%. This is dependent on global economic demand driving the export market.","We expect that Electronics will begin to rebound in 2014 after 2 years of weakness. Overall, for the year, we forecast square inches of silicon process to be up 3% to 5% next year.","Our project development and contract signings continue to be very strong. As Simon mentioned earlier, we've recently announced 2 large hydrogen projects, one in India and one in Canada. You've heard us talk about the increasing demand for hydrogen around the world and increased acceptance of the outsource or sale of gas business model. This represents a great hydrogen opportunity for Air Products.","We also continue to see opportunities in China for oxygen for coal gasification, driven by the government's goal of developing domestic sources of energy and feedstocks utilizing their vast coal reserves. And our LNG business leadership continues with new orders for floating projects, U.S. export terminals, midsized plans, as well as the traditional baseload projects. The new and profitable on-site projects would drive earnings in 2016 and beyond.","Fiscal '14 capital spending is expected to be similar to the $2 billion level we saw in fiscal '13, although we are bidding a number of large and profitable investment opportunities. If a number of these move ahead, we could see our CapEx rise. Our continued success in winning profitable new projects has increased our backlog to $3.5 billion, securing additional future profitable growth. You can see an updated list of our major projects in Appendix Slide 17, along with the geographic and business segment capital spending split on Slide 18.","Now to help you with historical comparisons, Slide 19 in the appendix shows non-GAAP CapEx, which includes capital lease expenditures.","Given our economic outlook for fiscal 2014, our EPS guidance range is $5.70 to $5.90. Walking from our 2013 EPS of $5.50, we have the following factors. New plan onstream should add about $0.20 to $0.25. These are projects that are either onstream now or will be onstream soon and the on-site projects are backed by contractual commitments. This number is slightly below our previous expectations due to project timing and slower merchant floating ramps.","We expect a greater contribution from new plants in FY '15 and FY '16.","The base business should add $0.05 to $0.15 per share through a combination of higher volumes and increased LNG business. The higher volumes in Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials will be the factor most influenced by the economy.","Higher maintenance costs will be about a $0.05 headwind as a significant number of our hydrogen customers have scheduled outages next year.","Our cost reduction efforts should add about $0.15 a share. The shutdown of our PUI business could be a $0.10 headwind. Pension expense will be about a $0.05 tailwind as the rise -- due to the rise of interest rates. We expect taxes, currency and interest costs to be roughly flat to last year. And the number of shares outstanding will increase modestly, resulting in about a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind.","Now let's turn to our first quarter outlook in Slide 14. Our guidance for Q1 is for earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.35 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from new planned onstreams, further progress of our cost reduction initiatives and lower pension costs. Offsetting this sequential improvement, in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials we expect to see lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to seasonally higher maintenance spending and lower volumes as refineries begin taking their annual outages. We will see lower Equipment and Energy profits in the first quarter based on project timing, although we do expect a significant rebound to the rest of the year. Finally, we expect to see an adverse impact from inventory revaluation and lower OIE.","Now let me turn the call back to John to wrap up.","John E. McGlade","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 15. In conclusion, our performance this quarter was driven by our ability to execute effectively on the strategic priorities we set out at the beginning of this year. We continue to stay focused on driving our global competitiveness and improvement in our overall returns and profitability.","Moving into fiscal year 2014, the leadership team and I, with the full support of the board, will continue to move forward aggressively on the priorities we have outlined for our investors, customers and other stakeholders: continued cost reduction and productivity improvement; disciplined project execution; loading of our existing assets; and winning new projects, creating profitable growth to drive shareholder value into the future. And while we do not expect to see some continuing -- while we do expect to see some continuing economic headwinds in fiscal year '14, we also see great opportunities for good projects at attractive returns in our core hydrogen, oxygen for coal gasification, electronics and LNG leadership positions.","Before we turn it over for questions, let me also take this opportunity to welcome the new directors we've recently added to our board: Seifi Ghasemi, Edward Monser and Matthew Paull. The management team and I have met with each of them as part of their onboarding process, and we look forward to the insights these 3 highly qualified individuals bring to Air Products as we work to continue to create value for our shareholders.","In addition, as you all know, I've announced my retirement in 2014, after 38 great years with the company. It's something the board and I have been discussing for some time now as I approach 60 years old. To ensure we find the most qualified CEO candidate, we have formed a search committee and retained a global search firm. Our goal is to have our new CEO in place in the first half of 2014.","And with that, thank you. And now we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Scott, you mentioned that the impact from new plants will also be higher in '15, '16, and '14? Could it be a double the $0.25 number you put out there for '14?","M. Scott Crocco","Yes, David, so if you look at the projects that are in our backlog, I think the impact that we're going to see in '14 moving forward, you could see that doubling in '15 and even higher in '16, again, for those projects that are currently in our backlog. So good ramp-up as we bring those projects onstream. And as a reminder, over 85% of our projects in backlog are take-or-pay terms, so we don't have volume risks. So we feel confident about the growth in earnings, particularly in '15 and '16.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Scott, I would have thought the base business could do more than a $0.05 to $0.15 in 2014, given the loading that you should get on your base business and in Electronics. What's limiting the growth in that base business next year or in 2014?","M. Scott Crocco","So we are in a current situation economically that there's a lot of uncertainty, right? And you heard my comments around each of the different geographies, recognizing that we've begun to see some modest sequential growth, but there's a lot of risk, there's a lot of uncertainty and there's weak confidence. So we are optimistic that we're going to be able to load the facilities, not only from the economy but also our applications. I also mentioned that in that $0.05 to $0.15 is all the base business. So we're driving productivity efforts to offset inflation, and we're trying to manage pricing and offsetting increases in a raw material situation.","Operator","Next we'll move to P.J. Juvekar at Citi.","John Hirt","It's actually John Hirt, filling in for P.J. today. In Electronics and Performance Materials, your operating margins were higher than they've been now for a couple of years. And if I recall, the low end of your 2015 margin target that you talked about in the past is 18% for that segment. Now that you've done some rightsizing, and it sounds like there's more in the pipeline, do you think you've done enough to get to that 18% number?","Simon R. Moore","So John, it's a good question. And obviously, we're very pleased by the improvement in the segment. As we pointed out relative to last year, that was driven by an inventory revaluation last year. But we have seen some sequential strength in the business. And when you look at the year-on-year sales numbers, particularly on Electronics, that's primarily a function of the Equipment business, which is really tied to new fab CapEx. So if you take a look at the on-site business in Electronics, it's doing well. If you take a look at the advanced materials part of Electronics, it's doing well. And you see the decisive actions we're taking to drive improvement in the process materials. At the same time, the Performance Materials part of the business is going well. We said we had good sales growth across all major product lines in all regions, driven by some of our new activity. So we're comfortable and confident that with the changes we're making in Electronics, that segment is positioned well to improve going forward and drive margins improvements.","John Hirt","Okay. And then on the restructuring, if you had to allocate the expected $45 million of benefits that you anticipate for 2014 to your segments, how much would you anticipate falling into Merchant, how much in Electronics and Performance Materials, and how much outside of those 2 segments?","Simon R. Moore","So, yes, it's a great question, John. If I could just follow up with that. So roughly speaking, I mean, in Electronics, we probably see -- I don't know, $10 million, $12 million, $14 million of the savings. Okay? And then the rest of the savings probably will be about 2\/3 Merchant and 1\/3 Tonnage.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could just ask what your cash flow expectations are for '14, both maybe cash flow from operations and then ultimately free cash flow? And I'm just thinking I've seen that higher shares outstanding but I see the interest flat. And how much of those charges are cash-oriented? If you could just reconcile that would be helpful.","M. Scott Crocco","Yes. So this is Scott. So we'd just take a step back and talk briefly about '13. When we look at our cash flow from operations, short of $1.6 million. And then look at PP&E, equity affiliate acquisitions, we define cash flow from operations, less that as free cash flow, we're negative by roughly $200 million, recognizing that we've made a voluntary pension contribution at the beginning of the year for about $220 million. So absent that we're about scratch. I'll also point out that through the course of this year, each quarter we improved the cash flow from operations sequentially quarter-to-quarter, and we're going to continue to focus on that going forward from both loading our existing assets and bringing the projects in the backlog onstream. We would expect next year to be breakeven to probably positively slightly positive from a free cash flow perspective. And in terms of the provision, we've got a fair amount that was paid in this quarter associated with the final contract termination. The lion's share of the provision, though, from an asset perspective, is not going to be cash but rather just the people actions will be cash that we'll see next year.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, on the cylinder demand in Europe, it sounds like the cylinders are starting to come back. Is that something -- could you give a line of sight on where we are? And is that something that sort of took place in this quarter and we shouldn't expect to continue going forward, or how should we be thinking about that?","Simon R. Moore","Yes, Vincent, I think it's really, if you do year-on-year comparisons, right, we're still seeing weakness in the cylinder business. But I think sequentially, as we've said last quarter, we think in general, we're seeing some bottoming and there could be some signs of things starting to improve, but that's something that we definitely want to see some more improvement on next year.","Operator","We'll move next to Don Carson at Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, a question on Merchant loading in the U.S. John, what penalty do you think you'd undergo because of your lack of a cylinder business? I mean, what impact do you think that might have on your loading, and what efforts are you doing to try and offset that? I know you started a Minibulk effort. How successful has that been? Has that helped loading at all in the liquid business? And then just as a follow for Scott, you've outlined how you expect earnings to improve new projects in '15 to '16. How does return on capital unfold? What construction, what's going to be the change in construction progress from year end '13 to '14 and '15?","John E. McGlade","Okay, Don. This is John. Thanks for the questions. Let me take the first one. Certainly I'm not sure we've ever quantified it in the context of a percent. Obviously, if you don't have a packaged gas business, you miss certain parts of the market verticals. However, having said that, and I appreciate you acknowledging it, we've really ramped up our commitment in terms of sales resources, our commitment in terms of Microbulk product offerings, the EPCO acquisition and strong applications, and I believe the 5% or so LOX\/LIN growth you're seeing really is a result of that activity. As we talked, when we started doing that, it takes a little while for these projects from the signings that you bring on to come onstream, but I think we're starting to see that in the P&L. And I actually feel pretty good about the progress that, that team has made. Scott?","M. Scott Crocco","Don, to your return on capital employed comment. So I think first about the backlog, say, last year from a SIP [ph] perspective, maybe it's $1 billion. We end this year maybe $1.3 billion. And given the size of the backlog going forward, maybe it's more like $1.5 billion or so in '14. I would see '14, FY '14, as kind of being roughly flat with '13 from an ROCE bottoming out during the course of the year and then turning and coming up and improving second half of '14 into '15 and '16, as we bring the projects on the backlog. And again, re-emphasize that over 80% of this is in take-or-pay terms, and so that doesn't have the volume.","Operator","And we'll move next to John McNulty at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on the Tees project #2. I believe the first one was going to take $500 million of capital and should have been about $0.10 accretive. So is that the same level -- I know you talked about a 10% discount on the capital side. So should we be thinking about that as $450 million or is it going to be a bigger facility? How should we think about capital requirements for that? And then in terms of the synergies and the opportunities around that, that you mentioned, what does that mean for the EPS accretion?","John E. McGlade","So let me take this, John. So I think you have it captured correctly in terms of we see some execution synergies that will reduce the capital circa the $50 million or so that you mentioned. It also, as Simon mentioned in his words, it really gives us the opportunity, frankly, beyond the cost synergies to take the experienced team that's already executing 1, move them right to 2 and be able to take advantage of the Renewable Obligations Credits at their maximum levels that are out there today. The really exciting parts, though, of this project are the asset management opportunities that 1 offered us that when I mentioned that I was, in my words, that when I was at the site and reviewed with the team and if you just think of putting fundamentally a duplicate size and duplicate process facility next door, you just really get to leverage those up. So I think we would say in total the contribution, when both facilities are lined out, is on the order of $0.25 to $0.30 a share in EPS.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then with regard to the Merchant business, you've got -- you had some pretty decent volume growth, and yet you're still kind of looking at mid-70s utilization rates. I guess, I'm wondering if there's room for any rationalization of any of the existing capacity that you've got there, if that could potentially make sense going forward or not.","Simon R. Moore","Sure, John. I mean, one of the things that I believe I've said in a number of these calls is we always look at the opportunities for portfolio management, whether it be at a segment level or an asset level. And obviously, we're looking at that as we speak. I think, however, what you've got, you have to think about the loadings sort of from a regional perspective because there's different dynamics going on there. If I start in Asia, China largely, the turndown there came sort of as -- quite a bit of capacity was being added to the market in an environment where you had low double-digit growth, and now you've ratcheted that back 300 or 400 basis points. And so I'm pretty comfortable that we'll grow back into that capacity. It's just going to take a few years to do that. Europe, obviously, if the economics scenario we continue to look and ask ourselves where we are on that, and do we have the right assets. And as you've seen and heard, we've taken a lot of actions in Europe both in '13 and then are projecting some additional actions here in '14. In North America, those came down a little more by some of the targeted additions we've brought in. So we mentioned the Oklahoma facility that came into the map, if you will, so that's more of a mathematical issue that, again, I think would be signings that we're achieving in that marketplace, we'll get there. And if I go to Latin America and talk Brazil, specifically, we did bring on a new plant in Brazil that added some incremental capacity, although the primary reason for that was really to shut down a 35, 40-year-old asset, and there was significant productivity benefits from that. And right now, if you go to the sort of the Chile area, a lot of that is export-driven, which is tied to global economies. But I think we're pretty comfortable that, that'll come back on track as the global economies strengthen over the next year or so.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer at Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering 2 things. The first is, if you just go to your Slide 13, where you go through the worldwide manufacturing growth numbers outlooks for next year, where did those come in on your calendar year or your fiscal year? Just so we know kind of what the delta is going forward for the next year if you walk through those for the last 12 months.","M. Scott Crocco","Sure, Duff. This is Scott. So low end of the range, overall, we would say that the global manufacturing growth came in roughly about 2%. Now inside of it, U.S.\/Canada would be at the low end, 2.2% or so. Asia came in about the middle of the range. Europe, being the big disappointment, that came in, call it, 2% negative, so well below the range. And then South America, likewise, is kind of at the low end of the anticipated range. So overall, the manufacturing environment that we saw was the low end, for some regions, particularly Europe below the low end. I'll also point out that from a square inches of silicon perspective, we anticipated in '13 growth of mid-single digits, call it, 4% to 6%. And while we're still looking at what the final numbers come in at on our fiscal year basis, it might be just modestly favorable but nowhere near where we had anticipated.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then if you walk back, you laid out about the same slide 1 year ago. Coming off a base of $5.40 in '12, you expected to grow midpoint $0.35 EPS during the last year. Now looking forward, do you expect to grow $0.30 off of $5.50 base over the next year. But when you look through your growth numbers, Asia and Europe are meaningfully better, and those are 2 very big markets for you as you're look forward over the next year. And probably more important, you put another $2 billion of capital in the ground, which should give you leverage. So I guess, I struggle to see why you would only expect to grow $0.30 over the next year when you expected to grow $0.35 if we go back 1 year over the future year. But yet, things seem to look better both from a macro perspective and certainly much larger from a capital base perspective.","M. Scott Crocco","All right. So if I step back and think about our view last year this time, we anticipated that each of the geographies had bottomed out and we're going to see sequential growth through the course of FY '13 with a particularly strong second half of the year in FY '13. We didn't see it. For each of the different geographies, we kind of saw the slow point, the low point of their manufacturing output sometime during FY 13. U.S., maybe the beginning of the summer. Europe, maybe late winter. And Asia, somewhere in that same timeframe. So from a momentum perspective, we're projecting going forward solid sequential growth, but again, recognizing there's a lot of uncertainty in the economy, but it's off of a lower base than what we had anticipated last year at this time. The other thing, again, that we are focused on are those things that we can control. So given the fact that the economy didn't play out, we delivered on the provision that we took last year, which, as you know, was more focused on Europe. And now, today, we've announced a larger provision that is focused on a variety of different areas, both from a portfolio perspective in Electronics, like we talked about, as well as supply chain, Europe, and then rightsizing in Asia as well. While we see growth in Asia, we have to make sure that we have the right level of resources given the economic environment that we're projecting. And then just lastly, around your comment around the investment that we put in the ground. We look back at the investment that we've made, and the issue is the loading of the merchant investments that we put in the ground compared to the long-term take-or-pay contacts that we have on the Tonnage side. So as we've said in the past, our focus is loading the investments that we've already made and bringing onstream those projects that are in backlog to make sure that we have profitable growth, not only in '14 but also '15 and '16.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Harrison at First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just a couple of questions related to the NF3 capacity rationalization. How much capacity is going to be taken out at the hometown plant? What portion of the total NF3 production does that represent? And are we just seeing some lower demand overall driving the overcapacity, or are you starting to see competition from increasing use of on-site fluoride?","Simon R. Moore","It's a good question, Mike. So first of all, we are really not seeing any penetration of on-site fluorine. That's being talked about in the industry for at least 10 year, and we have not seen any significant impact. As Scott mentioned, what has really driven the NF3 supply demand dynamics is the lack of expected growth from PV. That was expected to grow and use up a fair amount of NF3. It hasn't happened. So over the last year or so, you've been hearing us talk a little bit more about volume pressure and price pressure. So we've taken an action to rationalize some capacity in the U.S. We're still going to manufacture in the U.S. There are still demand for NF3 in the U.S., but we expect to take about 20% to 25% out of our NF3 global manufacturing footprint with these actions.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then looking at the weakness in Asia Merchant pricing. Last quarter, you had noted some competitive pressures you saw. It looks like those may have intensified this quarter. Are those pressures showing any signs of easing? And are you guys working to increase the amount of Merchant sales under contract as opposed to selling through wholesalers in China?","Simon R. Moore","It's a great question, Mike. And really, I'm glad you've made that last point because that's a really interesting dynamic in China. That isn't as common in other regions for the Merchant business, and that's the presence of the wholesale market. So a couple of things here. First of all, existing Chinese on-site customers, who also build some liquid capacity, when they're running hard, particularly a steel mill, they'll use up all their own capacity and sometimes actually import some product. When they're not running so hard not only do they not import, but they can export as well. And you have a set of folks who play kind of a wholesale place in the supply chain there. So there is more volume\/price dynamic in the wholesale market in China than we see -- there isn't a similar market in other regions. So we would not be surprised to see a little bit more volume\/price changes as a result of the wholesale market. To answer the other part of your question, we absolutely are working hard and are increasing, if you will, the retail side of the business, but at the same time acknowledging the wholesale market is a good place to move product, particularly when assets are unloaded.","John E. McGlade","And I think this isn't too unusual if you think about the evolution of the various markets across the globe. The more mature markets have gone pretty much to the industry -- the customers who supply for the industry. You're going to have this mix for a while, but it's something I think we understand and absolutely something we'll be driving to the points that Simon made as it relates to how we contract and how we make investment decisions in that market going forward.","John Hirt","And just to get to the crux of the question though, are the competitive pressures easing and you're seeing some improvement in the pricing dynamics or not really?","John E. McGlade","I would say it continues to be a competitive market, Mike.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mike Sison of KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of, I just wanted to get your perspective. You have another year under your belt in thinking about this 20% operating margin goal that you have out there. Do you feel better about Air Products potentially getting there? Any structural reasons that hinder that potential longer term? And I'm not going to pin you on when, but when you think about that goal, is it still something that you think the company can get to?","John E. McGlade","Yes. Well, from my perspective, those goals were put at a time where we expected a much different economic environment. I think the important thing, though, for us to focus on is our return on capital employed. And as Scott mentioned earlier, we, when we begin to bring these new on-sites on and put it behind us given the stepped-up investment that we have, I see a way to continuing to improve our return on capital employed and moving towards one of the industry-leading return on capital employed numbers out there from a spread over our cost of capital. And so looking forward, if I look at our portfolio, if I look at how we position the business, the world sort of played out a little differently than we anticipated. But on the plus side, the opportunities in some of our leading marketplaces like tonnage and hydrogen and electronics have played out better.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And a quick follow-up, Scott, maybe on the new projects, the $0.20, $0.25. It sounds like maybe Merchant is going to be a bigger portion of that than we might have thought in the past as some of the tonnage got pushed out. Any thoughts on the split between the 2?","M. Scott Crocco","There's a lot of Tonnage in there. I mean, recognizing that as the backlog gets worked in, as we mentioned, previously the split was more evenly balanced Merchant and Tonnage, but recently the backlog has been over 80% -- 80%, 85%. And so it's a combination of both, but there's a heavy element of take-or-pay terms. And so we feel good about that volume growth projection from new assets into '14 as well as '15 and '16.","Simon R. Moore","John?","John E. McGlade","Yes. Let me just wrap up by saying, first, thanks to Audra, and then conclude with saying our focus on increasing shareholder value remains unwavering. Our emphasis on cost reduction, productivity improvement and disciplined project execution remains key priorities. Our future prospects are strong given our record project backlog and a significant leverage in our existing assets.","Please go to our website to access the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today.

[Operator Instructions]","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.","Simon R. Moore","Thank you, Lea. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' third quarter earnings teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our Q3 results and outlook for the remainder of 2012. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website.","Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release explaining factors that may affect these expectations.","Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Please turn to Slide #3. Before we get into the quarter's operating results, I want to spend a few moments reviewing a few key items affecting this quarter's numbers. First, the sale of our Continental European Homecare business closed, and included in our quarter 3 discontinued operations results is an after-tax gain of $150 million, or $0.70 per share.","Regarding the remaining European Homecare business located in the U.K. and Ireland, we have received bids from several interested parties, and we expect to close on the sale of the remaining business before the end of calendar 2012. Quarter 3 results include an after-tax charge of $30 million, or $0.14 per share, in discontinuing operations to adjust the book value of the remaining Homecare business to its estimated net realizable value.","As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 50% of our DA NanoMaterials joint venture at the beginning of April. Included in this quarter's results is a $55 million, or $0.25 per share, after-tax gain. This represents the gain on our previously held 50% ownership. This acquisition supports our strategy of delivering a portfolio of differentiated offerings to our semiconductor customers.  Excluding these items, our adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations is $1.41 for the quarter, within our $1.40 to $1.45 guidance range. Good performance, given the weaker economy and unfavorable currency impacts, driven by a stronger dollar.","To help you with the quarterly comparisons, Slide #14 in the appendix shows earnings per share from continuing operations x disclosed items for the past 2 years. We are on track with our cost reduction plans, and in fact, saw about $4 million of benefit in this past quarter. As we said last quarter, most of the actions should be completed by the end of our fiscal year.","In quarter 4, the savings should more than offset the approximately $6 million of quarterly stranded costs generated by the Homecare divestiture. When fully implemented in 2013, we expect the cost-reduction plan to provide $60 million of annual savings.","Now let's turn to our operating results. Please turn to Slide #4. Overall results were within our expectations. However, weaker economic growth prevented our volumes from growing as much as we had forecast, and we had headwinds from the stronger dollar. While our forecast for stronger demand in the second half of fiscal year 2012 did not come true, we are pleased that our strong operating and cost performance drove improved margins broadly.","The European recession continues, and conditions worsened this quarter. Growth in China has slowed, and the seasonal rebound in electronics and other industries has been weaker than expected. For the quarter, sales of $2.3 billion were 5% lower versus prior year, primarily due to lower energy pass-through and a stronger dollar, particularly against the euro.","Underlying sales increased 1% year-on-year, primarily due to higher pricing in Merchant Gases. Higher Tonnage Gases volumes and higher Equipment segment sales were offset by lower volumes in both Merchant Gases and Electronics.","Sequentially, overall sales were unchanged. Underlying sales increased 1% on higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments, offset by lower equipment sales, and the DA NanoMaterials acquisition contributed 1%. Simon will provide segment and geographic details later.","In spite of the weak volumes and unfavorable currency, operating income of $397 million increased 2% from the prior year due to excellent cost performance. This is the result of better planned operations and fewer turnarounds reducing maintenance spending and the positive impact of our cost-reduction plan in Europe.","Sequentially, operating income was also up 6% on improved cost performance. Our operating margin improved to 17%, up 130 basis points versus prior year. Sequentially, our operating margin improved 100 basis points.","Net income was up 2% versus last year and 8% sequentially. Diluted earnings per share increased by 3% versus last year and 8% sequentially. Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous or run-rate basis is 12.2%. On an annual basis, return on capital employed is 12.5%.","Returning -- turning now to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share of $1.41 increased by $0.04 versus last year. Volumes decreased earnings per share by $0.04. Like last quarter, the mix impact of volumes was the principal factor. Unfavorable volumes in Merchant and Electronics were only partially offset by favorable volumes in Tonnage and Performance Materials.","Also, lower-margin air separation unit sales replaced higher-margin LNG heat exchanger sales in our Equipment and Energy segment. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together increased earnings per share by $0.02. And as I mentioned, excellent cost performance was $0.10 favorable.","Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together were $0.05 unfavorable. Equity affiliate income was $0.01 higher due to strong volumes from our Mexican affiliate. Our effective tax rate was about 1% higher, which reduced earnings per share by $0.02. And finally, fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.02.","Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 6, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of $874 million were down 5% versus prior year, driven by the negative currency effect. Underlying sales were flat, with 2% positive pricing offsetting lower volumes.","Sales were down 1% sequentially, again, driven by currency as volume gains of 1% were offset by lower pricing. Merchant Gases operating income of $165 million was up 4% versus prior year and up 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.8% was up 160 basis points compared to last year and up 150 basis points sequentially.","Versus last year, operating income was up on higher pricing across all the regions and better cost performance. Our distribution and production systems ran more efficiently, and we began to see the benefit of our restructuring program in Europe. Versus prior quarter, positive volume growth offset lower pricing, with better cost performance improving profits and margins.","Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In U.S.\/Canada, sales were up 1% on positive pricing. Overall, volumes were flat, with liquid oxygen\/liquid nitrogen up slightly, liquid hydrogen up and argon and helium down as supply availability limited sales. As we mentioned last quarter, we report Mexico as an equity affiliate, so neither the volumes nor sales are included here. If we included Mexico with U.S.\/Canada, our overall North America LOX\/LIN volumes would be up 3% on strong oil and gas injection volumes in Mexico.","Unfortunately, we did not see any improvement in the helium situation this quarter. Supply challenges continue in both the U.S. and Algeria. We expect the situation to improve in FY '13, helped by the onstream of our new Riley Ridge facility and other new sources we are exploring.","Argon supply was also limited this quarter as reduced oxygen demand for steel impacted argon co-production. We are working to expand argon production but expect supply limitations to extend into next year. Pricing was up 1%. LOX\/LIN\/LAR was flat, liquid hydrogen was down on lower natural gas costs, and helium was up. Contract signings were the strongest in 4 years and are well above target year-to-date, providing confidence for growth next year. LOX\/LIN capacity utilization improved slightly but remains in the low 70s.","In Europe, sales were down 12% versus last year, primarily due to currency, with underlying sales down 2%. Volumes were down 4% on weaker end-market demand for both liquid\/bulk and packaged gases, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Helium volumes were down on supply availability.  Pricing was 2% positive, with strength broadly across the businesses. LOX\/LIN plant loadings remain in the low 80s, and new contract signings slowed but we are still ahead of our target year-to-date.","In Asia, sales were up 6% versus last year on positive volume and price. Overall, volumes were up 4%. LOX\/LIN volumes, excluding conversions, were up 7%, and packaged gas volumes continue to show strength across both our base business and the microbulk product line. Pricing was up 3% on strength in helium and packaged gases. Plant loadings remain in the high 70s as new capacity additions offset the volume growth. New contract signings remain strong, and we are above target year-to-date.","During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of a majority position in Indura, the largest independent industrial gas company in Latin America. Combined with our existing business in Brazil and our Mexico joint venture, Air Products will be the second-largest industrial gas producer in Latin America, a region second in growth only to Asia. We closed on the purchase of approximately 65% of Indura in early July, and we'll be including Indura in our results beginning in our fourth quarter. We are very excited about the great opportunities we see as we join the Indura team's local expertise with Air Products' global experience.","Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $767 million were down 12% versus last year, driven by a negative 12% impact from lower energy pass-through. Volumes were up 2%, primarily on new projects, and currency negatively impacted sales by 2%. Sequentially, sales were down 2%, driven by a negative 3% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 1% impact from currency. Volumes were up 2%, again, primarily on new projects.","Operating income of $134 million was up 17% versus prior year on the higher volumes and lower operating and maintenance costs. Operating income was up 7% sequentially as higher volumes and lower maintenance costs more than offset the anticipated impact of lower annual operating bonuses.","Operating margin of 17.5% improved 430 basis points versus prior year and 150 basis points sequentially, primarily on the higher operating income. Lower energy pass-through contributed 80 of the 430-basis-point improvement versus prior year and 30 of the 150 basis points sequentially. The primary driver of improved margins was the lower costs.","In terms of new business, we announced another contract to provide additional hydrogen to Motiva's Convent, Louisiana refinery from our industry-leading Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system. We have supplied Motiva for many years, and this is the second instance where our new Gulf Coast pipeline connection allows us to provide flexibility for Motiva to take product at multiple locations along the pipeline, certainly something Motiva values.","Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $604 million were flat versus last year, with growth from our DA Nano joint venture acquisition offsetting 1% lower volumes, 1% lower pricing and a negative 2% impact from currency. Sequentially, sales were up 6% on higher volumes in the acquisition.","Electronics sales were up 2% versus last year. Excluding the acquisition, electronic materials sales were down versus last year as expected with lower semiconductor production. On-site and equipment sales were slightly higher. Sales were up 10% sequentially, with the acquisition adding to higher base business.","In general, electronics materials pricing was relatively stable, but we continue to see pricing pressure in xylene. The overall photovoltaic market and specifically thin-film PV have not developed as was expected a few years ago. Thin-film PV was expected to be a significant consumer of xylene and, as a result, market demand has not grown to match new industry xylene production capacity.","Performance Materials sales were down 2% versus last year as volume growth was offset by lower prices, and currency had a negative 2% impact. Volumes were positive in North America and Asia but weaker in Europe. Sequentially, sales were up 2% on volume improvement across all the regions.","Operating income of $91 million was down 17% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 310 basis points to 15%, primarily on lower volumes and pricing. Sequentially, operating income was up 6%, and operating margin was down 10 basis points as the sales growth was primarily driven by the acquisition.","In Electronics, we just announced a major contract from Samsung to supply their new fabs in Xi'an, China. This is Samsung's largest-ever overseas investment, expected to be over $7 billion. Air Products will build plants to supply Samsung and provide liquid products to the merchant market in the region. This significant contract enhances Air Products' leading supply position with Samsung and the semiconductor industry. We also announced a new contract with Xiamen Tianma Microelectronics for the supply of bulk gases to their new TFT-LCD facility in Fujian Province.","Now please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $95 million were up 19% versus prior year, primarily on higher ASU project activity. Sequentially, sales were down 14%, primarily on lower LNG project activity. Operating income of $10 million was up 14% versus prior year as better project cost performance overcame the mix effect. Sequentially, income was flat.","Backlog is up 76% over last year and up 39% over last quarter, driven by our recent LNG awards to the highest level in more than 5 years. As we've been seeing, LNG bidding activity remains strong. We are pleased to have announced an agreement to supply equipment and technology to the PETRONAS Floating LNG project, 180 kilometers off the coast of Bintulu, Malaysia. This is our second floating LNG equipment order, and we are excited about the opportunities in this new area.","We also shipped a 100th LNG heat exchanger from our Pennsylvania facility earlier this month. Our proprietary and industry-leading technology is helping meet the world's need for clean energy in 15 countries around the world.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 11. Now let me give you a brief summary of our outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we did not see the expected second half global economic recovery. We have also seen a stronger U.S. dollar than we forecast. Looking forward, we expect that economic growth will continue to be below our original expectations. While U.S. manufacturing has been an economic bright spot, recently, we have seen growth start to slow as consumer confidence remains low, job creation disappoints and concern grows regarding the potential fiscal cliff at the end of the calendar year.","European problems continue, and we do not expect a return to growth any time soon. In Asia, we have not yet seen the impact of Chinese stimulus actions, and the rest of developing Asia continues to experience below-trend growth as exports to Europe and the U.S. are slow.","Electronics growth should continue this quarter. Overall, for the year, we expect square inches of silicon processed to be down about 10%. On the positive side, our project development and contract signings continue to be very strong. A number of these orders are in China for gasification of coal. These projects are driven by the country's need for a cleaner domestic source of energy.","We expect 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.9 billion, including about $700 million for the Indura equity. This will be up about 40% over last year, excluding Indura. Our project backlog has stayed consistent, at about $2.8 billion, which will deliver future profitable growth. You can see an updated list of our major projects in the appendix, Slide #13. To help you with historical comparisons, Slide #15 in the appendix shows non-GAAP capital expenditures, which includes capital lease expenditures. This is on the same basis as our $2.9 billion guidance for 2012.","Now let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook. Our guidance for quarter 4 is for earnings per share of $1.42 to $1.47 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see Merchant Gases volume improvement, particularly in Asia. Electronics should see sequential volume growth. We will see further benefits from the implementation of our cost-restructuring program, and the improved LNG backlog should increase equipment results next quarter.","Partially offsetting this sequential improvement, the Indura acquisition is expected to be about $0.02 dilutive in quarter 4 as we will recognize the transaction costs and asset write-up. We expect the U.S. dollar will remain strong. We also will see higher power prices and lower cryogenic plant efficiencies due to high summer temperatures. Therefore, we expect our earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.45 for the fiscal year, up 1% to 2% versus last year.","Our guidance for the full year is lower by about $0.11 per share, on average, for the last half of the fiscal year. This decline is due to a stronger dollar, which has lowered our earnings by about $0.06 from our expectations last quarter. The Indura acquisition will reduce earnings by $0.02. Slower economic growth has reduced our forecast by approximately $0.08. And costs, as a partial offset, are favorable by about $0.05.","Now let me wrap up. While economic growth continued to disappoint and currency headwinds were greater than expected, we are pleased with the strong cost performance delivered this quarter. We also have taken several portfolio actions to improve our business in the future, including selling our Continental European Homecare business and the Indura and DA Nano acquisitions.","As we look beyond next quarter, we have a number of significant opportunities. Both our U.S. and Asia Merchant Gases business have installed capacity to sell. When manufacturing picks up, we will have the capacity to serve it. We are on track on our European cost reductions, and our productivity efforts worldwide are delivering results.","Our capital expenditures continue to increase, and we expect to announce more projects before the end of the year. And LNG project interest is at an all-time high, and we expect the LNG project backlog to continue to grow. 2012 has certainly offered its challenges. Our focus is on meeting these challenges and achieving our 2015 goals.","Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Lea to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What was your tonnage hydrogen growth in the quarter?","Paul E. Huck","The growth in volumes, Jeff, was a couple of percent. We didn't have anything new come on in this quarter.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What's your outlook for volume growth in tonnage hydrogen for the fourth quarter and for next year?","Paul E. Huck","If we look at for the fourth quarter, we think the hydrogen growth should pick up in this quarter, principally because the refinery should run hard with the driving season in the summer, we think. So, that ought to be a favorable impact. As far as for next year, as we look at it, we'll have more to say to that. But it should be for gross, probably in the mid to high single digits, Jeff. We'll have more to say about that in the 4Q.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Jim Sheehan sitting in for David. And just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in Asia and specifically China on Merchant pricing. What is your outlook for trends in Merchant pricing going forward?","Paul E. Huck","Simon, you want to take that?","Simon R. Moore","Sure. So I think when we talk about pricing in Asia and China, it's actually a pretty good story. We saw good volume growth and we saw decent pricing in Asia. As we said, the volume growth perhaps not as great as we would've liked and would've expected. We've seen announced some of the China stimulus actions. We need those to translate into activity. And of course, in our Merchant segment, the volumes are affected by what's going on in electronics as well. So we continue to see some decent pricing in China and in Asia overall, and we'd expect that to continue.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And on Electronics, I guess the expected return -- rebound in year-over-year comparisons is taking a lot -- a little bit longer than expected, and you made some comments about what you thought about Q4. Is there any basis for additional optimism for 2013? Or are you expecting trends to remain pretty consistent over the next 6 months or so?","Paul E. Huck","I think a good portion of that, Jim, goes with how people feel from a consumer standpoint. And so we have consumers in the U.S. and Europe and in China who right now, as we track these consumer confidence indices, which don't feel great. And so if -- and once we remove some of the uncertainty, which exists around the world, I think we'll see better pickups on those things. But for right now I think everyone is being cautious. They're waiting for the outcomes of the U.S. elections and policy decisions on things and to see how Europe resolves itself with those things. There's a little too much uncertainty in the world right now. All that said, I would not paint the economic situation as horrible. It is just slow for us.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just in Europe, you mentioned volume growth slowing a little bit there, and then your outlook is basically for more of the same. Just wondering if you're seeing any signs of stabilization in Europe yet.","Paul E. Huck","As far as being stable, I mean, it is not diving -- things are not diving down. We are still seeing decreases from a volume standpoint overall in certain countries, especially places like Spain, of 3% to 4% with those things. So it has been tough from -- on a volume standpoint in Europe for us. But we haven't seen that start to level off from an economic standpoint, and we're going to need that to happen sometime soon before we can return to some growth there in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unknown Analyst","Paul for Kevin. I just wanted to follow up on the new business signings in Merchant Gases in the U.S. When do you expect to see volume growth flow through from that momentum?","Paul E. Huck","We would expect to start to see the volumes pick up in -- probably from the signings in this quarter, probably sometime toward the end of the first quarter, the beginning of quarter 2 of next year. It normally takes 6 to 9 months to bring our customers onstream with those things. Now, we have had momentum for a few quarters now, so we would expect to see volumes improve in quarter 4 in the U.S. with things. And to be honest with you, our volumes were pretty good in the U.S. x the supply constraints, which we had, and Simon mentioned, we had supply constraints in helium and argon. If we look at that overall, we think our underlying growth in the U.S. probably would have been about 3% to 4%, if those supply constraints weren't there. So you can look at that as an upside for us. If we can get out of the -- out from under the supply constraints, which is going to take us a while, it's going to take us some quarters to get past there. But there's some growth there for us to harvest.","Unknown Analyst","All right. And as a follow-up, in the U.S. Gulf, when you flip that pipeline on or connect the 2, what impact do you expect to see right off the bat on the P&L?","Paul E. Huck","The impact on the P&L is not going to be great initially. We are going to have some more product which we can sell, and we have pretty much sold that. So we have people who are coming onstream as we look in our plannings for -- on signings on the pipeline. So that's going to happen over 2013. You're obviously going to see the depreciation of the pipeline coming in as a negative, but we'll also be able to run the pipeline better -- to run this, and not the pipeline, but to run the system better. That's going to take us some time to learn how to do that, but we think the efficiency gains on the system are going to be pretty good, because we'll be able to always run our most efficient plants and be able to cross volumes across the Louisiana system and the Gulf Coast system right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I've got 2 questions for you. First, could you go into a little bit more detail on the cost performance just in terms of the splitting it out between -- I guess what I'm thinking about is, how much of it is a function of restructuring? How much of it was a functioning of sort of your operating efficiency? And how much of it should we be carrying forward as we go into future quarters? And what other, if any, new opportunities do you see there?","Paul E. Huck","Yes. So if you take a look at the things that happened from a restructuring benefit, as Simon said, we had about $0.01 per share benefit from the restructuring. So it was overall $0.10, which we got from costs. If you then -- and if you look at that remaining $0.09 a share, about half of that came from variable cost efficiencies. And so that's us running our plants better, our power, our -- the natural gas for hydrogen using less for that to make hydrogen, saving on diesel fuel, et cetera, and about -- and the other half of that comes from lower spending, principally on maintenance in the operations area.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So when we think going forward, I assume the $0.01 should be getting larger as we move forward, right, as you move forward into the restructuring program? And then the question is, just how much of the balance of the $0.09 can you continue perpetually? Is that fair?","Paul E. Huck","We -- yes. And I don't think we saw anything unusual about the $0.09 going forward here. And so we think that, that's going to continue. And we think we can build upon that.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, terrific. And if I could just ask one other question. You've got 5 major projects that, on Slide 13, you have listed as the first half of fiscal '13. I'm just wondering if you can give us any sort of update on any of those projects leaning more towards the beginning of the first half or the end of the first half or anything we should be thinking about for that.","Paul E. Huck","Yes. Well, if you look at them -- if I look at them overall, I would say about those 5, about half and half roughly. Then when you look at these things, half come onstream in the first quarter, the other half come onstream in the second quarter for us right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of new projects this year, I think the expectation was supposed to add $0.30 to $0.35 in EPS. Is that roughly what it's going to contribute this year in '12? And would you see that number increasing, staying about the same, going down in 2013?","Paul E. Huck","It did, Mike, in 2012, so we did see that. And so the thing, which we haven't seen is -- we've actually seen areas, such as Europe, offload from us. But the new projects did contribute that. If we then take a look at 2013, we think we get a similar to maybe a slightly larger amount in 2013.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Paul, I think you or maybe Simon noted that packaged gases is still seeing some strength. Was that primarily in the U.S.? And could you sort of give us a reason why that market has held up?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. So Mike, good question. I think there, we were referring to Asia for packaged gases. Obviously, not having the U.S. business in Europe, packaged gases really being relatively weak. So that was primarily an Asia comment, and it's both on our, if you will, our base Packaged Gas business as well as strength in our marketable product line.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And last question, you also noted weaker demand in steel for oxygen. Was that on a sequential basis? And is that -- did that sort of get a little bit weaker as the quarter unfolded?","Paul E. Huck","It did, as the quarter came through. We think it's going to continue in the summer also, Mike. And it is weaker sequentially and weaker year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","John Hirt","This is John Hirt on for P.J. this morning. In Merchant, it sounds like you'll be facing helium and argon supply challenges for another quarter or maybe even longer. Can you give us a sense of what the margin drag that is having currently and how much benefit you could get in FY '13 once those issues are resolved?","Paul E. Huck","Yes. And John, I don't know if it's having as big a drag on margin as it's having on growth because the industry is tied in helium, the industry is tied in argon, in the U.S. particularly, is where we're talking about argon, and the discussion on helium go worldwide. But the prices of both have been up for us. So from a margin percent standpoint, there has been a drag. As I said, if you take a look at the U.S., we think that it probably cut back 3% to 4% on our growth within the U.S. in those 2 areas. And that's about a $1 billion-a-year business for us, so that's somewhere between $30 million and $40 million in sales. The contribution margins of those products are probably up in the 40% range for us, so you can see what the impact of that is for us.","John Hirt","Okay, that's helpful. And in Electronics, can you just talk about the trends that you're seeing across each of your end markets: semis, LCDs, PV, and kind of how do you see that playing out for the rest of the year?","Paul E. Huck","Simon, do you want...","Simon R. Moore","Sure. And I think, as always, we talk mostly about the semiconductor market because as you remember, that's about 80% of our business. So we made a reference to PV, which is really quite weak right now. That's only about 5% of our business. TFT-LCD is fairly flat, not showing a lot of growth. That's only about 10% of our business. In the semiconductor, the external forecast that we see are forecasting a drop for our FY '12 of about 10% to 11%. So Q3 was better than Q2. It was worse than Q3 last year. We expect kind of the same story for Q4 that things will be better than they were in Q3 but worse than they were in Q4 last year. I think one of the key points though is, again, as we talked many times, is our strength. We're the industry leaders. Our electronics sales were up 1% through 3 quarters, while the industry was down, and as I've said, in the low double digits. Intel's CapEx continues to be up significantly over last year. TSMC's Q2 sales were up about 20%, stronger than the industry. Certainly, both those folks are commenting about maybe there's a little bit of weakness in Q4 and Q1. But, again, Intel, Samsung and TSMC, where we're the leading supplier, are going to spend the majority of the industry's CapEx in this year. So that helps us grow going forward.","John Hirt","Okay. And where are your NF3 operating rates currently?","Simon R. Moore","So NF3 operating rates are probably in about the 80% range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob this morning. With some of the slowing macro numbers coming out of China, I was wondering if you've seen any kind of deferral or a little bit lengthening in the pipeline for new contract signings there or any signs of customers wanting to defer the timing of new projects coming online over there.","Paul E. Huck","We have not seen that occur. And on the -- in the speech portion of this teleconference, one of the things that I talked about was that really the drive for gasification projects is to give them a clean source of energy in China, so it's really an infrastructure project and less tied to the economic growth of the country there.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the Tonnage volume, I think you mentioned there was maybe a negative currency impact to the volumes in some regions. Which regions and maybe end markets were you talking about specifically there?","Paul E. Huck","Europe.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's in Europe.","Paul E. Huck","Europe, yes, on Tonnage. It wasn't on volume. It was on sales activity. It was on sales that Simon talked about.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And are you seeing any of your customers in Europe on the Tonnage side start to come close their minimum take on their take-or-pay contracts?","Paul E. Huck","We have not seen that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Gulley with Gulley & Associates.","Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC","Yes. Now that you've closed the Indura acquisition, can you comment a little bit about the earnings accretion you might enjoy for fiscal '13?","Paul E. Huck","Yes. And so I can't give you some more -- the comments on that, Mark. And the comments will get better as we get the -- a good look at the write-up, which is going to happen. As you know, we have to have a third party take a look at our -- at the company and do the write-up. But as we look at the accretion dilution impacts for 2013 for Indura, we would expect that to be somewhere around $0.05 to $0.10 right now, depending upon what happens with the asset write-up for us.","Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC","Okay, turning to Tonnage, if I can. You reported a 2% volume gain in the quarter. Can you break that down, as you often do, between base tonnage volumes and how much you enjoyed from new plant startups?","Simon R. Moore","Mark, really, that was almost all from new plant startups. The base volumes were fairly consistent.","Paul E. Huck","Overall, yes, overall.","Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC","Okay. And then finally on Tonnage, the maintenance expenses kind of jump up and down a little bit, and so the margin or the operating income gain we saw in the quarter, how much of that was due to a lower than, let's say, normal maintenance expenses? And -- or how much is really true underlying operating income growth that you might see into fiscal '13?","Paul E. Huck","I think, as far as the maintenance expenses for this quarter, they were low. It's always hard to put a number around whether that was the right number or not. We had good performance. We expect good performance in quarter 4. We would expect the spending to kick up in quarters 1 and quarters 2, because they're normally higher as far as the expenditures are concerned on turnarounds. But the performance in that area was good, Mark. So I think, overall, we have had a good couple of quarters in a row now on the spending in that area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","You had mentioned that you weren't seeing any slowing in China tonnage projects, primarily because you're still seeing gasification being a new driver. I was just wondering, given the discussion about the potential of shale gas in China, how might that impact the gasification opportunity over time? And are you expecting that as we get into the later part of this decade, that maybe the coal gasification opportunity isn't as big as you might have expected a couple of years ago?","Paul E. Huck","We have taken a look at that, Mike, and we think that shale gas -- actually, if the findings are large, which is still a question mark, and it's going to take a while to get there for China, but that it would first eat into the LNG sales into China. And that the gasification projects are really intended to get at the energy independence aspect of things, and that shale gas would replace LNG right now. That would be our view. So we don't see a lot of that curling back, trying to cut back on that. Now the gasification opportunity, we also think, is not going to always be there. We think there's a lot of development around that, because China has the coal. They want to use the coal. Gasification is a good way to use that coal. It makes it easier to transport the coal. It also makes it more environmentally sound. But we think that those gasification opportunities occur basically between now and 2020, and I don't know what happens after that. We'll see what -- and we'll see what things happen. But there's still a lot of those opportunities there going forward. They're putting in place the infrastructure to do that, so we feel sound that those projects are going to continue regardless of what happens to shale gas. Because shale gas actually is a play probably out in the late portion of the decade, which we're now in.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then in terms of the Merchant volume trends, particularly on the liquid side of Merchant, just wondering if you can comment on what you saw across the 3 geographies in kind of June versus May and thus far in July versus June. Are you seeing any deceleration as you look across those geographies?","Paul E. Huck","We are not seeing a deceleration across the geographies of the trends right now. So Europe is -- has continued to move down, and we would expect that happening. Asia has started to move up, particularly in China. It's early to call that. We hope that, that continues. But we are optimistic about that, and that's a factor which I've called out in the guidance. The U.S. still is -- the forecast we have is for growth to be slow for us, but we do expect to see growth in the U.S. sequentially.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then last question, Paul, is just on the share repurchase activity during Q3. How much did you repurchase? What was the share count at the end of the quarter? And can you remind me what your -- what's remaining on the authorization and how you might expect to deploy that, given the Indura acquisition?","Paul E. Huck","So we did not repurchase any shares in this past quarter -- in quarter 3. We did, in quarter 2, repurchase $53 million as far as those -- as far as shares are concerned. Our diluted share count is like 214.7 million or so, I think, for us. And if we look at going forward, given Indura as we said last quarter, we would not expect to be in market and buying back shares.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","So the quarter-on-quarter decline in share count was purely the impact of activity during Q2?","Paul E. Huck","Well, yes, yes. It was the impact of quarter 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Alina Khaykin ","Yes. This is actually Alina on for John. Quick question on the Merchant business. It seems like you guys have been a lot in terms of operating efficiency and cost cutting. So 2 things. One, how much more kind of low-hanging fruit do you have left there? And it also seems like, how much of the cultural change is internally, how much more do you have to go in that area?","Paul E. Huck","Alina, as far as we are concerned, there's probably not a lot of things, which I would call low-hanging fruit. I think we got them more back in the '90s to a great extent. But as far as changes are concerned, and we still see a lot of it, I believe, to make changes and to use and to run the system and gain efficiencies. And so a lot of that gets around trying to use the data we have in SAP and continuing to improve the tools we have to make our deliveries more efficient, to open up windows and things like that and operate better, both our plants and the distribution system itself, and also for better ways to serve and interact with our customers electronically. So we continue on this journey every day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. Paul, a question on going back to U.S. Merchant. I mean, you've talked about some time now about additional signings, building up your mini-bulk sales force. And I'm just wondering why we're not seeing more and more volume from this activity. Can you kind of tell us when you really expect volumes to pick up, how those signings are going? And speaking of Merchant overall, if you do get some of this volume growth next year, would you -- and the cost cuts that you're taking in Europe, would you expect to get back to and beyond your old 20% operating margin target in the Merchant business?","Paul E. Huck","The answer on that -- on the last question is yes, Don. And we do expect to get above that 20% target in this business here. With regard to the volumes, as I said before, I think we -- our growth would've been about 3% to 4% in this past quarter if we didn't have the supply constraints. So that's one of the things which we have to fix, that we have to get more access to more argon. We're taking steps to do that. We have to get access to more helium. We're taking steps to do that. It's not going to all happen in one quarter. It's going to something which is going to unfold over 2013 for us as we work those -- as we work our options there for us. With regard to the signings which we're seeing, we are also seeing a number of customers go away. And that's occurring for a couple of reasons: number one, lower power prices have moved some of our food business out, as people have chosen to go to mechanical freezing; number two, oilfield services has been slow in the Appalachia area. And principally there because of -- it's mainly dry gas, and the rigs have moved out of there and moved to the Bakken. We have seen a pickup in that area for those things, but they're still drilling and so they've got -- it's a while before some of the frac-ing will -- and will pick up out there. But we do have a new plant going on -- going out to serve the mid-Continent area, so we feel good that we're going to have some growth from that in the future. With regard to the other aspect of signings, growth overall within the U.S. has been slow from a process manufacturer's standpoint. Steel growth has been tempered. Petrochemical growth has been tempered and mainly because the new plants aren't onstream yet in those areas. And so as we look to the future, we think there's lots of opportunities for us. But we got to get the economy moving a little bit stronger.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Well, I guess I'm a little confused because your rates have languished in the low 70s since the beginning of the upturn in mid-'09, your competitors in the low 80s now. So I would have thought that -- I mean, they've seen many of these same problems. I would have thought your signings would've closed some of that gap by now.","Paul E. Huck","Yes. And they should have, Don. But as I've said, we have also seen business move away from that, and that's been the issue. There have been a number of people who have stopped using products or who have gone out of business for us and shut down.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up. Speaking of gaps with your competitors, your stock continues to be at quite a high historical gap with Praxair. I know you've bought Indura. You've got additional CapEx requirements, but you still got room in your balance sheet, it would seem, to lever up and buy back stock here, what would seem to be an attractive price if all your growth plans do come to fruition. So just if you can comment on why you're not buying back stock anymore.","Paul E. Huck","Yes. And the reason why is because of the way in which we're going to run the company. We're going to maintain an A bond rating. As we look at this, we don't have room to buy back stock and maintain the A bond rating for us. If we did, I would be in the market to do that. But we want to maintain the flexibility to operate. And we think that is best when -- at an A bond rating for ourselves.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. One, on -- often, when you discuss pricing in -- for on-site projects, you talk about sort of the substitution costs that the customers face. As the customers see their -- as the large customers see their cost of capital coming down, are you seeing more pushback on pricing for projects?","Paul E. Huck","No. We are not seeing them favor the main case anymore than that, typically.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as you look at the U.S. economy, how would you gauge the sort of -- your sensitivity to possibly triggering a round of productivity in the U.S.? I mean, is that -- you've taken down your outlooks a couple of times. Can you speak just a little bit about -- are you fairly comfortable with the U.S.?  Do you feel that maybe there might be another round that's needed, given the environment or how you're thinking about the risks as we look toward 2013?","Paul E. Huck","Our business within the U.S. is solid. Our margins are good. Our -- and as we look at the growth prospects, we're there and we feel good about that. So I would not see us trying to take any action within the U.S.","Operator","Our last question comes from John Roberts with Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I think you said that adding in Mexico alone would have increased your North American volumes by 3%. Was that with 100% of Mexico or just your proportional share? And could you tell us what Mexico is up year-over-year and what the oil and gas component of that was, because that seemed like that drove it?","Simon R. Moore","Yes, John. So just to be clear, what we said, our LOX\/LIN volumes would've been up 3%, and that assumes 100% of Mexico. The oilfield services on a year-on-year basis were up pretty significantly. I think it was in the range of 20% to 30%. And, again, most of that was driven by the liquid nitrogen for oilfield services.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Simon R. Moore","Okay. Thanks, Lea. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. Thank you for joining us, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products' First Quarter Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Scott Crocco, our CFO. John will make a few opening remarks, Scott will review our results and update our outlook, and I will provide a perspective on each of our operating segments.

McGlade","Thank you, Simon, and let me also wish everyone a good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today.","Please turn to Slide 3. We delivered on our commitments during the first quarter of fiscal year '14. We continued to execute on our strong backlog, including bringing onstream 2 new projects in China; execute on our asset loading plans, with strong volume growth in Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials; deliver on our cost reduction programs. We are on track and seeing the savings from the program we announced last quarter and we remain focused on winning profitable new projects. Together, these factors enabled us to deliver the Q1 earnings results you see today, which are at the top of our guidance range. Our focus has not changed, and we remain committed to delivering on our priorities for 2014. The investments we have made over the past several years, the position of our portfolio and our ability to execute going forward are key drivers for Air Products' future. We believe shareholders will realize increasingly stronger returns as earnings growth from the profitable projects in our backlog contribute in 2014 and accelerate in 2015 and 2016.","Now let me turn over the call to Scott to review our results.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 4, let me now take you through our fiscal Q1 results. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were flat excluding the PUI business. Overall, sales were 1% lower than prior year on slightly lower volumes and stable pricing, partially offset by higher energy passthrough. Volumes were higher in all segments except for Tonnage Gases.","Last quarter, we told you that a significant number of our customers would have scheduled outages in 2014. The reduced volume you see in Tonnage is largely a result of this and was expected. Sequentially, overall sales decreased 2% on 3% weaker volumes. This was mainly due to seasonality in our Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials businesses and the outages in Tonnage.","Operating income of $386 million increased 4% versus prior year on strong results in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment and Energy business segments. Our operating margin of 15.1% was up 60 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to a more favorable business mix as higher volumes across most businesses were partially offset by Tonnage outages. Sequentially, operating income was down 8% and margin declined 120 basis points, primarily due to volume seasonality and higher costs driven by Tonnage maintenance outages.","Net income and diluted earnings per share were up 4% and 3%, respectively, versus last year. Sequentially, net income and EPS were both down 9%.","Our return on capital employed declined by 130 basis points to 9.9% as a result of our higher capital employed and the Indura acquisition. This remains well above our 8% cost of capital. As a reminder, we are developing, executing and operating good projects that will be accretive to ROCE over the next few years.","Turning to Slide 5, you can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.34 increased by $0.04 versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.12, driven by Merchant Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment. The positive impact on profits was partially driven by mix, primarily the positive impact of more higher-margin sales of equipment business. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.05, due primarily to higher variable cost in Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials. Net cost performance was $0.01 unfavorable, primarily due to tonnage maintenance outages offsetting the benefit of our 2012 and 2013 cost reduction programs.","Currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.01 unfavorable. Equity affiliate income was also $0.01 unfavorable. And lower interest expense was offset by higher shares outstanding.","Overall, we delivered a good quarter, with earnings at the top end of our guidance range, based on strong execution and a more profitable business mix.","Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 6. Overall, the Merchant Gases segment had a strong quarter with stable pricing and strong volume growth resulting in increased utilization rates in both U.S., Canada and Europe. Merchant Gases sales of over $1 billion were up 4% versus last year on 4% higher volumes. Liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes were again up in all regions, partially offset by packaged gas demand weakness in Europe and lower helium volumes globally due to supply challenges.","Sales were down 1% sequentially on lower volumes, primarily due to weaker seasonal volumes in U.S.\/Canada and lower helium availability.","We continue to see challenges with reduced availability from our helium feedstock suppliers. In one case, the large supplier moved an outage into Q1, negatively impacting available volumes during this past quarter. But this won't impact overall FY '14 availability as the unplanned outage was used to address maintenance that had been planned for later in the fiscal year.","Let me now spend a minute updating you on how our helium projects are progressing and what we are doing to help improve the situation. Our Wyoming plant is ready. Our supplier's plant has been in operation and so we expect to receive our crude helium feedstock very soon, which will enable us to begin to provide product to the market as we move through the quarter.","The Colorado facility we announced last quarter is on schedule for FY '15 startup. And we have worked with another of our existing U.S. suppliers to expand our natural gas pipeline collection system to increase available helium molecules. We expect to see this increase next quarter.","With this new capacity, we are optimistic we will see increased helium supply volumes over the next year. But it is important to remember that the U.S. government supply, about a third of the world's helium supply today, is declining each year as the reserves are depleted. To frame this, our new Wyoming plant, when fully ramped, will offset about 1 year of decline in Air Products share of available helium from the U.S. government.","In the Liquid Bulk area, contract signings were very strong, up significantly over last year, with Asia and U.S.\/Canada showing the most growth. We are seeing the positive impact of last year's strong contract signings on our current volumes and are pleased about future growth from the more recent signings.","Merchant Gases operating income of $169 million was down 1% versus prior year and down 4% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.1% was down 80 basis points compared to last year and down 60 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, the higher volumes improved operating income, but this was more than offset by the impact of price versus variable costs, primarily power and fuel. Overall, pricing was flat, but this includes a positive price contribution from helium. LOX\/LIN pricing was not able to fully recover increased variable costs.","Sequentially, operating income was down primarily on the lower volumes, and margins were impacted by the under recovery of increased variable costs.","Now let's take a look at the Merchant business by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In U.S.\/Canada, sales were up 4% on 2% higher volumes and 2% higher pricing. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes were up 4% on strength in the Oilfield Services, chemicals, food and metals markets. We saw a positive volume contribution from the EPCO acquisition, but helium volumes were down due to supply limitations. After 3 quarters of solid LOX\/LIN volume growth, we have seen capacity utilization move up to the upper 70s. There's still capacity to sell in our system, but it's great to see the increased loadings. Overall, pricing was positive from both helium and LOX\/LIN, but we did not fully recover higher LOX\/LIN variable costs.","We announced 2 new production facilities for our North America CO2 business in Wisconsin and Iowa, strengthening our position in the Midwest to support growth at existing and new customers. We are pleased with the EPCO acquisition, both in terms of the base CO2 business and the opportunities to provide a full product solution to customers who need CO2 and other gases.","In Europe, sales were up 3% versus last year due to currency, as both volumes and prices were flat. We did see positive LOX\/LIN and LAR volumes, but this was offset by lower helium and lower cylinder volumes. LOX\/LIN volume growth was strong in Central Europe and Southern Europe, recognizing the growth is from the weak base last year. Cylinder volumes were down across the continent as construction remains weak. Overall pricing was flat, with positive helium pricing offsetting negative LOX\/LIN and LAR pricing. While LOX\/LIN variable costs were flat, the lower pricing did impact margins. And LOX\/LIN plant loadings have increased to the high 70s on the stronger volumes.","In Asia, sales were up 6% versus last year on 8% higher volumes and 2% lower price. LOX\/LIN volumes were again up double digits across the whole region and in China. Liquid argon volumes and our micro bulk product line continue to show significant improvements while helium was down on supply limitations. Plant loadings remain in the mid-70s with capacity additions roughly matching the volume increase. Pricing was down in the LOX\/LIN and LAR business, particularly in China, driven in part by the wholesale market. The lower prices and higher variable costs impacted margins.","The Latin America results in the segment include our wholly-owned business in Brazil and our majority-owned business Indura. While our equity affiliate joint venture in Mexico is not in the segment results, our Mexico business did see strong LOX\/LIN volume growth of mid to high single digits, primarily driven by nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery.","Underlying sales were up 2% on 1% higher volumes and 1% higher prices, and there was a negative 7% impact from currency. Brazil LOX\/LIN volumes were up as our new liquid plant in S\u00e3o Paulo enhances our ability to serve customers despite economic weakness. Cylinder volumes were down as we looked to optimize our customer mix. Indura volumes were up slightly, with modest economic growth moderated by delays in new mining and power projects in Chile and economic weakness in Colombia and Argentina. We were pleased to sign a new small on-site nitrogen plant, likely an opportunity that neither Indura nor Air Products could have won alone. LOX\/LIN plant capacity utilization is in the mid-70s. And overall pricing was stable, with strength in helium and weakness in LOX\/LIN under recovering variable costs including inflationary pressures.","Please turn to Slide 8. As Scott mentioned and as we expected, the Tonnage Gases segment was impacted by higher level of outages. We take the opportunity to do maintenance work on our plants during our customers planned outages, and this impacts both maintenance costs and sales. Tonnage Gases sales of $808 million were down 10% versus last year. Gases volumes were down 10% as strong demand on the U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen system continued but was more than offset by planned outages and lower Latin America volumes.","Lower PUI volumes impacted sales by 3% while higher energy passthrough added 2% and currency added 1%. We have now fully exited the PUI business as of the end of Q1. For Q1, PUI sales were down about $30 million and operating income was about flat versus last year. PUI will be a negative year-on-year comparison for the rest of FY '14 as we had positive earnings from PUI in FY '13. For the full year, we still expect PUI sales down about $140 million and about a $0.10 negative EPS impact.","For the segment, sequential sales were down 3% on 4% lower volumes due to the outages, partially offset by 1% from currency. Operating income of $118 million was down 15% versus prior year and down 13% sequentially, primarily due to maintenance costs and lower volumes associated with these outages.","Operating margin of 14.6% was down 80 basis points versus prior year on 150 basis points on the lower operating income.","During the quarter, we brought the XLX project onstream in China and bidding activity remains strong. We would not be surprised if we had additional project announcement soon.","Please turn to Slide 9. We'd strong performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment this quarter with solid volume growth and positive contribution from our cost actions. Segment sales of $579 million were up 5% versus last year on 6% higher volumes and 1% lower price. Sequentially, sales were flat, with currency offsetting lower volumes.","Versus prior year, Electronics sales were up 4%, primarily driven by higher equipment and on-site sales while growth in our ongoing Materials business offset the impact of product exits. Electronics sales were up 3% sequentially on higher equipment activity. Performance Materials sales were up 8% versus last year as we saw positive growth across all product lines in all major regions. Autos, coatings and North America residential housing were strong while nonresidential construction continued to be weak.","Sequentially, PMD sales were down 4%, which is less than the typical seasonal reduction. Operating income of $84 million was up 36% versus prior year on the higher volumes and solid cost performance. We are on track in delivering on our business restructuring and cost reduction programs.","Compared to last year, we had good news from a specific equipment sale that was roughly offset with a negative impact from inventory revaluation. Operating margin was up 320 basis points to 14.4% on a higher operating income. Sequentially, operating income was down 13% and operating margin was down 210 basis points, primarily due to inventory revaluation.","The first portion of our supply to Samsung in Xi'an, China came onstream during the quarter. We announced this project in 2012 and will continue to bring on additional facets throughout the rest of FY '14 to support the ramp up of Samsung Electronics' largest ever overseas investment.","Now please turn to Slide 10. Equipment and Energy segment delivered strong profits this quarter as project activity remained robust. Sales of $111 million were up 4% versus prior year and down 6% sequentially. Operating income of $21 million was up 144% over a slow prior-year quarter and flat sequentially. Versus last year, more higher margin LNG projects and less lower margin ASU activity drove the profit increase.","The backlog of $343 million is down 12% from last year and down 15% versus last quarter. In general, we continue to see a high level of project development activity, but a few projects have delayed their final decisions.","However, just last week, we were pleased to announce an order to supply our leading technology and equipment to Technip and JGC to build Russia's largest LNG production and export facility. We will supply 3 exchangers supporting the overall 16.5 million tonne per year project on the Yamal Peninsula. And earlier in January, we dedicated our new LNG manufacturing facility in Florida that will enable us to support strong LNG market growth for many years to come.","As we said last quarter, our Tees Valley energy-from-waste projects are on budget, on schedule and meeting our safety goals. We expect Tees Valley 1 to begin commissioning in late FY '14 and be fully onstream in early FY '15. Tees Valley 2 is expected to start up in early 2016.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott.","M. Scott Crocco","Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 11, and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. Economic activity in the first quarter of 2014 was about as we expected in most regions. Given current economic conditions, we continue to be cautious with regard to economic growth in 2014, expecting modest growth throughout the year. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we are maintaining a manufacturing growth forecast of 2% to 4% for our fiscal year.","In the U.S., while some policy uncertainty is reduced, important issues remain, including a congressional debt ceiling debate and potential changes to the speed of tapering and interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve. Any mistakes in fiscal or monetary policy could dampen growth.","In Europe, weak growth conditions remain due to the continuation of austerity programs, restricted access to credit and high unemployment. While there is positive manufacturing growth in most European countries, we expect improvement to be moderate.","In Asia, manufacturing growth in China and Japan has stabilized since recovering from a trough in the second half of FY '13. Other Asian markets, including Korea and Taiwan, continued underperforming. We expect a gradual acceleration of manufacturing growth to continue, led by China.","In South America, manufacturing activity has been below expectations. As the larger markets of the global economy improve, especially China, we expect modest but improving conditions through increasing global trade.","We expect electronics growth will begin to rebound in 2014 after 2 years of weakness. However, electronics on-site bidding activity remains slow. Outside electronics, our project development activity and contract signings continue to be strong, and we would not be surprised if we had new project announcements soon.","Our FY '14 capital spending guidance remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion, similar to last year's CapEx spending level.","Also, our backlog for the quarter remain unchanged at approximately $3.5 billion. You can see an updated list of our major projects in the Appendix, Slide 14.","We are maintaining our EPS guidance range of $5.70 to $5.90 per share for the year. Our guidance for Q2 is for earnings per share of $1.32 to $1.37, based on the following factors: on the positive side, volume improvement in both Merchant and Performance Materials. We expect to see higher volumes in North America and Europe, partially offset by some softness in volumes in Asia due to the Lunar New Year and in South America due to the summer vacation season. No inventory revaluation and further progress on our cost reduction initiatives.","Offsetting this sequential improvement in Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to higher maintenance spending as more of our refining customers begin taking their annual outages. Another sequential headwind impacting our Tonnage results will be our exit from the PUI business. And in Equipment and Energy, we expect lower profits in the second quarter based on project timing.","Now let me turn the call back to John to wrap up.","John E. McGlade","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 12. In conclusion, our performance this quarter was driven by our ability to execute effectively on the strategic priorities we set out at the beginning of this year. We continue to stay focused on executing against our backlog, winning profitable new projects, loading our existing assets and driving productivity and cost improvements.","Let me now take a moment to briefly update you on our progress in the search for the next CEO. As you know, the board has retained an executive search firm and is looking at candidates who have the right skills and experience to take our company forward. I can't give much more insight than that, but I want you to know that the process is well underway and the board and I are confident that we will find the right leader for Air Products.","Finally, as I said at our annual shareholder meeting last week, having spent 38 years with Air Products, I can say with the utmost confidence that while individuals may come and go, the values that drive our organization remain deeply rooted. These values define who we are and distinguish us from other organizations. I cannot speak highly enough to the employees at our company and I am immensely proud to be a part of this great group of people.","With that, thank you. And now we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. First, can you help a little bit as you think about the next quarter bridge on a year-over-year basis, how much of a headwind you have on PUI and how much of a tailwind from cost productivity that you've achieved? And secondly, on the sort of customer negotiations, are you seeing sort of any sort of pushback on projected project timing as customers reevaluate project costs? Or can you give us some sense of how that is being balanced currently?","M. Scott Crocco","Sure, Laurence. This is Scott. So first the question regarding the PUI. We look forward to next quarter. I think if I got your question right, looking at Q2 versus prior year, what do we think the headwind would be for PUI? I would put that at about $0.03 or so. I think that's also in line with what we would expect to see from the cost saving actions, both for the provision that we took here in the last quarter as well as the full year impact that we saw from the provision back in 2012. And just a comment on that, I just want to reemphasize that we are on budget and on track to deliver the benefits from those provisions. The second question I think you had was in terms of the customer negotiation. Let me just make a quick comment and I'll turn it over to John. I think from a -- first of all, in terms of projects, they're underway. There's been no project stoppage. Big projects sometimes get delayed, but there's no shutdown or anything like that. Maybe I'll turn it over to John for additional comments.","John E. McGlade","Sure, Laurence. It's John McGlade. Yes, on -- in the current bidding activity, these are large projects, large projects that the front end take some time to work their way through feed typically. Bottom line though is when we look at our CapEx forecast for this year and when we look at the bidding activity as we go out, I don't think there's anything abnormal in the context of what we've seen in prior years.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Don Carson.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Question on Merchant. You had an uptick in operating rates. And I guess the question is, you'd talked in the past of 35% incremental margins on Merchant. So why wouldn't that additional business have helped you more than offset some of the increases in variable costs and lead to a margin improvement there?","M. Scott Crocco","Right. So, Don, this is Scott. So absolutely, when we look at the incremental loading impact, we'd still put it at 35% incremental margin or so. It's just a matter of the timing from the raw material increases, principally from power and fuel. We recognize -- we're trying to work the pricing environment as always, balancing it with volume. Sometimes, there's a lag when we see the cost step up from the time when we take the pricing action. But we've seen the capacity utilization increase and we're getting those incremental margins we expected.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then on the project backlog. You had 2 projects come off, startups in China. So can you quantify in dollar terms where the backlog -- where you started the quarter and where you ended the quarter, and how you expect that to unfold as the year progresses?","M. Scott Crocco","So I would say there's always going to be lumpiness as things come on and come off. And so we're trying to look at this on a total basis. We would expect it to be bouncing around a little bit, but roughly I would say 3.5 or so, maybe down a little bit just on the timing of when these things come onstream.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, you -- all of your earnings growth this year is back-end loaded. So what changes in the second half of the year? Is it acceleration in contribution from your productivity programs? Is it project startups? What -- if you can just go through some of those dynamics?","M. Scott Crocco","Sure. So let's think about it. Again, this is Scott. And let's think about it in terms of the things we've been talking about: loading the assets, bringing the projects on, and delivering on our productivity. So from an asset loading perspective, we continue to maintain our outlook from the economy, coupled with good signings that we've had. And so the combination of those 2 will see the asset loading continue. We continue to work to bring the projects on in the backlog. And as we said in the past, there'll be bigger impact in the back half of the year. And we're executing to the cost reduction program that we announced last quarter. So all of those things combined will translate into a robust second half of the year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, I'm just curious if you might give us some sense, maybe on a bigger picture question. Curious if you think the gases demand to GDP multiplier, could you tell me how it compares around the world and how you particularly see it changing, if any, in Asia?","John E. McGlade","So yes. Typically, you know that the demand, the GDP, we actually like to track it closer to the sort of an industrial output or manufacturing type of number. Varies almost on an S-curve as a function of the maturity of the particular geography you're talking about. Having said that, there have been -- and that typically is 1 to 2, somewhere in that -- in a very sort of middle part of the S-curve, it could be a little higher than 2. What's changed that, I think, to the positive in terms of demand for all gases if you want to speak to within that context, is the phenomena that's happened in hydrogen and the phenomena that's happened in gasification in particular in China in driving hydrogen for refining globally, if you will, as clean fuel standards translate around the globe and then oxygen specifically for gasification in China. So I think that those rules of thumb are good over a long period of time in any given year, obviously given in particular my comments around these larger tonnage type of volumes. As Scott used the word, they could be a little lumpy based on the timing on when those projects come in to the P&L. But if you think about, one last point, if you think about what ultimately drives the demand for industrial gases and try to sort of track that towards the macro trends in the world, I firmly and strongly believe the drive for energy efficiency, the drive for increased throughput or productivity in the manufacturing process, the drive for an improving quality of end products, whatever they may be and sort of the over arching environmental regulations and policies bode well for this type -- this industry as we go into the future.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I might ask a quick follow-up, can you discuss what the philosophy or basis for the -- those recent retention agreements were?","John E. McGlade","Sure. I mean, to me, they're normal course of business. We look at that all the time. And what we wanted to do was not tie any new CEO's hands, but really ensure that we have a smooth transition with the next management team here.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","The improvement in electronics you noted, are you seeing that now and -- or is that going to be a little bit more maybe June, September driven?","John E. McGlade","I'm sorry. I missed the second part.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is it going to be more second half loaded in terms of the improvement there, or are you seeing the improvement in electronics now?","M. Scott Crocco","So some of the improvement that we've seen in electronics is driven by our delivery systems. And we also typically see a seasonal first half being a little bit weaker, second half being a little bit stronger. But I think we've focused our portfolio on the right products, materials and -- process materials and advanced materials. And in addition to the focus on volume growth, we're also taking the cost actions to get our portfolio where it needs to be long term.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, John, I think you've mentioned that signings of new projects continue to be pretty healthy here. Are the returns still pretty good in those areas? And then, when you think about the second half of the year, can you give us a feel for how much of those projects coming onstream will contribute?","John E. McGlade","Sure. First, on -- I think, Mike, you know, you can never fall in love with an on-site project because you're locking in the return on the day that you sign that project. And so we've been through in many of these other calls. We got a fairly robust process to decide how we're going to price a particular project. And if we can achieve the returns that we want from that project, we're going to walk from it. And that is at least how I view tonnage projects. And I'm very comfortable that the quality of the returns of the projects that we've been signing over the last number of years that are both in the backlog and the new bidding activities meet that criteria. At the beginning of the year, and Scott may want to add a little more comment to this, at the beginning of the year, we didn't really lay out quarter by quarter the impact of new projects. But I believe we said, it'd be $0.20 to $0.25 in earnings this year. And as we noted in this release, we started up 2 smaller of those projects. Scott, you might want to add a couple more comments.","M. Scott Crocco","Right, sure. So as John mentioned, I think I mentioned earlier, the second half is going to be a bigger impact from new projects coming onstream. Here in the first quarter, maybe we saw a few cents. However, we expect that to increase sequentially going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My question is on Tonnage. If I look back to the mid-2009 period, Tonnage was down 6% or 7%. And given the fact that it's down 10% in volume this quarter and based on your EPS walk on Slide 11, might be implying it gets worse from here. I'm just trying to get my head around why that would be given the current situation. It seems that, that decline is pretty severe for just some customer shutdowns.","M. Scott Crocco","So, David, this is Scott. So first of all, I just want to make sure as you're looking at it that you recognize there's the PUI divestiture.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right.","M. Scott Crocco","And then once you adjust for that, I mean, the big impact has been the outages of our customers, and then we take our maintenance when they go down. And then going forward, we would actually expect to see a little bit of a step up in the second quarter as well from outages. And they had, as I think I mentioned in the call last quarter, we had a contract termination in Latin America as well. All those things contributing to volumes being down. That said, we are well positioned to grow in this part of the portfolio going forward.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up. On Merchant volumes in Europe, it seems like eurozone industrial production just started picking up maybe November, I don't want to say that one point makes a trend. But as you're looking at that, the outlook for Merchant gas volumes in Europe in 2014, are you more encouraged given the economic data that you're seeing lately?","M. Scott Crocco","There's always things that are bumping around in terms of headliners and so forth. I think as we said at the beginning of the fiscal year guidance was kind of manufacturing output for the eurozone to be in the 0 to 2%. And seeing sequential improvement, adjusting for seasonalities as we go forward, I think we've seen that, recognizing there's ebbs and flows and there's different strengths and weaknesses across the geographies. As well as acknowledging that from a LOX\/LIN perspective, we've seen an increase, recognizing that we've seen more softness from the cylinder side as well, driven by construction.","Operator","We'll take our next question from James Sheehan with SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could comment on the Merchant Gases business a little bit. I think you referenced some wins that you had versus the prior year. Just what is the tone of your net of what you're seeing overall wins versus losses and what's the trend there?","M. Scott Crocco","Right. So this is Scott again, Jim. It's a good question. When we look across the portfolio, each of the different regions in the Merchant business, we've got solid signings, well up year-on-year. Team's done a very good job. If we all look at the different elements of the volume growth, and I'll take some broad brushes, largely applies to each of the different regions. We've seen the base volume growth in line with the economic environment that we're operating in. We've seen the impact from these signings. As we recall, we've seen improved signings now for some time and we're seen those volumes come onstream. And as we look at in a loss business, lost for any reason, including spot or seasonal activity, that's been in line with historical trends. And so overall, we feel good about the volumes that we've been able to deliver and we're focused on continuing to deliver profitable growth going forward.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And just on LOX\/LIN pricing, it's not moving up yet. I'm just wondering what level of utilization you think needs to be achieved before you get some leverage on price.","M. Scott Crocco","Well, so -- and you saw I think we moved up both to the high 70s in both U.S., Canada and Europe. Recognize, these businesses are very, very local. We're looking in managing the situation in each of those different sub-geographies, and making sure we're striking a balance between price and volume and focus on long-term profitable growth going forward. So as those utilizations move up into the 80s, that will improve the pricing environment. Again, recognizing that this is a very, very local business and we're managing appropriately based off of all the sub-geographies.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Scott and John, you mentioned the strong signings in Merchant. Are you gaining share do you think in merchant and if so from whom?","John E. McGlade","I don't think we're necessarily gaining share. I'd take you back to Scott's point, which is you really have to look at the sub-geographies to understand the specific loading in those particular areas. What we are doing though is getting the benefit from or the benefits from added commercial resources in the marketplace. So broader coverage and a stronger focus on applications in those geographies where we have product to sell. And so we've talked about this in the past. But over the last 18 months or so, we really have added in the U.S. market and target areas in Asia both sales and technology resources to really drive additions to unloaded assets.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Fair enough. And, John, just on the benefit from new plant startups $0.20, $0.25 this year. What will be for next year, given the high number of plant startups in the back half of this year?","John E. McGlade","So as I said in the script and I'm not sure we're giving you guidance to that at this point, but you can expect a lot more than that in both of those years as the full benefit of this backlog really starts hitting in '15 and '16.","Operator","We'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citibank.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My the first question on Merchants. You mentioned you're building 2 new CO2 plants. What kind of return on investment do you expect from these 2 plants?","John E. McGlade","Again, we don't typically disclose specific project returns, but these projects fit right into the core of the strategy for acquiring the EPCO facility to give us broader market coverage and broader -- and better distribution supply chain advantages. And as Simon commented in our script, we're very pleased with how the EPCO acquisition has started up both in terms of EPCO performing at its own businesses is exceeding expectations, but also the complementary nature of having CO2 for the food businesses and having a CO2 offering for Oilfield Services has really further helped in the terms of this business and the Merchant business.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on on-site, you talked about weaker tonnage business spend in Latin America. I'm wondering if you can talk about that in any particular end market where you're seeing that weakness.","M. Scott Crocco","No, obviously, this is really -- this is Scott. We had mentioned in the call last quarter that we had contract terminations. So that's where we're seeing impact to volumes there.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So that's all there is, it's all from the contract terminations?","M. Scott Crocco","Right. That's correct.","John E. McGlade","Correct.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, you talked about increasing the geographic density of your assets. As the portfolio evolves, what can you comment on your asset density and how you can increase it?","John E. McGlade","So -- I mean, any good industrial gas business looks to continue to increase your density around a given set of assets. You have to have both the market opportunity to do that and that market opportunity means what are the other asset of competitors in that area and their particular applications. We're looking at that at a very local level, so Scott used the subregion area. But we're looking, if you will, at every concentration within a tight geography of a couple of hundred miles as to where can we enhance our position. So those CO2 assets that we were talking about are examples. Or building out a micro-bulk offering in China or in Korea or in North America are other examples of it. So sometimes you're looking at adding a LOX\/LIN\/LAR plant as we do in the Oilfield Services area. Sometimes you're looking at adding a complementary product line. Frankly, sometimes you're looking at adding those resources I talked from a technology sales point. Each and everyone varies greatly by the dynamics of the market and your position in that market at a very local level. And that's what the team is constantly looking at and doing.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to follow-up on Tonnage volumes. As the outages come back on line and you anniversaried the contract expiration, would you expect volumes to turn positive in that segment by the end of the fiscal year?","John E. McGlade","So when we look at the outage profile here going through the year, we'd expect the second quarter to increase as folks take additional outages. And then in the back half of the year, we'd expect to see volumes increase, especially during the summer season, which is traditionally the high operating level for the industry.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then second question is for Scott on foreign exchange. We've seen a lot of volatility in the U.S. dollar versus emerging market currencies in particular. Wondering if you have made any changes in your assumptions in that regard in terms of your $5.70 to $5.90 EPS range for the year or whether there are other factors offsetting, how are you thinking about the dollar?","M. Scott Crocco","Yes. So obviously we're not in the business -- I'm not in the business of forecasting currencies. We're certainly not in the business of speculating on them. As we saw in our results this quarter, we saw the euro strengthening. We saw weaknesses in the Chilean peso, the Brazilian real, and I don't know where that's going to move going forward. Frankly, we're talking about just translation. And so it's going to be what it's going to be. What we are focused on is making sure in each of those different market, those local market that we understand the current business environment and we're driving profitable improvement.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, if I may. Can you comment on helium pricing and, I guess more broadly, as you increase your available supply over the next, say, 1 to 2 years, how should we be thinking about the translation into your earnings stream?","John E. McGlade","Simon?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. Thanks, Kevin. I think just first of all was we talked helium prices have been increasing over the last few years while volumes have been declining. The team's done a tremendous job of, quite frankly, there hasn't been a factor we've talked about at the earnings line, it has impacted topline volumes. So as we look to the future and we're optimistic we'll see some increased volumes. I think the rate of the helium price increase probably moderates. But I think that will continue to be relatively neutral at the profit line going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of questions. First on the down 10% volume in Tonnage x PUI, how much of that was outages and how much of that was the contract rolling over?","M. Scott Crocco","The biggest impact -- Duffy, this is Scott. The biggest impact was the outages, with the smaller impact being the contract termination.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, so this was an extraordinarily large turnaround season for your customers, is that the way to think about it?","M. Scott Crocco","I think if we look back at the last few years, last several years, just the timing of when customers are taking the outage, this year's a little bit above average. And again as I mentioned before, we saw outages this quarter, we'd expect to see a little bit of a step up in the number of outages in the impact next quarter and then trailing off in both Q3 and Q4.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But then year-over-year into next year, that should be a nice tailwind, maybe 5% to 6%. So we should think about maybe the base to grow from next year was $100 million or $850 million as opposed to the $808 million because of the onetime large turnaround season?","M. Scott Crocco","Yes. I mean, there's always different turnarounds. But I think at this point in time, as we look forward to where our customers are telling us they're going to take outages, we would be at a tailwind next year versus this year. Recognize, too, we've done a nice job growing this business over many decades and so as we get more hydrogen, more hydrogen plants, we're going to have more outages, right, as just we -- as we are bigger in this part of the portfolio.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair enough. And then, if we jump to the Equipment and Energy business, you guys were fairly, I don't want to say negative on the last quarter, but certainly you were guiding down that segment quarter-over-quarter. Seemed to come in a lot stronger. I would think equipment has a decent lead time to it, but why was that, that it ended up being so much stronger than you guys would have expected a quarter ago?","M. Scott Crocco","Duffy, this is Scott again. This is just timing as we work through various projects. And so nothing major, it's just that the processing of the projects that are in backlog.","Simon R. Moore","We still have the same full year outlook for the segment.","M. Scott Crocco","That's right. It's just timing brought forward a little bit.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just the last one on the nice number of signings that you've got recently in Merchant. How should we think about those as far as the effect on pricing? Is it fair to assume that they have a little bit of a negative influence on pricing?","M. Scott Crocco","In general -- so just to be clear, we're always managing the price volume trade-off, right. In general, when we look at new opportunities, the price, depending on the subregions, might be a little lower than average and then you are able to work the price up over time. But let's just be clear. We're making sure that we are managing that combination, we're not dropping price simply to be able to load the facility.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Gulley with BGC Financial.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","I want to dig a little bit deeper with respect to the margin pressure in Merchant, which is your largest business so clearly that's maybe a source of concern. You've talked about the lag effect of formulaic passthrough of input cost. Is that going to persist for a while or should we anticipate a catching up effect where you can get genuine margin improvement because of the incremental leverage you've already addressed?","John E. McGlade","So we need to obviously drive the margin up in Merchant. That's our #1 priority. And that's going to be a combination of loading, as you noted. And as Scott mentioned earlier, as we would see pricing, I'm sorry, loading in the market begin to cross the 80% at a local level, you have an opportunity I think to get more real pricing increases. And frankly, to your point, there is a lag effect. That lag effect is more pronounced when you have a big step function change in those inputs. And over the last several months, I think we could see where natural gas has gone, where diesel has gone and we've got to work that. But the team understands that they've got to work that and we're out doing that day in and day out.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Secondly, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the Tonnage thing. You talked about customer outages particularly, as Scott referenced, the larger pipeline network of hydrogen. Is it possible that as the crudes slate get lighter and sweeter, customers have less need for hydrogen so they might call it an outage, that they've taken a unit down for HDS or whatever but in fact, just because they've changed their crude slate?","John E. McGlade","No, these are -- I appreciate the point, but these are really truly outages that turn around. This is very common part of the year where you go from home heating oils to transportation fuels in calendar quarter 1 and part of calendar quarter 2 as you start for the summer driving season, so to speak. The other point I'd make is on the whole light sweet crude thing, we've looked at that. And we've looked at that so many different ways, and we don't really see a material impact to our business. The other thing that you got to keep in mind is the refineries in the Gulf Coast that can use the heaviest, sturdiest crudes, they're going to tend to run those with a lot of that lighter, sweeter crude predominantly going into those refineries that haven't made the investment to be able to use the more challenged crudes. The other point that I think we got to keep in mind is when refining the amount of power and steam and hydrogen that goes in to refine a barrel of oil in the United States comes from a very advantaged natural gas price versus sort of the rest of the globe where you've got to create that energy and that hydrogen and that theme from $100 a barrel of oil or $90 a barrel of oil. And so there's an implicit invested or capital advantage already, further leveraged by a nice operating cost advantage on the spread between natural gas and oil.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that, John. If I could just wrap up. I know you listen to all your shareholders, but I'm thinking you listen maybe a little bit more carefully to your largest holder. Can you kind of update us on the kind of input you received from that shareholder and how you're kind of thinking about some of the things you've talked about?","John E. McGlade","So you hit the nail on the head. We do listen to the best of our ability to all of our shareholders. And to be quite honest, I would never disclose what one shareholder says to me versus another. I just don't think it'd be appropriate. However, those dialogues with any particular shareholder are all within the context of Reg FD. And each one of them has a little bit different view of how the business should be run, where we should invest, what we shouldn't do. But I think everybody has an aligned view of we need to improve our earnings, we need to improve our returns and I'm totally aligned with that as you've heard in this call and as you've heard from many of our calls and we're very focused on that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So in thinking about your returns for the quarter, they're puzzling in that I think in response to Don's question you said, \"Well, you know our Merchant incremental returns are 35%.\" And so absent the cost inflation you should have been up $13.5 million, but you were down a couple of million. So in Tonnage, you had these difficulties with contract terminations and turnarounds. Is the first half cost structure just tremendously, unusually high and that is the way that you can make your earnings guidance in the second half? Or can you quantify how unusually high the first and second quarter cost structure is?","M. Scott Crocco","Jeff, this is Scott. So maybe -- first of all, I wouldn't call the cost structure unusually high. But if we step back and think about the impact from the Tonnage outages, maybe in broad brush, kind of $0.05 or $0.06 from both the combination of higher maintenance expense that we saw as well as the impact from the volume. So the combination of those 2 are going to reduce the return. And again going forward, we expect to see continued outages and would see a step up from maintenance cost of another $0.03 or so going forward. And again, I'd reemphasize the other things going on in the portfolio, including PUI, which, accounting rules preclude us from putting in discontinued operations. But it's a wind down and, as Simon mentioned, we exited that business in December, but it's going to be a headwind both from a sales and from an earnings perspective. And so I think as we mentioned at the beginning of the year, PUI, I think we said about $0.10 headwind, really driven by the earnings that we saw last year and then having the full year impact in '14. Recognize we did have one quarter's worth of results here in this year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is it looks like you're going to earn $2.70 in the first half and the low point of your guidance is $5.70, so you've got to earn $1.50 a quarter in the second half and going -- up $0.15 a quarter is about $45 million or $43 million in operating income. So how do you do that? How do you get such a big change in the second half?","M. Scott Crocco","So as I mentioned, so we've got the impact from our signings. We recognize the economy is going to be a factor, but what we've seen so far this year is consistent with our original guidance. You couple that economic environment with the signings and bringing those signings onstream. And I think you can see in the Merchant results from the loading perspective. We've seen those impacts. We also then, through the year, we're going to see the impact from the provision actions that we announced last quarter. And again that's broad brush across the Merchant business as well as restructuring actions we're taking inside of the Electronics business, as well as some corporate functions and then focus on bringing onstream the projects that are in backlog, good, profitable projects that when they come on will be accretive to earnings, return on capital, cash flow.","Simon R. Moore","We'll take one more question.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I guess this is just a follow-up. In the last quarter, you gave some very specific bridge guidance from last year to this year. It sounds like you're still expecting the $0.20 to $0.25 from new plants and you're not going to make a call on FX rates, but is everything else the same, principally the base business $0.05 to $0.15 and the cost being plus 15 and any of those other items, has anything changed?","M. Scott Crocco","No, Vincent. This is Scott. No change from the -- for both from the guidance as well as the walk that we gave for you this day.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then quickly, just do you have -- do you know offhand what your ROCE would be x Indura sort of on the same-store sales basis?","M. Scott Crocco","Roughly, the impact from Indura would maybe be 50, 70 basis points, something on that nature.","John E. McGlade","Let me just wrap up by saying our focus on increasing shareholder value remains unwavering and our future prospects are strong given our record project backlog and the significant leverage we have on our existing assets. I, and the whole team, thank you for joining us today. And have a great and safe day. Thank you, Whitney.","Operator","This now concludes the presentation.

Good morning, and welcome to Air Products First Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our Q1 results and outlook for the remainder of 2012. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website.","Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations.","Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Please turn to Slide #3 for a review of our first fiscal quarter of 2012. ","For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 1% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 1% year-on-year on higher prices in our Merchant Gases and performance materials businesses. While overall volumes were flat, volumes were higher from new plants in Tonnage Gases but were offset by lower equipment sales and lower volumes in our performance materials and Merchant Gases businesses. ","Sequentially, sales declined 7% with volumes down 4% due to seasonality in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant Gases segments. Merchant volumes declined more than we expected as we experienced weakness in Asia, including China. Simon will provide the geographic details later. ","Sequentially, lower energy prices reduced sales growth by 1% and currency reduced sales growth by 2%. At the current rates, currency would be a headwind for the remainder of 2012. Operating income of $385 million decreased 5% from prior year due primarily to lower volumes in our equipment and Merchant Gases segments. Higher pricing did not fully recover raw material increases, but productivity offset this impact. Our operating margin declined to 15.9%, down 100 basis points versus prior year and was 60 basis points due to volume and the rest due to under recovery of raw material increases. For the quarter, net income decreased 1% while diluted earnings per share increased by 1% due to share repurchases. Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous or run-rate basis dropped to 12.2%. On an annual basis, return on capital employed is 13%. ","Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. As we announced back in October, we settled the dispute in Spain where the authorities disallowed certain deductions taken by the company's Spanish subsidiaries in fiscal years 2005 to 2011. This $44 million or $0.20 per share charge is excluded from our quarter 1 EPS analysis. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.01. Lower volumes decreased earnings per share by $0.05 year-on-year. Pricing, energy and raw materials, taken together, reduced EPS by $0.02. And costs were $0.02 favorable as our productivity gains more than offset cost inflation. Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together had a $0.02 unfavorable impact. Equity affiliate income was $0.03 higher as the prior year had a charge for a plant sale within one of our Asian affiliates. Excluding the Spanish tax settlement and as we guided to last quarter, our effective tax rate of 23.5% contributed about $0.02. For fiscal year 2012, we still expect the rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. And finally, fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.03. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. ","Merchant Gases' overall sales of $989 million and underlying sales were both unchanged from prior year with positive pricing offset by lower volumes. Sequentially, sales declined 5% due to a 3% unfavorable currency impact and lower volumes partially due to seasonality. Pricing was positive. Merchant Gases' operating income of $192 million was down 4% versus prior year and flat sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.4% was down 90 basis points compared to last year but up 100 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income declined on lower volumes particularly in our European liquid\/bulk and packaged gas businesses. Our cost performance improved significantly this quarter but did not overcome the volume decline. The startup of our new LaPorte ASU this quarter helped alleviate the liquid argon sourcing challenges we had previously experienced. Versus prior quarter, the improved operating and distribution cost performance offset lower volumes and unfavorable currency as operating income was flat. And the 100 basis point improvement in operating margin versus prior quarter resulted from the improved operating and cost performance, more than overcoming the impact of lower volumes.","Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6. ","In U.S.\/Canada, sales improved 2% versus prior year. Volumes were down 1% on weakness in food, medical, electronics and distributors. Helium sourcing challenges continued. We expect our new U.S. helium facility to be onstream late in our second quarter as we are awaiting feedstock from our supplier. Pricing was 3% positive with improvement across the product lines as we took actions to recover higher costs. LOX\/LIN capacity utilization is in the low 70s. Contract signings were below recent high levels but our prospect pipeline remains robust, and we expect strong signings next quarter and through the rest of the year.","In Europe, sales decreased 2% versus last year. Volumes were down 2%, partially due to business we've shed to improve profitability in the region, as well as weakness in the packaged gas market. Pricing was positive in liquid\/bulk and packaged gases but partially offset by continued negative price pressure in Homecare, the business we announced we are divesting. LOX\/LIN plant loadings are in the low 80s, and new contract signings were strong this quarter. ","In Asia, sales were up 2% versus last year, with underlying sales flat, which is a change from the strong growth trend we had been experiencing. Overall, volumes were up 1%. LOX\/LIN volumes were up 2%, excluding conversions as we experienced weaker steel and PV markets notably in China. Packaged gas volumes increased on continued growth of our micro bulk product line, and helium volumes were lower as product availability limited sales. Pricing was down 1% on lower liquid argon pricing due to prior year price premiums in the China spot market. Plant loadings are around 80%. New contract signings were roughly equal to the last few quarters. We expect signings will improve through the year, driven in part by China taking action to stimulate their economy.","This quarter, we continued to win business in key emerging markets. In December, we announced that INOX Air Products, our joint venture in India, will build 2 new air separation units for the growing merchant market in West and South India. One of the units will also supply nitrogen to Posco Maharashtra Steel for their Phase 2 expansion. We will also supply hydrogen to Posco from 2 steam methane reformers. We also signed a contract to provide our integrated oxy-fuel solution to Techpack in Korea. We will install a VSA non-cryogenic oxygen production unit. It will control skid and our clean fire burners to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency and productivity for their glass production.","Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $810 million increased 6% versus last year, with volumes up 6% driven by new plants. Sequentially, sales were down 8%. Volumes were down 2%, and we saw a 4% decline from lower energy pass-through. Operating income of $111 million declined 4% versus prior year as higher maintenance costs more than offset the contribution from new plants. As expected, operating income declined sequentially due to higher maintenance spending, favorable gases contract modifications in the prior quarter and an unfavorable polyurethane intermediates contract modification this quarter. Operating margin of 13.8% decreased 130 basis points versus prior year and 340 basis points sequentially on the lower operating income. ","During our Investor Conference last year, we shared our view of the significant opportunity in the China market and specifically, large on-site oxygen for coal gasification. We are pleased to have announced another project in this important market segment. Last month, we announced the largest single on-site ASU order ever awarded to supply Shaanxi Future Energy Chemical Company in Yulin, Shaanxi Province, China. This multiple train project will produce 12,000 tons per day of oxygen and large quantities of nitrogen and compressed dry air for Shaanxi's coal to chemical plant.","Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $535 million were up 2% compared to last year on 1% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Sequentially, sales were down 9% on lower seasonal semiconductor volumes and soft demand across the LED, display and solar markets.  Electronics sales were up 4% compared to last year and down 7% sequentially on seasonality and slower market growth as we expected. Electronic materials sales were down slightly versus last year, while tonnage and equipment were higher. Electronics materials pricing was stable. Performance materials sales decreased 1% versus last year, with 4% higher prices and a 1% positive currency effect, mostly offsetting a 6% volume decline. Sequentially, sales were down 11% primarily on volume declines. The softness reflects seasonal slowdowns in key markets, including housing and construction.","Operating income of $78 million was up 13% versus prior year, and the segment operating margin improved 150 basis points to 14.6% on improved cost performance. Sequentially, operating income was down 15%, and the operating margin declined 100 basis points primarily due to lower volumes.","In new projects, we announced the onstream of the world's first on-site electronics gas plant to supply high-purity ammonia for Sanan OptoElectronics' LED production in Anhui Province, China. To support Sanan's expansion plans, we will be building a second high-purity ammonia plant at their site. Bringing in the stability and scale of the on-site business model to electronics gases is a success for both Air Products and Sanan.","Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $89 million were down 21% versus prior year on lower ASU and LNG sales. Sequentially, sales declined 7% on lower LNG sales. Operating income of $7 million was down 64% versus prior year and down 37% sequentially due primarily to lower project activity. Profitability has bottomed in this segment, and while it should remain at approximately this level for the next few quarters, we expect some improvement in our fourth quarter based on anticipated orders. Backlog is up 48% over last year primarily on new ASU orders. Bidding activity remains strong, and we hope to announce several LNG orders shortly.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 10. Before we discuss our outlook, let me make some comments on the sale of our Continental European Homecare business. Earlier this month, we announced that we reached agreement with Linde [ph] to acquire our Homecare business in Spain, Germany, France, Belgium and Portugal subject to regulatory agreement and employee consultation. Both of these processes are underway and on a timeline to close the transaction by the end of March. The deal has conditions to modify the price based upon future business results and receivables collections. Therefore, it is too early for us to give you a reasonable estimate of the gain which we will book.","We have also decided to exit our remaining Homecare businesses. In the second quarter, we will begin accounting for the Homecare business in total as a discontinued operation. As we finalize our restatement, we will provide history for people to update their models.","Also, in quarter 2, we will begin taking cost-reduction actions and plan to record a charge for cost reduction in our second quarter results. The charge will cover reductions needed to remove stranded cost resulting from our exit from the Homecare business. This will involve cost reductions in our corporate, regional and Merchant Gases area as we take actions to remove the cost, which Linde and other potential purchasers will not assume. The charge will also cover cost reduction necessary to appropriately size our European business cost structure in light of the European economic recession.","I know everyone has questions as to the size of the reduction, the cost and the benefits. We will detail that information later once we have everything finalized. For 2012, we expect that the sale of our Homecare business will be modestly dilutive to our earnings per share for continuing operations. We will take actions to remove the stranded costs, buyback shares and pay down debt with the proceeds that should make the transaction neutral to fiscal 2013's earnings per share for continuing operations.","Now let me give you a brief summary of our economic outlook. As we told you last quarter, we expect that the first half of our fiscal year would be slower in the U.S. and Asia, and that Europe would be in a recession. We also expected that the second half of our fiscal year would be much stronger as economic activity picks up in the U.S. and Asia. So far, we have seen that scenario play out, with continued slow growth in the United States and Asia seeing a slowdown, particularly in China as policymakers took actions to control inflation. Europe continued to decline. We expect that these conditions will continue through our second quarter. ","Looking to the second half of our fiscal year, we believe that we should start to see improvements in both the U.S. and Asia. For the U.S., as the election draws closer, the debates have changed to how we can create jobs faster. This should improve both consumer and business confidence, thereby strengthening the recovery. For Asia, we have seen some easing of inflation in China. Going forward, during the second half of the year, we expect policymakers to shift their focus from fighting inflation to increasing growth. Asia will also benefit as the U.S. economy strengthens. For Europe, we expect the second quarter to be the trough. However, recessionary conditions will remain throughout the rest of the year. ","In terms of Air Products, our capital expenditure guidance remains robust and unchanged at $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, up from last year's $1.6 billion. And with one quarter completed, we are keeping our earnings guidance unchanged as well. Our earnings per share full year guidance range remains at $5.90 to $6.30.","Now let's turn to our second quarter outlook. Please turn to Slide 11. Our guidance for quarter 2 is for earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.43 based on the following factors: On the positive side, in Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect higher volumes as the first quarter is typically seasonally lower. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to improve on higher operating bonuses and lower maintenance costs and also, less of an impact from our polyurethane intermediates contracting renegotiation. Higher volumes from new plant onstreams, including our new hydrogen plant in Rotterdam and our new ASU in LaPorte, Texas, will also contribute. Merchant volumes should improve in the U.S.\/Canada as we see the impact of our fiscal 2011 new business signings partially offsetting this sequential improvement. Our effective tax rate for fiscal quarter 2 should come in between 25% to 26%. This will be a $0.03 to $0.05 headwind. We expect the Lunar New Year to negatively impact Asia volumes, and we expect currency to be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind next quarter.","Just to clarify, at this time, the guidance for both the next quarter and the full year include the Homecare business.","Now let me wrap up. Quarter 1 started off our fiscal year as we expected. Our project backlog is strong and now totals just over $2.5 billion, a similar level to last quarter with the addition of new air separation unit projects in China, offsetting the onstream of our hydrogen plant in Rotterdam and our air separation unit in LaPorte, Texas. You can see a list of our major projects on backup Slide #13. Our recent orders, combined with the strong bidding activity, gives us a solid outlook for future growth. As we move forward, our priority remains to deliver the growth, margin improvement and higher returns that will make us the best investment choice in the industry for our shareholders. 2012 will certainly offer its challenges. However, we believe we are well positioned to make the progress we need to make to deliver our 2015 goals. Thank you.","And now I'll turn the call over to Mark to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk about Asian demand generally in that you talked about a flatness in your Asian merchant growth? And in the old days, when China would slow down or Asia would slow down, maybe volume growth used to be mid-single digits and now it seems much slower than that. How do you read it? Or how do you read the differences in your Asian end markets?","Paul E. Huck","Well, if you take a look, Jeff, I think what you have to remember -- I think for us is that we do have an electronics business in Asia, which last year grew from quarter 4 to quarter 1. And so -- and that also included the impact which occurs in the merchant area. This year, electronics did what it normally does from quarter 4 to quarter 1, is it contracted. So that's probably one of the big factors. It's that we were seeing the growth of electronics and we didn't see the same level of seasonality which we normally see for things. On top of that, we have also seen our volumes in China slow. And I mentioned that in my remarks principally because the interest rates have been raised a lot in China to kind of control inflation. We have seen inflation start to ease. So we don't think it's a long-term condition for them to tighten up the money supply. And that should ease sometime late quarter 2, or time is our guess. So probably not right post the Chinese New Year, with timing some time right now, we're forecasting in the March timeframe. Those are the 2 big factors for us as we look at that.","Simon R. Moore","Jeff, also just a reminder too that obviously, we continue to enjoy success in our tonnage volumes. Your question was appropriately more about the merchant with new business and new project onstream there. So we do see some strong activity on our tonnage business in Asia and China as we expected.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then lastly, if -- your depreciation charges were down year-over-year in the quarter. And I think the Praxair numbers, maybe they run sort of up high single digits. Is there something different in your business versus their business which is leading to a more level or down depreciation number for you?","Paul E. Huck","So -- and we have taken a look at that as to why that happens, Jeff, a couple of factors, which we'll go in. First, the currency aspect of things. So as the currency -- as the dollar tends to strengthen, which it did this quarter, it's going to drive the depreciation from our overseas facilities down a little bit with that. So there's -- that does not have an equalization of it. Plus the other thing which we have seen over time is that we have seen some facilities roll off their depreciation. So we have seen that occur. Those facilities are still operating. Obviously, it helped our margins with -- rolling forward. Plus a good portion of our capital spending right now, you can see this in the capital lease element of things. That does not get recorded through the depreciation accounts anymore. And so that's the other factor. Depending upon the -- but the way in which we treat the one-on-one on-sites does not lead to depreciation. So a lot of the large gasification plants are not going to have depreciation associated with them. It's going to have a capital receivable, which gets booked as an asset instead of PP&E and then that flows through.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Paul, your performance materials business continues to underperform the electronics portfolio. Is this really a core business for you given all kinds of opportunities that you have in your industrial gases business?","Paul E. Huck","Well, what you're talking about on the performance materials, P.J., they had a sequential downturn in volumes and a year-on-year downturn on volumes. The profitability and returns in that business are still very good for us. And so as we look at this, we think it is still an excellent business. It is not a business which introduces a lot of ups and downs and cyclicality to Air Products for things. As we look at this, we don't have large swings really in that much in our volumes overall in the business. We continue to see opportunities to get our products formulated in and to make them a steady cash flow for us. So we're happy with the business. We think it's performed very well. And so for right now, the answer is yes.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then if you look at the commentary from semiconductor companies in January, it does materially improve and they're seeing some at the bottom. So when should you begin to see that improvement in your numbers? And what are your expectations for square inches of silicon this year?","Paul E. Huck","So as far as that's concerned, and I'll let Simon chime in here too, what we would expect is really to have a much stronger second half than the first half period. So it's probably a few months' lag on that. Simon, you are close to the business?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. Thanks, P.J. And I mean, we would still say for the year, we expect square inches of silicon to grow in that 0% to 5% range, probably right in the middle of that, which is what we've talked about last quarter. And as you pointed out, I think generally speaking, Intel talked about a stronger second half. TSMC actually talked about having a better first calendar quarter than seasonality would expect. And just one statement that we talked about a few times is our strength with Samsung, Intel and TSMC. They're expected to be almost half of the industry CapEx in 2012. So we continue to benefit from our strong position with them.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just lastly, housekeeping. You had that slide on the project backlog. None of those projects were in Europe. So I was wondering what percent of your project backlog is in Europe.","Paul E. Huck","Yes, it is a small amount, I know, of our capital spending, P.J. I think our capital spending is somewhere about 10% to 15% of our CapEx for growth. Next year is in Europe, I guess 12% or something like that. So it might be 15%, but it's not a huge amount for that right now.","Simon R. Moore","And obviously, we brought on the big hydrogen plant in Rotterdam. We do have the one large oxygen plants in Europe that will come onstream in 2013.","Paul E. Huck","But that shouldn't surprise anyone. And given the European economy right now, when you look at things, they're not adding a lot of industrial capacity.","Operator","And our next question will come from Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","For Paul, I won't be able to ask you anymore when you're going to sell off European healthcare, but I will ask you what you're going to do with polyurethanes. It seems to be a drag on the tonnage business and has very inconsistent results. Is that business making money? And tell us more about this negative contract modification you had. And then one follow-on for merchant. Your U.S. operating rate seems stuck in the low 70s. Is there a need for some capacity rationalization to get that operating rate up?","Paul E. Huck","Okay. First, with regard to polyurethane intermediates, as you know, we said this before, it's not a business in which we're investing in. We don't see the opportunity to extend in the model which we have. So we have some contracts which we are working through at this point in time. The business -- as far as today is concerned, the returns on the business are still very good. Our contracts are still very good, we think. So as far as the drag, yes, it might be a drag on growth. But a drag of the profits, no for us. And we continue to look at our options going forward for that business, but it's not a business which obviously we're going to be investing in. We can extend the model to Asia. And most of the PUI -- and most of the TDI production is moving to Asia, as you know. If you then turn to and take a look at what's happening in the U.S. in merchant, the capacity rates have been low. We would expect that we would start to see improvements in volumes in this quarter based upon -- in the signings which we have seen. Do we think we need to take capacity out? The answer is no. We believe that there are opportunities to sell that capacity. For us, we don't see any place in which we can't imagine us being able to sell that based upon the applications which we have. It was a question of us on the sales force during the Airgas transaction of not pushing as hard, not replacing people and not trying to grow the sales force. We have taken those actions. We've seen an improvement in signings. We would expect signings to improve in the second quarter of 2012 also.","Simon R. Moore","And Don, I think you also may be asked about the PUI customer, maybe just to kind of go back to that. We talked about that last quarter, and we have one specific customer that we described at last quarter we were concerned about their financial viability. The good news is they're still operating. We did end up renegotiating their contract and sequentially, that was about a $0.03 to $0.04 hit in the tonnage segment. That will not be -- the delta for the year will not be 4x that. So there is significant change for this Q1. And the impact for the rest of the year, Q2 through Q4, is probably a little bit less than it was in Q1. Okay?","Paul E. Huck","Probably -- and to clarify that, there's probably about $0.03 of bad news year-on-year still to come from what was our run rate. However, the run rate on a sequential basis is going to improve in that business.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Duffy Fischer with Barclays Capital.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In October, you changed out and installed John in merchant, global merchant, as GM. Can you kind of talk about what we should expect to see differently with him running that business and what you were trying to change by putting a new person in that spot?","Paul E. Huck","Well, I think -- and one of the things, I'd say -- I think we've already talked about it. So we're going to take some actions in Europe to reduce our cost structure in that business. So the focus of the things in which we are trying to improve have been clear from -- for about a year now on that. We're trying to get the volumes up in the United States, and we think we're on the right track to do that. We're trying to get the prices improved in Europe, and we've seen some improvement there. We're trying to get our cost structure improved in Europe, and you'll see some actions coming in the second quarter for that. We're trying to improve the operating performance of the plants, and we've made progress there. You can see that in the cost, in the margins this quarter. And the last thing is improving on the supply of helium. So what we expect is for everyone to execute better.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. You indicated that China slowed down a little bit at least in your merchant business based on kind of the overall slowing that the government was putting in place and that you thought that might be short-lived. What are you seeing on the tonnage side in terms of request for proposals and new projects? Have things slowed down there? Or is that the kind of \"steady as she goes\"?","Paul E. Huck","The answer is yes. We have seen a slowdown in China. It has not affected really on the on-site projects or the equipment projects, which we're chasing there. We still see a good backlog and a lot of bid activity.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up question. A lot of the growth or at least a reasonable amount of the growth in the U.S. over the last decade was largely to -- tied to energy efficiency, where natural gas prices were high, oil prices were high and your customers were looking to be more efficient using things like oxygen. With natural gas kind of in the 250 to, say, 275 range, how should we think about the potential hit to your business there, if there is any, kind of looking forward?","Paul E. Huck","So -- as far as people, it certainly is going to have a damper on people trying to increase the efficiency of natural gas because their benefits are going to be lower. Oil is still relatively high as far as you look at that. And other products are still relatively high, which provide energy, electricity prices, albeit a lot, but they're still at high prices for things, especially due to things like environmental rigs or things. So I think there's is going to be some hit to the opportunities for things going forward. But the other thing is that it's going to open up chances for us to do other things with things, and we're exploiting those opportunities there too.","Simon R. Moore","Well, I think we also believe that low energy prices are very good for the economy, which helps provide general economic growth as well.","Operator","Next is David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is James Sheehan sitting in for David. Just with respect to pricing in Europe, you started to see some improvement there on the liquid\/bulk side and packaged gases. I'm just wondering about your outlook for pricing going forward given the economic headwinds there. And do you -- can you comment a little bit about what you're continuing to see in terms of competitive pricing pressure?","Paul E. Huck","Okay. As far as the pricing in Europe, we expect that -- and that the prices will continue to improve. There is still cost pressures for us with the need to recover our increased power cost, increased cost of diesel in Europe. So we still see that as a driver for us. As far as the competitive pressure, the business has always been competitive. I think we commented on last quarter is that we see our -- we also see our competitors showing a need for price increases also as everyone isn't happy with their margins and their returns in Europe. So we have seen our competitors raise prices also.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then back on performance materials. We're starting to see some initial signs of maybe a perking up of the construction market. What is your outlook on construction? And do you see any material change going forward in 2012?","Paul E. Huck","The outlook for us in construction, I think, is still -- and we're still -- I'm going to say we're not going to be bullish on that yet as far as that is concerned. Our performance materials business though has performed very well and is prepared to respond to that. I would expect the volumes to grow from quarter 1 to quarter 2 and to continue to grow in quarter 3 to quarter 4.","Operator","Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a question.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","With regard to the European Homecare sale to Linde, what is the amount of cash proceeds that you would expect relative to the sale price of EUR 590 million? And what is your expected split of deployment between share repurchases and debt reduction that might be included in your annual earnings guidance, please?","Paul E. Huck","Thanks, Kevin. And so with regard to that, we're going to have to pay taxes on this. Given where we see that today, we think that probably about half of the -- no, excuse me -- if you look at the proceeds, probably about 20% or so is going to wind up going to cash tax payments for us to make, and that will not -- and it isn't the same as booked, obviously, there, because you'll have depreciation in there. And then we will probably come pretty close to half of that being used for share buyback, half of that being used to reduce debt overall.","Simon R. Moore","And just Kevin, I would -- just as a reminder also that we may not see that full level of proceeds as Paul mentioned.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up, you've got remaining assets in Brazil, Argentina, United Kingdom. If I understand you correctly, you're moving all of that into discontinued operations in the fiscal second quarter. Maybe if you comment on what prospect of divestiture looks like there and remind us how large those businesses are in the aggregate.","Paul E. Huck","Yes, and so if you look at the business overall for us, about 80% of the business fits on the continent in what we're selling today. The bulk of the rest of it sits in the U.K. And then the business in Ireland, the business in Brazil and Argentina are all small.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Paul, I know most of your contracts in tonnage and hydrogen allow for pass-through of gas or electricity. Is there -- are there any opportunities there to harvest certainly the release in gas and maybe some help in electricity? And why wouldn't we have seen more pronounced effect on the margin percentage?","Paul E. Huck","So Bob, what you're saying is that on the drop in gas prices, you're expecting to see a bigger increase in margin percentage on the on-site business on the tonnage. So you have seen -- remember that gas prices have been down for a while now. And so we haven't seen a tremendous difference. If I look at my average gas price from quarter 1 of last year to quarter 1 of this year, gas price is probably down maybe about 7% or 8%. It's not down a huge amount for us. So it's been down for a while. And so I think -- and that play has already come through the margin walk for us.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can I ask you about the growth path you've laid out, Paul? At -- in one of the positive attributes of the gas industry, it's more stability and steadiness yet. It looks like the guidance implies something around a 20% or 22% lift in second half versus first half of the fiscal year. Is -- do you think there's a great degree of risk there? Is there a historic precedent that gets you comfortable you can see that kind of elevation in the second half? Or how would you characterize the path this year compared to maybe other periods?","Paul E. Huck","Okay. And so I think what we see happening from an economic standpoint is somewhat the reverse of what we saw at 2011. If you go back to the comments which we made on the economy and what we saw in underlying sales growth in 2011, we saw underlying sales growth come out in the first half of the year, 11% to 12%. In the second half of the year, we saw the underlying sales growth dip to -- I think it was 7% in quarter 3, 4% in quarter 4. So we saw a slowdown and most of that, as we look at it, came from the economic picture because we saw economy started to slow around the world. We saw the U.S. growth rates drop, manufacturing wise. We saw Asia started to come off. We certainly saw electronics started to come off in our fourth quarter, I think. So we saw a number of things. And we saw the European economies and start to go into a recession through the last half of 2011. So what we're -- as we look at this, we think 2012, from a growth standpoint, in the first half of the year, because of the carryover from 2011, it doesn't start with a lot of momentum behind it. And the economic picture in the first half of our fiscal year, we think, is slow. However, as I said in my remarks that the policy in the United States, we ought to be start talking as the election starts to become clear and more things turn towards how jobs are going to be created, that should lift consumer confidence, should lift the confidence of businesses to invest. And so we see people start trying to increase production. In Asia, we think that they -- and they've taken steps to fight inflation. We think those steps probably have had the right impact in China, but we also think that China is going to turn to a more stimulative process -- policy. In Europe, quarter 2 is likely to trough. So sequentially, things ought to start be getting better. We'll still be in a recessionary period and down on the comps year-on-year, but sequentially, we'll start -- we should start to see growth after quarter 2. And so as far as the economy is concerned, we think it's down in the second half. So if you want to say risk, yes, there is risk in our economic scenario. If you take a look at our products, typically, our product seasonally has a better second half than first half. So in this year, the impact of the second-half pickup, which we normally see, is also going to be added on to a better economy. So that's why the growth is much stronger for here. We also see a number of plants coming onstream in the second half. You see that in the backup slide. And we expect a pickup in LNG orders, which we think starts to show in the fourth quarter profits in the -- on the equipment business trying to get better. So those are some of the reasons. There is risk on it. Yes, we have made a call on the future of the economy, but we do think that as our future looks, things are likely to get better.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so Paul, just to conclude there, you would still expect global manufacturing up 2%, 3% or 4%, something like that?","Paul E. Huck","Yes, if you take a look at the economy, then we said we saw global manufacturing up 2% to 5%, we think it's probably coming out close to the middle portion of that range right now for us. The U.S. probably goes -- if the U.S. starts to get better as the fiscal is trying to indicate, it might go to the higher end for the U.S. Europe probably stays to the lower end of our previous forecast.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First, in terms of the equipment business, could you talk about how volume sensitive that business is? And if you got backlog up 40-some percent this quarter, why does profitability not improve until the fourth quarter? And then second question, if you could specifically isolate the impact of higher maintenance cost on the tonnage segment EBIT margin this quarter, that would be great.","Paul E. Huck","And the last one was what? I missed that.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm trying to understand exactly what the impact of just the increased maintenance costs were on the tonnage segment EBIT.","Paul E. Huck","Okay. Yes. I'll handle that. I know it's probably $0.02 to $0.03 a share on the EBIT aspect of things, all right? If you take a look at the equipment business end, the issue here for us is -- on the backlog, is the backlog includes LNG orders. It includes the air separation orders. As we consistently said on the LNG side that the profitably for that business is a lot better because we aren't selling a lot of purchase equipment along with the stuff we manufacture unlike we do in the air separation side. So the LNG backlog is actually down for us. And that's why as we look to the future, we are expecting the LNG backlog to pick back up. And when that happens, the profitability in the equipment business will improve.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I was curious about your comment that you're seeing lower volumes in your U.S. and Canada merchant business, lower volumes to distributors. Given that those distributor customers are typically serving the manufacturing market, which according to all the work we've done suggests things should be pretty strong in the U.S. How do you account for the weakness that you're seeing right now?","Paul E. Huck","And so for us, what we see is that construction markets are still depressed as far as that. And distributor markets tells a lot about construction markets. So we haven't seen a lot of the big pickups in capital spending for us either which -- in the U.S.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then I wanted to ask also about the tonnage business. Historically, that business had been more stable in terms of the quarter-to-quarter operating income in terms of dollars. And here over the last 3 quarters, we've seen a $40 million swing-up last quarter and back down this quarter. Is this a new pattern of volatility that we're going to see kind of contract modifications, swinging one way or the other or maintenance costs being concentrated in one quarter and not in another? Or do you think this pattern we've seen in the last 3 quarters is a little bit more unusual? I'm just kind of trying to get a little bit better sense of any kind of how to model it going forward?","Paul E. Huck","Okay, Mike. And that's, for us, we have taken a look at that. So I'm going to break it into 2 pieces. The contract mods, there is never a pattern to them. We had an unusual mods, which occurred in the last quarter, in quarter 4, which brought a lot of profit for us. That is not going to happen typically in the business. So I would not say that -- that was a one-time event for things. The other thing which we had in this year is we have the mods to -- on the polyurethane customer, which helped him survive a difficult time. For those things that caused us some profit, it's going to cost us a little bit ongoing, but that also was a one-time item. Now if you turn to does the business have a seasonal pattern? The answer to that is yes on the side of hydrogen, unfortunately, and not so much on the oxygen side. But remember, about 2\/3 of the business is hydrogen for us. And so what we see is the bonuses for us peak in quarter -- in our Q4 and the maintenance spending is always the lowest typically in our Q4. And so that's always going to introduce more profit into Q4 for us typically than in the other quarters. So -- but last quarter, we had the impact of the mods, which obviously helped us. They didn't reoccur. The maintenance increased from quarter 4 to quarter 1. So that's why you see the large peak, and then we also -- the large drop. And also, the mods to the polyurethane customer. So quarter 1 was an unusually low quarter, but quarter 4 was an usually high quarter last month. So -- and you're just seeing that. I don't think you're ever going to see swings like that without unusual one-time items happening like, Mike.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And is maintenance spend typically highest in your fiscal fourth quarter then?","Paul E. Huck","No, it's not. It's typically -- if you look at that, it depends upon when the turns are scheduled. It could be anywhere in quarter 1, quarter 2 or Q3, depending upon how much is due at that particular plant at that particular time for us.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then the last question I had was related to the helium capacity that you're bringing on. Has that been delayed? Or can you maybe update us on the timing of that new capacity in Wyoming?","Paul E. Huck","Okay. And the capacity right now is -- and we are waiting for the crude supply to come from our customers. It's being installed, a gas processing facility. We currently expect that to come onstream at the end of quarter 2.","Operator","And our next question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess 2 questions. First, is there any sort of anything unusual on the real estate sale side that will skew free cash flow generation this year?","Paul E. Huck","No.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And secondly, are you seeing any shift in competitor behavior in China that will help sort of make the comparisons easier on the next recovery?","Paul E. Huck","I don't think we're -- as far as China is concerned, the market and the dynamics remain the same. It's a competitive market, and we think we are positioned well and have a good set of products chased in the on-site orders.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And lastly, can you give an update on what you're seeing on your cement market, customers in North America?","Paul E. Huck","Cement customers. I'm going to pass that to Simon, who will probably handle that in an update with you, okay?","Simon R. Moore","Yes. We'll follow up on that, Laurence. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of the operating margin improvement sequentially, first quarter versus the fourth quarter, of merchant, can you give us a little bit more color on the operating performance? Did you cut costs? Were you just running the plants better? And is that 100 basis point improvement somewhat sustainable as we head into the rest of the year?","Paul E. Huck","The answer is yes. It is sustainable. And it didn't come from volume, obviously, as you see that sequentially. And it's by principally -- and the plants going out and running well, we also had, towards the end of the quarter, the argon sourcing improved for us, with the LaPorte being onstream in the U.S. And so that -- and that helped also, of course.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then just on tentative basis when you think about electronics here, your fiscal first quarter was good. You've seen a lot of other companies see further destocking or such in the December quarter. Do you feel better as we head into the fiscal second and third that electronics could even pick up sequentially?","Paul E. Huck","Yes, I think it would. Yes, and we believe electronics is going to pick up sequentially, quarter 1 to quarter 2, and even more so in quarter 3 and quarter 4, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And last question in tonnage, you've got 6% volume growth in the first quarter. Does that number accelerate with the projects coming onstream? Or does that just sort of support that level as the year unfolds?","Paul E. Huck","It should actually get better as the year unfolds for us as far as for this year.","Operator","And our final question will come from Mark Gulley with Ticonderoga Securities.","Mark R. Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division","Getting in under the wire, a few questions on tonnage, actually. One is with respect to -- I want to go back to back -- I'm sorry, financial side, the debt pay down. You said the split between share repurchases and debt pay down will be about 50-50. With interest rates so low, Paul, why would you want to pay down any debt whatsoever?","Paul E. Huck","And the thing which we are going to manage, Mark, is we're going to manage to a debt rating for us. And so as we look at our capital spending and everything like that and our cash flows, we have a Eurobond which is coming due in the beginning of April. And we're going to use the bit of proceeds to pay down the Eurobond for us. And then if capital spending needs go up, we will borrow more, but we're managing toward -- right now to be a debt -- to be A rating.","Mark R. Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my on-site question was this. Given the very low natural gas cost in the U.S., does that affect the economics of refinery of hydrogen enough that stimulates demand? Or is that just a small part of the cost that it's -- it does not really move the needle all that much? I'm talking about customers' economics now.","Paul E. Huck","Yes. And so it is certainly going to help crack spreads for them. It certainly will help if they're going to export products out of the U.S. into other countries for those things. So it does help them in that way, Mark. As far as driving the price of gas down for us overall, it's not going to have a big impact of that, which -- to take gas from $3.50 to $3, it\u2019s not going to do that.","Simon R. Moore","Okay. Thanks, everyone. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2:00 p.m. today.

Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Sandra. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products fourth quarter 2015 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in our company. First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President in charge of Materials Technologies. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions.","A year ago, we promised our investors we would deliver earnings of $6.30 to $6.55 per share in fiscal year 2015. I am very proud to announce that despite weaker than forecasted economic activity and a headwind of more than $0.40 per share due to currency translation, the people of Air Products delivered earning per share of $6.57, which is higher than the top end of our forecast and a 14% improvement versus last year. We owe this excellent performance to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees.","I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to be best industrial gas company in the world.","Now, please turn to slide number 3. We always start our internal and external presentations with a discussion of our safety performance. We are making progress and, as you will note, our lost time injury rate improved by 17% and our recordable injury rate was 16% better than last year.","We believe that excellence in safety performance requires focus, discipline, process orientation and execution. These are the same characteristics that drive excellence in business performance. The improvement in our safety results is encouraging but our ultimate goal remains zero accidents and zero incidents.","Now, please turn to slide number 4. Our goal for the company has not changed. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress in the past year by improving our profit margins by 350 basis points. And we are all committed to work hard to achieve our stated goal.","Now, please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy. Again, no change here. But I would like to reiterate our fundamental management philosophy in our approach to running Air Products. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or our growth rate.","In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most responsibilities as the CEO of the company. Finally, a decentralized organization releases entrepreneurial energy and keeps costs down.","Now, please turn to slide number 6. A year ago, we announced the five-point strategic plan to transform Air Products. I would like to take a few minutes and let you know where we are in the implementation of this plan. The first point of the plan was to get Air Products focused on its core business, our core competency that is Industrial Gases. We have done this and recently announced that we will spin off our Materials Technologies business tax-free to our U.S. shareholders and set it up as a separate stand-alone public company.","Materials Technologies is a great business and our people have significantly improved the performance of this business in the last year. We believe that Materials Technologies as specialty material business will be able to grow and expand and be more profitable as a separate company since its drivers for growth, capital requirement and optimal organizational structure is different from that of our core Industrial Gases business.","So with the separation of Materials Technologies by September of 2016, we will be done with the first point of our plan. The second point of our plan was to recognize that our Industrial Gases business is a local business. We do have a global presence, but we should run the business in a decentralized manner, focused on specific geographies.","Therefore, we embarked on the largest organizational restructuring that Air Products has ever undertaken in its 75-year history. We have created over 40 profit centers and a focused decentralized structure and eliminated the global organizational superstructure that that did not add much value. I am pleased to say that we are done. The new organization structure is in place. The key people are in the proper jobs and the organization is functioning and delivering results as you can see.","The third point of our plan was to change the culture so that we can get everyone focused on safety, simplifying of our work processes, execution with speed and creating the organizational self-confidence that Air Products has the people and the portfolio to be the best in the industry. As you all know, changing the culture in a large company is not an easy task. We have and are making progress but we are not there.","This is an area that we will continuously focus on until we have all of our 20,000 people committed to acting as if they are the CEO of the company and every day each one of them comes to work and looks for ways to improve our business, our business processes, and take actions that are necessary to move us forward with an eye to our safety, simplicity, speed and self-confidence so that we can achieve our goal of being the most profitable industrial gas company in the world.","The fourth point of our plan was the responsible use of cash and controlling our cost. In this area, we have made excellent progress. We have a very robust and agile process for reviewing every capital investment of more than $3 million at the corporate level and we have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects.","In the area of cost savings, we have reduced our overhead costs by $300 million a year already and have a detailed plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational cost savings in the next four years. Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are committed to continue as we move forward so then we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.","The fifth point of our plan was to properly align our incentive reward program. We have totally restructured and changed this plan from what it was before. We now have over 40 profit and loss centers. Their performance is based on EBITDA results and people are rewarded for what they achieve in their specific business unit. This has created differentiation. And for example, in 2015, we have units that will get no incentive award to units that will get 200% of their targeted awards. And our long-term incentive plan is now very focused on total shareholder return.","In summary, we have done what we said we would do. I'm thankful to all of the people of Air Products not only for implementing all of the major changes but, at the same time, staying focused and still delivering an excellent performance for the year while winning new projects.","Now, please turn to slide number 7, our annual results. Scott will take you through the details later, but I want to point out that in 2015, we improved our margins by 360 basis points and we delivered positive free cash flow despite a weak worldwide economy and a $0.40 negative impact from currency exchange translation.","And if you turn to slide number 8 now, which is my favorite slide, you will see our progress in the last seven quarters where we have improved our margins by more than 700 basis points. We are determined to continue to improve our margins until we become the best in the industry.","In slide number 9, we show you our distributed cash flow of more than $10 a share. We believe this measure, more than earnings per share, is the true measure of the wealth we are creating for our shareholders. Up to now, I've been focused on mentioning our efforts on improving our cost structure and delivering the financial targets. But at the same time, we have been very focused on winning projects to ensure future growth.","Please turn to slide number 10. As I mentioned earlier, we announced our intention to spin off Materials Technologies. Also in 2015, we were successful in bringing onstream some of our key large projects in China, such as PCEC, ZY [Zhengyuan] and YK [Yankuang] with over 20,000 per day of additional oxygen capacity onstream. Our customers are running their facilities. They are using the oxygen we produce. And most importantly, we are getting paid.","We were successful and honored to have Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, award us the right to build the world's largest industrial gas complex with an investment of more than $2 billion. Once built, this facility will supply almost 75,000 tons per day of oxygen and nitrogen to Aramco based on a long-term 20-year supply contract.","We have also won a significant contract to build a world scale facility for a major semiconductor company in South Korea and an oxygen supply contract for Big River Steel in the United States. And as we announced on Monday, we are building a world-class hydrogen plant with an investment of around $400 million to supply hydrogen and CO to our pipeline system in Texas.","It's also important to note that we are now celebrating 75th anniversary of being in the business of serving our customers and we look forward to serving them the distinction for the next 75 years.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details of the year and discuss our very strong quarterly results. Then, I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks. And then we will be delighted to answer your questions.","Scott?","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2015 results. Please turn to slide 11. For the year, underlying sales growth increased by 3% with 2% coming from higher volumes driven by Gases-Asia new plant onstreams and Materials Technologies. And 1% coming from higher pricing in Gases-Americas and Materials Technologies.","Operating margin was up 310 basis points to 19% and EBITDA margin was up 360 basis points to 30.1%. This reflects balanced volume, pricing and cost performance. Only 40 basis points of the operating margin increase came from lower energy pass-through.","Now, please turn to slide 12 for some full-year EPS comments. Year-on-year EPS growth of 14% was fairly well distributed across higher volumes, improved pricing and lower costs. Combined, these added about $1.20 per share to our FY 2015 results versus prior year. Key drivers included volume growth in Gases-Asia, Materials Technologies and LNG, price mix improvement in Gases-Americas and Materials Technologies, and better cost performance across all of our segments as our cost actions more than offset incentive comp and inflation headwinds.","This was more than enough to offset unfavorable currency and foreign exchange headwinds of about $0.40. Interest expense was $0.08 lower primarily due to higher capitalized interest. And this more than offset the $0.06 impact of higher shares outstanding.","Now, please turn to slide 13 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 9% versus last year on unfavorable currency of 7% and a lower energy pass-through impact of 3%. Volumes were flat as Gases-Asia growth continued, and our LNG business posted another solid quarter while Materials Technologies and Gases-Americas volumes were down. Corning and Guillermo will comment more on this later.","Pricing was 1% higher for the fourth consecutive quarter and again driven by price increases in Gases-Americas and Gases-Europe, and both price increases and mix in Materials Technologies.","We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA improved by 2% and operating income improved by 9% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 350 basis points to 32.1% while our operating margin improved 340 basis points to 21%. We saw margin improvements across all of our segments.","Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 40 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points resulted primarily from higher prices and lower costs. Better cost performance including lower incentive comp also contributed to our sequential margin improvement.","We continue to improve our performance and this quarter is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. Versus prior year, net income increased 11% and earnings per share grew 10% and we continued to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 140 basis points to 12.4% this quarter.","Now, please turn to slide 14. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow decreased this quarter due to the timing of cash tax payments. However, free cash flow was positive $40 million which is the strongest quarter this year. We remain focused on spending the right amount at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. From a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.","Turning to slide 15, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q4 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.24 per share or $59 million pre-tax. This includes $49 million for position eliminations and pension settlements, and $20 million for asset actions, primarily related to a plant shutdown.","Included in the other income and expense P&L line is a $34 million gain on land sales. This is an example of our very strong focus on optimizing all of our assets including property that was not providing value for Air Products. We also saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $7.5 million for legal and advisory fees.","And finally, we recorded a loss on early debt retirement of $17 million as we redeemed some high-interest rate bonds in Chile. We expect to see restructuring and pension settlement costs continue through next year. We have essentially completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions.","Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in an appendix slide and in the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $1.82 increased $0.16 per share or 10% versus last year despite the significant currency headwinds.","Volumes increased EPS by $0.02 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.12. Net cost performance was $0.16 favorable as higher incentive compensation partially offset the $0.23 benefit from our cost reduction actions. These cost reduction benefits consist of lower personnel costs as well as actions enabled by our new more disciplined organization, including reducing contractors, consultants, travel and other discretionary spending.","Unfavorable currency in FX was $0.16 as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Interest expense was $0.02 lower, due to higher capitalized interest and the remaining items are small and net to zero.","As we mentioned on the Q3 call, we completed the buy-up of the remaining shares of the Indura business in Chile during the fourth quarter. Because we previously owned a majority if Indura and were already consolidating results, there was no impact to our reported sales, EBITDA or operating income. This purchase is reflected in the financing activity section of our cash flow statement and the redeemable non-controlling interest that was shown on our balance sheet is now eliminated.","Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Thanks, Scott. Please turn to slide 16. First, I would like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team for delivering a very strong FY 2015. Implementing the five-point plan was our key focus this year. We decentralized the organization to create greater local authority and accountability and more of an entrepreneurial spirit. This allowed us to significantly reduce our cost structure.","Our new incentive system, which energizes and rewards local teams for their EBITDA performance, focuses us on cash flow and reinforces the cultural changes we are driving. We have more to do in terms of safety, speed, simplicity and self-confidence, but we are excited to be on our way.","The hard work of our people combined with our streamlined and faster organization produced tremendous results in every region. For the full fiscal 2015, Americas' EBITDA margin was up 450 basis points despite modest economic growth. EMEA's EBITDA margin was up 180 basis points despite weak economic growth. And Asia's EBITDA margin was 210 basis points despite the merchant overcapacity and slowing economy in China.","Our people delivered these results by staying focused on what we control, namely, working safely and driving costs out with the new and simpler organization, and we stay focused on customers. As Seifi has mentioned, we are very excited to be awarded a number of key projects this year that will support profitable growth into the future.","We had a pair of announcements in the last two weeks on our U.S. Gulf Coast pipeline system. First is a new agreement to supply 44 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen from our pipeline system to Pallas for ammonia production in Pasadena, Texas. Pallas will enjoy the speed, simplicity and reliability that comes from the world's largest hydrogen pipeline network.","Second is a new world-class steam methane reformer we will build in Baytown, Texas. This plant will provide 125 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen to support the growth on our U.S. Gulf Coast system, and it will provide additional reliable supply of carbon monoxide to our petrochemical customers. Great examples of Air Products wining in the marketplace while creating value for shareholders.","The team is excited about the opportunity to further improve the business. Having completed our reorganization, we are very focused on operational productivity to drive additional P&L improvement regardless of the economic environment.","With that, please turn to slide 17 for a review of our Gases-Americas, which includes Latin America, fourth quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on cost expanded our margins. Sales of $902 million were down 13% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 9% and currency reduced sales by 4%.","Underlying sales were flat as higher pricing offset lower volumes. We continue to see lower demand in Latin America helium and the oilfield services market. We also saw a further weakening of steel demand that impacts our oxygen sales and argon co-production. And as I mentioned last quarter, wholesale pipeline oxygen sales are down, and we will replace that volume with retail business. HyCO volumes were essentially flat as refiners continue to run hard.","Pricing was up 2% with continued strength in helium, and we worked hard to cover inflationary and power cost increases in Latin America","Operating income of $209 million was down 5% and EBITDA of $330 million was down 3% as profit headwinds from currency, higher incentive compensation and lower energy pass-through more than offset the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs. Record operating margin was up 190 basis points with about three-quarters of that coming from lower energy pass-through. Record EBITDA margin was up about 370 basis points.","As I said, the team is excited about driving further business improvement in 2016 despite an uncertain economic environment and more scheduled maintenance outages.","Now, please turn to slide 18. For the Europe, Middle East and Africa regional business, we saw the benefit of our cost restructuring actions as both EBITDA and operating margin set new records, both up about 200 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $460 million were reduced 14% due to currency, primarily the euro and the British pound. Underlying sales were up 2% with volumes up 1% and pricing up 1%.","Our liquid bulk volumes were positive while we continue to see volume weakness in the packaged gases business, in part due to weakness in the offshore oil and gas market. And as I said last quarter, we continue to see some negative volume impacts on our Rotterdam hydrogen pipeline, in part due to transportation fuel imports from the U.S. negatively impacting European refinery operations and in part due to the closure of a hydrogen plant there.","We are pleased to see another quarter of positive pricing. Operating margin was up 190 basis points while operating income was down 2% as the positive contribution from pricing and our cost reduction actions was more than offset by the currency impact and higher incentive compensation. EBITDA margin was up 220 basis points while EBITDA was down 5%. On a constant currency basis, operating income was up 11%. We will continue to prove the business in 2016, but expect seasonally weak volumes and planned maintenance outages to impact Q1.","Please turn to slide 19. Gases-Asia delivered another strong quarter with new plants driving both volume and profit growth. Versus last year, sales were up 7% to $428 million with volumes up 15% primarily from the new plants, partially offset by a negative 7% impact from currency primarily in Korea, Taiwan and China.","Overall merchant volumes were up mid-single digits across Asia. Our China retail LOX\/LIN business was up low-mid-single digits, while overall China LOX\/LIN was down as we focused on increasing our retail business while reducing wholesale volume. We still see end market demand growth in China but excess capacity continues to impact merchant pricing.","As I mentioned last quarter, the majority of our plants in China are protected by secure take-or-pay terms. And with the large on-site plants coming onstream, this proportion of our business is only growing. The first phases of the largest oxygen on-site complex Air Products has ever built started up in Yulin. As our customer brings their gasifiers fully online, we will bring on additional phases through the first half of FY 2016.","As I also mentioned last quarter, occasionally we will see swings in the energy pass-through around customer startups. This has no impact on profit, but it can impact sales and margins. Once again, most importantly, customers are executing their projects, operating their gasifiers, taking oxygen and we are getting paid.","Our reported profitability was very strong, with operating income up 40% and operating margin up 620 basis points, while EBITDA was up 17% and EBITDA margin was up 330 basis points. Our underlying business remains strong and we are seeing the benefits of the new projects coming onstream and our cost reduction actions. In addition, this quarter's comparison benefited from some one-time cost items last year and a positive catch-up payments from on-site customers this quarter.","As we look to 2016, the Asia team is focused on driving business improvement and continuing to start up the large projects in our backlog. We would expect Q1 FY 2016 to be closer to Q1 FY 2015 due to some of the one-time benefits I mentioned.","I'll close with a few words about the Global gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Unit sale of equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gas business which are not regional specific. Our overall sales were flat with last year, although the business mix was different, with lower small equipment sales and higher ASU sales. This significant profit improvement versus last year was driven by our cost reduction actions and positive project performance and closeouts.","Now, I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology","Thank you, Corning. On September 16, Air Products announced the intention to separate our Materials Technologies business through a tax-free spinoff to our U.S. shareholders. This strategic decision will allow both Materials Technologies and Air Products Industrial Gases to leverage our respective strengths and will enable better business performance for both companies over the long term.","The Materials Technologies team is very excited about the tremendous opportunity to remain focused on executing our strategy while driving safety, business improvement and taking care of our customers. At the same time, a number of us are working on the key steps required to enable the spin-off.","We're making good progress and continue to expect to complete the transaction before September 2016. Prior to the transaction, I look forward to the opportunity to spend time with you to share more details on our plans for the future success of this business.","Please turn to slide 20. In Q4, segment sales of $490 million were down 13% versus prior year, including a negative 4% impact from currency. Underlying sales were down 9% on 11% lower volumes and 2% higher prices. As I indicated on the last call, we have begun seeing some of the softening in the macro demand across our portfolio, especially in Asia and particularly in Delivery Systems.","Let me share with you the key drivers for Q4 results. For the Electronics segment, the 9% underlying sales reduction is all due to the Delivery Systems business. As we discussed in the past, this business consists of both equipment sales and turnkey installation work. We completed several major turnkey projects last year which did not repeat. These projects had a big impact on 2014 Q4 and 2015 Q1.","We also saw the anticipated impact of the CapEx spending softening in the semiconductor industry this quarter. Excluding Delivery Systems, the underlying sales of Electronics was up 15% relative to prior year.","Advanced Materials continues to show strength in innovation-driven growth as well as growth from our materials targeting memory and new technology nodes. Processed Materials held up well on continued strong memory market demand, but we are now running at capacity for several of our key products. We continue to focus on driving productivity, yield improvement, as well as expanding capacity at some of our key plants.","Performance Materials sales were down 8% on a constant currency basis on lower volumes across all three businesses. Epoxy volumes were impacted by weaker oil and gas, pipe and tank, and marine coatings demand. Additives volumes were impacted by oil and gas and mining weakness. And polyurethane additives volumes were down on weaker auto and appliance demand. Additive sales were also impacted by the deflationary pricing environment driven by lower oil prices and falling raw material prices.","Currency continues to be a significant headwind for our business. As you know, for the Industrial Gases business, currency is almost completely a translational item. But for Materials Technologies business, given the global nature of our supply network, we also have transaction impact from currency, especially in Performance Materials where North America supplies a significant portion of our demand in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Sequentially, sales were impacted by currency, weaker delivery systems and lower Performance Materials demand.","Despite the volume weakness, EBITDA of $140 million resulted in a margin increase of 130 basis points and operating income of $116 million resulted in a margin increase of 160 basis points. Profits would have been roughly flat versus last year on a constant currency basis. Currency, lower Performance Materials volumes, softer Delivery Systems demand, inventory revaluation from deflationary pricing and higher incentive compensation costs were partially offset by strong margin management, improvement in our business mix, productivity and our cost-reduction actions.","For Materials Technologies excluding Delivery Systems, our EBITDA would have been up low-to-mid single digits despite the currency headwinds.","Please turn to slide 21 for a review of our full-year results. During fiscal year 2015, the Materials Technologies team delivered a tremendous result, a second year of significant improvement in the quality of our business. Despite modest end market growth, we increased both operating margins and EBITDA margins by over 400 basis points. Innovation, margin management actions and cost focus more than offset headwinds from weak macroeconomic demand, currency and higher incentive compensation. As I shared with you last quarter, we have been able to capture significant volume growth and several of our businesses are now running their plants at very high utilization rates. We have initiated several investments to expand capacity in both the U.S. and in Asia.","These investments include our new Performance Materials production facility in Texas, capacity expansions in Processed Materials and Advanced Materials and productivity improvement investments. Our rapid growth and tight capacity will limit our volume growth capabilities in the early part of 2016 but will support our longer term growth expectations starting the second half of the year.","Even with these investments, the Materials Technologies business still generates a very high level of free cash flow. Our maintenance CapEx is only about 1.5% of sales and our growth capital average is 2% to 3% of sales on a normalized basis. Innovation continues to be at the core of our organic growth and for our future products and solutions for our customers.","We are confident in the returns we're getting from our technology investments and are committed to maintaining the technology leadership in the market segments we're focused on. Overall, while we're disappointed by the market demand for Performance Materials, we are pleased with our innovation initiatives and the hard work around productivity, margin management and cost actions by the team.","Regardless of the weaker macroeconomic conditions, currency and raw material dynamics, we drove margin improvements in Q4 and for the full year. For Electronics, while there are signs of softening demand, we do not foresee a significant downturn in the electronics industry. For Performance Materials, we expect to continue to see challenges from macro demand and currency.","Regardless of the macroeconomic headwinds, we expect to improve our profitability and deliver higher profits in 2016 than we did in 2015. However, we do expect to see our typical seasonal profit drop from Q4 to Q1, so more of the improvement will come in the second half of the fiscal year.","We are executing and remain focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement. Equally important, we're committed to meeting or exceeding our timeline for the spin-off of Materials Technologies as a stand-alone company.","This is the second year of strong performance improvement for Materials Technologies. I'm certain that I can speak for the entire team that we are committed to adding value to our customers, to the success of our business and to creating an exciting and profitable future for all stakeholders. Again, I look forward to spending time with you to discuss our business in more details.","I provided you details on how our business is performing this year, this quarter and into next year. But let me summarize and re-emphasize that we expect to deliver higher profits from Materials Technologies in fiscal year 2016 than we did in fiscal year 2015. The improvements we've made over the last two years have fundamentally changed and strengthened the Materials Technologies business and positioned us well to continue to deliver profitable growth.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for quick comments on the Corporate segment.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Guillermo. Our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which are not business-specific. Sales were up this quarter versus last year as we continue to see higher LNG sales more than offsetting lower helium container sales. The LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY 2016 results. The improved profitability this quarter was primarily driven by the higher LNG activity and the benefit of reduced corporate costs.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you again, Simon. Now, please turn to slide number 22 for a discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team continues to stay focused on our goal of becoming the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have made great progress in fiscal year 2015 and delivered a 14% improvement in our operating profit. And we expect to continue our journey during fiscal year 2016.","Our guidance for fiscal year 2016 is to actually deliver earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.50 per share. At mid point, this will be an increase of $0.81 or 12% over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.75. At mid point, this will be an increase of $0.15 or 10% over the fiscal first quarter of last year.","The full year and quarterly guidance obviously includes Materials Technologies. We expect our CapEx expense to be about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2016 which is down slightly from this year. As you have seen from our recent project announcements, we see great opportunities to invest Air Products substantial cash flow into good high-return projects in our core Industrial Gases business. Despite an uncertain economic environment, the Air Products team will stay focused, as they did this year, to take actions that we control to actually deliver the results that we promise despite economic conditions or currency exchange rates.","I would like to add that I have now been Chairman and CEO of Air Products for the past 16 months. I am now convinced more than ever that Air Products has a great future ahead of it. We do have an outstanding team of talented, dedicated and motivated people who are driving change, and we are blessed with having the great portfolio of businesses around the world with more than 700,000 outstanding customers to serve.","I'm proud of our people and considered it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team. Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go first to Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Mr. Fischer, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, fellows.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Duffy. How are you?","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good. Thanks. Maybe start on Seifi's favorite slide, slide 8. Very impressive performance in the margin there. Can you break out into buckets where the big chunks of that have come from? How much has been from the cost savings? How much has been from new plants coming online? And then maybe talk about how that would have been different than what you would have thought day one that you took the job where that was going to come from?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, approximately half of that 700 basis points is cost savings and the other half is related to price increases, volumes and the new plants coming onstream. And in terms of my expectations the day that I started, I thought that it would take us three years to get that 300 basis points improvement and it has been accomplished in one year and I'm very proud of that.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then from your slide 9 where you walked through the cash flow there, maintenance capital last year was $311 million, maintenance capital this year $250 million. When you think about maintenance capital, I would have thought there isn't that much variation from year to year. How should we think about a normalized maintenance cap level for you guys?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We have always said that order of magnitude around $300 million.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. Thank you.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you, guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Duffy.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. You said that your CapEx next year would be, I don't know, $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion. Is that also your non-GAAP CapEx or is your non-GAAP CapEx different?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, you want to...","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Hi, Jeff. That is both our GAAP and non-GAAP CapEx. We haven't been doing \u2013 the adjustment that you're referring to is the capital leases in the 2001-2008. We haven't been doing those lately, so that's both GAAP and non-GAAP.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And you were kind enough to give an indication of what you thought you would earn next year. Your GAAP earnings have been lower than your adjusted earnings. Do you have an idea of what your GAAP range would be for next year?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't expect too many so called one-off items. The biggest one-off items we have had this year has been the restructuring, which has been about $212 million, $213 million. And next year, there will be some restructuring charge, but I don't expect the magnitude to be as big, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Couple of questions on China. First, three major projects you're starting up with 20,000 tons per day of oxygen. What is the EPS impact of these projects? And then secondly, you mentioned that you have this new strategy of increasing your retail sales in China and reducing your wholesale volumes in China. Can you just talk a little bit more about that strategy?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think Corning would be delighted to answer the questions.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","So I'm not sure that we've given out specific guidance on specific projects, but I think, in general, we would expect them to come in with the profitability that you would expect from the guidelines we put out. I think the key point is this is a question of exactly what's the timing and when are they on and fully onstream but, again, we see all of our customers progressing their plants, building them to construction. They don't operate without oxygen, so they need us and they pay us for it. I don't expect big surprises there.","In terms of retail versus wholesale, so I think it's common when people first bring on a new liquefier that in terms of getting loading, a lot of that volume may go into a wholesale sort of environment. We don't have new liquid to bring on at this point. All of our liquid is currently on.","And so we're naturally in the process of preferentially signing and selling to retail customers and, to a large extent, that's about application sales, helping customers to be more efficient and more productive in their own operations and that's something you can do in any economic environment, right, because you're helping them to be more competitive.","And when you think an emerging market, right, they're not typically as, let's say, industrial gas intensive or developed as a more mature economy and that's another reason we're able to push that in China today even in the current economic environment.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And my second question is on your free cash flow. Can you talk about sort of if you have any growth, long term growth for free cash flow? And Scott, maybe a rationale for buying out Indura now? Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead.","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So in terms of free cash flow, as we've talked in the past, we're going to make sure that we maintain our A rating. We're going to drive EBITDA up, generating as much cash out of the existing assets we have and then we're going to evaluate the growth opportunities with organic growth opportunities being the ones that we're going to be able to create the most value for our shareholder. That's what we done under Seifi over the last 16 months and that's what we're going to continue going forward.","In terms of Indura, that was exercised by our minority partner per the contract, and so that was a put that he put to us. And now that we own that, we have the opportunities to take control and drive improvements across the business that we weren't able to do previously.","By the way, you'll see that also in a variety of forms, including the fact that we paid down some high cost debt, about $147 million bond that was out there at roughly 10%. And so, we're going to see some improvement in interest expense as part of what we did here this quarter. So, another example of the things that we're doing in Indura to drive improvement.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, P.J.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","Hi, David.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Seifi, very impressive margins in Gases-Americas, EBITDA of 34.9% in 2015. How much higher can it go in 2016 do you think?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously, some of that is dependent, David, on what the economy will do and what kind of a leverage we get. But at the same time, we have said that we are going to have another $75 million of cost savings in 2016. A lot of that is in the Americas, so I expect those margins to continue to improve.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just on Tees Valley, Seifi, do you have an update? And what should we think about the impact from a earnings standpoint from Tees Valley to be in 2016?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There will be no income from Tees Valley in 2016. In our forecast that we have given you, there is no consideration for any contribution from Tees Valley.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Will it be a loss-making entity in 2016?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Will it lose money in 2016?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I don't expect it to lose money.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Seifi, I want to follow up on Tees. I recognize your desire to be pretty cautious and conservative on that. But you guys are plunking down $1 billion. And at the time the contracts were written, I thought they were fixed price. Has something changed about the revenue base that you'd previously contracted for that would put it into a breakeven position instead of a moneymaker?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the Tees Valley, Bob, we are in the process of starting up that plant. So we don't expect that plant to really be in commercial operation in 2016. So that's why we have assumed that it would not be contributing to the bottom line.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry. Just to be clear, so the contract terms you had on the waste fee, power fee, renewables, none of that's changed? It's just the ability to get it into commercialization and it's...","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...I guess it's at least three years behind. Is that an indictment of the technology or is there some other issue at work?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. It's just related to the technology. We have always said that there is a chance that the technology will not work, Bob, so we are still working to figure out whether it does work or not.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's a good chance that it doesn't work, so we have to be aware of that and I have been mentioning that for the past year.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. And then, let me ask you more broadly, Seifi, I mean, from your prior tenure in the gases industry, it seems like the world has gotten much tougher for industrial gas companies. I know your volumes in the last year are up about 2%. I think your friends at Praxair, they're down 1% or 2% so far this year. I think the packaged guys in the U.S. Airgas are down a little bit. But the globe hasn't been in a recession. So is there something fundamentally broken about the old multipliers between gases demand and economic growth?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, I don't really see that. I think that what we are facing with right now in terms of the growth in volume is just that the LOX\/LIN volumes are down. But when you look at our on-site facilities, the volumes are not that far down. We are making significant progress in China and I think in the long term there is a lot of opportunities for industrial gases. And I think all of the industrial gas companies in time will enjoy about 1.5 times GDP growth rates. I don't see any fundamental change in that.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the help.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, Bob.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","Take care, Bob.","Operator","And we'll go next to Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group","Yes. Thank you. Seifi, just wondering, in next year's guidance, how much greater is the contribution from new projects? And as you look at the backlog, I notice you indicated your new Baytown facility was sold out the day you announced it. So should we assume more announcements on U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen, and could that be offset by sort of the end of the Chinese coal gasification opportunity?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, I don't expect that the Chinese coal gasification would \u2013 that it is the end. I think there's still a lot of opportunity there, and we will appropriately participate on that. We have gotten off of the habit of giving you a specific forecast about new projects because that is too much competitive information to give away. So I apologize for not giving you that.","But we are very optimistic. You have seen the projects that we have announced. And we are saying that next year, our forecast right now is that we will increase our profits by 15% as compared to other people. So I think that's a good indication that we will see additional volumes.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And then as a follow-up on price, I notice your October 1st price increase initiative. It seems pretty aggressive for North America, given where operating rates are, I think 20% on liquid argon, 15% LIN\/LOX. And I know these take time to roll through, but are conditions in the North American merchant market improving to the point where you think you can get a lot of this price?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously, we hope that that would be the case. And then what happens in the real world, it remains to be seen but it certainly is our intent to implement the price increases.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Roberts of UBS.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. 2016 will be the fourth year of lower capital spending. Based on these new wins and so forth you've been having recently, do you think this is the bottom in 2016?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't want \u2013 well, you have to consider that Air Products spent a significant amount of money on the waste to energy project. Obviously, we are not going to invest in waste to energy projects in the future. So if you take that out, then I think we will continue to see a growth in the investment in the gases business.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, the total number might decline but gases would be turning around?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then, in the Materials segment, the dispensing equipment part of the business has always had greater cyclicality. I don't believe that you manufacture the equipment. So, is there a different business model you might take in that business that would make it more variabilized so that you reduce the cyclicality on the total business?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a very good question. I'm going to have Guillermo address that question.","Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology","Thank you for the question. If you look at our Delivery Systems business, it's roughly around 10% of the portfolio. As I indicated, there's really two parts to it: the equipment side and the turnkey projects. The equipment side, we actually do manufacture all the delivery equipment both for the specialty gases, the specialty materials and we also have a business for slurry delivery in part of the portfolio.","So those we do manufacture and we do sell. There is some volatility in that part of it, but it's pretty steady. Where we get the majority of the volatility is in the turnkey projects, and those are really project-driven activities. And those are just going to be the nature of when the projects come. But the turnkey projects is not the majority of the business.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jim. How are you?","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Say, on your 2016 outlook, what are you incorporating there as your assumption for FX headwinds, and how much of the growth is going to be attributable to organic growth, please?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In the forecast that we have given you, we have assumed that we will have a hit of about $0.10 for exchange rate translation. That's the assumption that is in there. In terms of organic growth versus \u2013 we have assumed not much of a organic growth because we don't believe that the economic conditions around the world will be that robust next year. So, most of our growth is going to \u2013 the growth in EPS is going to come from cost reduction and from our on-site businesses.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jim.","Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Manthey of Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Seifi, it looks like you achieved the first $300 million of cost improvement about three months ahead of your recent plan, so you're on to the next $300 million. Can you outline some of the examples of operational improvement that you hope to achieve over this four-year period?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think I'd like to have Corning kind of address this because he is in charge of the delivering the other $300 million. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Thank you, Seifi. So, the reality is in this business, the nature of our business, this is the 10,000 little things that we talk about. And even if I was going to say improving spec power, well, it's spec power over many different plants, all of whom have their own operating situation. So I think the thing I'd really like to stress here is what enables you to drive 10,000 things better than you used to? And it heavily goes to the organizational changes that we've made, right? So, we've gone to a much more decentralized and empowered field organization where those production assets are.","Number two, we have one owner for these assets. It used to be there might be someone who had the tonnage business or electronics business and then the merchant business, different debates about how to optimize the use of that. That's over. That's done. That's behind us. And then, we've got the incentive plan, right, which motivates every one of these local teams to think about their EBITDA, how do they drive productivity, every one of them each day. And I think those three drivers are a very powerful move that's moving us through to optimize those 10,000 and to hit these productivity targets.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And your confidence level there, I would imagine you have folks that have run these types of facilities for you that have also run them at other companies and roughly 300 basis points of the overall you think is a reasonable estimate for how inefficient your operations are relative to what something would be running it if it's optimal today?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","So, I think I'd rather not get into is it optimal, unoptimal today, this and that. I think a couple of things here. Number one, there is something going on in this company and we are absolutely, positively committed to being the safest and most profitable company while giving our customers excellent service. That's what this is about. And if other companies move up, then we just need to do more. We are committed to that. We're motivated for that. We've kind of unleashed the productivity with this new organization. And do we see opportunities to do things better in line with what we're doing? Yes. Do we have plans in place for this? Yes, we do.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just a quick one for you, Scott. In Asia, you mentioned there were these catch-up payments. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on what they were, whether there are any more to come going forward and whether they were 100% margin in the quarter? That'd be helpful.","Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Corning?","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. Thank you. So these are, of course, specific to an individual or a set of customers, so it's very difficult to go into the specifics about them. I think the key point is associated typically with a start-up and which products they want and where are we in terms of the start-up process at different points in time. And perhaps the other really key point is we've collected everything. So it's all in the P&L and it's all been in. And so I don't see that repeating in a significant way going forward.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right Vince. Okay. Why don't we take one more question?","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. We knew you were on the line, so go ahead, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Was curious if you could delineate what the split is between your retail and wholesale merchant volumes in China now and how has that changed over time?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, I think Corning can answer that question easily. Go ahead, Corning.","Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases","Yeah. Because of the competitive nature, I think we would rather not go into the specifics of this other than to say that, let's say, in LOX\/LIN, we are, at this point, certainly predominantly retail direct to customers, and we see a slow but steady improvement. With a large basis like that, it doesn't change overnight. But I'd rather not get into exact specifics just for competitive reasons.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. And then, looking at the Industrial Gases- Global segment, there was much better profitability this quarter. You called out some lower costs, but are we starting to see the Jazan ASU sales trickle in there and can you give any guidance for that segment for next year?","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There isn't much of Jazan in the numbers that we have for 2015. And for 2016, I think Jazan is a project that is a 20-year project and the profits will come after the plant starts up four years from now. For 2016, we are going to be very cautious in recognizing any profit in terms of the sales from the plant because these plants need to come onstream. You had a lot of obligations in terms of performance guarantees and all of that. So one has to be cautious and there is a lot of accounting rules that we have to follow on that. So there isn't a lot of projections for a lot of profit for that in 2016.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And so with that, I'd like to thank everybody.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today\u2019s call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Simon Moore","Thank you, Leanne. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products\u2019 First Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I\u2019m pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.","After our comments, we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.","This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide 2. In addition, throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, we are referring to adjusted non-GAAP measures, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin on both a company-wide and segment basis and ROCE. Reconciliations can be found on our website in the Relevant Earnings Release section.","Now I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon, and good morning everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I would like to thank everybody at Air Products to again delivering a very strong quarter. We are very pleased with our earnings per share of $2.14 for the first quarter, up 15% over last year\u2019s strong results and the 23rd, I\u2019d like to repeat that, the 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth.","Please now turn to Slide Number 3. Safety is always the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and our goal continues to be zero accidents and incidents. I was pleased to see improvement this quarter as our people redoubled their efforts so that we can move towards our ultimate goal of an accident-free work environment.","Slide Number 4 shows our goal and Slide Number 5 shows our management philosophy. I have discussed this with you many times before, so I don\u2019t want to take your time to repeat it, but those slides are very important guiding principles that we follow.","Now please turn to Slide Number 6, our Five-Point Plan that we have discussed with you in detail before. But I do not want to focus on our past performance because, frankly, I like the dreams of the future more than the history of the past. Our dream of the future is to make sure Air Products will continue to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers. Our dream of the future is for Air Products to become the largest American chemical company as measured by market capitalization. We will achieve this by focusing on growth, driven by our core competencies.","Our dream of the future is for Air Products to be the leader in providing solutions to the world\u2019s environmental sustainability challenges through gasification of coal, pet coke and refinery residues, developing solutions to capture CO2 from gasifiers and hydrogen plants and further developing technologies and making Air Products the leader in providing hydrogen for transportation around the world. Our dream of the future is to be a company that has a higher purpose beyond just creating value for our shareholders through improved financial performance.","We want to be a company that people from all walks of life and nationalities come together, work together and feel that they belong and that their contribution matters and are appreciated; a company that is focused on innovation to solve the substantial environmental issues facing our humanity; a company that is passionate and contribute to the well-being of all the communities in which we operate around the world; a global company that brings people from all over the world together to collaborate, improve understanding and prevent conflicts that arise from misunderstanding. We are committed to work very hard to realize our dreams of the future by executing on our Five-Point Plan strategy.","Now please turn to Slide Number 7. You can see our exciting gasification strategy. We continue to be very focused on successfully executing this strategy and the announced projects, and we are making excellent progress, and we continue to be very optimistic about this sector.","Slide Number 8 summarizes the Gulf Coast Ammonia project we announced earlier in January. As I said, this is the largest U.S. investment in the history of Air Products and winning this project is a direct result of the value of our Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline, the competitiveness of our hydrogen plants and our expertise to develop, build and operate the largest projects in the history of industrial gas industry. As a result, this project will exceed our commitments in terms of financial returns.","Please now turn to Slide Number 9. We have talked extensively about the significant opportunities for capital investment to generate significant shareholder value. At the same time, the cash generation strength of our existing business allows us to be confident in raising our dividend for the 38th consecutive year. The more than 15% increase we announced yesterday to $1.34 per share per quarter is the largest per share dividend increase in our history and will result in almost $1.2 billion directly returned to our shareholders in form of dividend next year.","Now please turn to my favorite slide, Slide Number 10. You can see that our EBITDA margin continues to be more than 40%, which is up over 1,500 basis points from early 2014.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to give you the details of our very good financial performance. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you very much Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 11 for our first quarter results.","Our team delivered another strong start to the year. Volume and price together increased 9% and were up in all three regions. We delivered double-digit profit growth despite the soft economic activity around the world.","Sales grew modestly to $2.3 billion as strong underlying sales were offset by 5% lower energy pass-through and 2% due to the India contract modification. The India contract was modified in December 2018. So this is the last quarter we will see a year-on-year impact. Weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Chinese RMB and euro lowered sales by another 1%. Volume growth of 6% was primarily driven by modest base business growth, new plants, acquisitions and a short-term contract in Asia.","Price was up 3%, the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price increase.","EBITDA topped $900 million, up 14%, and EPS of $2.14 was up 15%. EBITDA margin was over 40%, the third consecutive quarter exceeding the 40% mark, up 460 basis points, primarily driven by the higher price and the strong volumes.","Lower energy pass-through and the India contract modification contributed about half of the margin increase. Sequentially, profits are down, primarily on seasonality in the regions and incentive compensation adjustments primarily in our corporate segment. ROCE continues to improve up 100 basis points over last year. We are pleased with the almost 300 basis point improvement since 2015 and we anticipate further improvement as we increase earnings and deploy more of the cash on our balance sheet.","Now please turn to Slide 12. Our fourth quarter EPS of $2.14 was up $0.28 per share or 15% driven by strong operating performance. Volume and price together contributed $0.40, cost was unfavorable $0.12 as we continued to invest in business development and R&D resources to support our growth strategy. Equity affiliate income was favorable $0.02, while non-controlling interest was unfavorable $0.02. The non-operating factors in total have no net impact this quarter.","Our effective tax rate of 19.8% was up 80 basis points from last year. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 20% to 21% in fiscal year 2020. Interest expense was $0.07 lower this quarter as we paid off a bond last quarter and adopted new accounting guidance that moves about $9 million per quarter from interest expense to non-operating expense.","Now please turn to Slide 13. We continue to generate strong cash flow. For the last 12 months, we generated over $2.7 billion or $12.30 per share of distributable cash flow. From this distributable cash flow, we paid almost 40% or $1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.7 billion available for high return industrial gas investments. As Seifi mentioned, this strong cash flow enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.","Slide number 14 provides an update on our capital deployment progress. As you can see, we now show over $18 billion of investment capacity available over the five year period from FY2018 through FY2022. As expected, our total capacity continues to grow as we increase EBITDA. The over $18 billion includes almost $10 billion of additional debt capacity available today, almost $5 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY2022 and over $3 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A\/A2 rating. Today we have a total of about $8 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $7 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent 20% and already committed well over half of our total available capacity.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Scott. I\u2019m very pleased to say that we generated excellent results in all our operating geographies. All three regions reported double-digit profit growth and significant margin expansion. We are not depending on economic growth around the world, but are meeting our commitments to you through our own actions by realizing value we provide to our customers and by successfully executing high return growth projects.","Now please turn to Slide number 15, where you can see that our team in Asia has again delivered another set of outstanding results. As we have previously mentioned, trade tensions have not significantly impacted our business, our customers and the Chinese government continues to support Air Products projects and we remain very optimistic about our long-term prospects in this important region of the world.","For the quarter, sales increased 11% from last year with volume and price together up 13%. Volumes increased 9% driven by new projects, base business growth and a short-term supply contract. As a reminder, the year-on-year impact of Lu\u2019An has lapsed since the project has been successfully operating for more than a year. Overall pricing for the region increased 4%, and actually our merchant pricing increased by 10%, the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Price was positive in all key countries.","Profits and margins were higher, driven by the strong volume and price. EBITDA increased 16% and EBITDA margin expanded 260 points to just over 50%. Sequentially, sales and profit soften as the impact of lower volumes including less benefit from the short-term supply contracts was partially offset by productivity. As you would expect, we do anticipate a seasonal slowdown during Lunar New Year holiday in quarter two.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to discuss our Americas result. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Americas results. Americas\u2019 strong pricing trend continued, up 3%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of the year-on-year improvement. Price was better across all major product lines and in all subregions. Volume was up 1% driven by stronger Gulf Coast hydrogen volumes with less planned customer maintenance outages than last year. This was partially offset by persistent economic weakness in South America. Lower energy pass-through reduced sales by 8%.","EBITDA of $410 million increased 11% supported by a better price, higher volume and lower maintenance costs. EBITDA margin of almost 44% was up almost 700 basis points, primarily due to better price, lower maintenance and improved productivity. Energy pass-through also contributed about 300 basis points. Looking into next quarter, we anticipate higher and above average maintenance spending due to planned life extension work on several facilities. We expect our full year maintenance expense to be within our normal range.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?","Simon Moore","Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa results. Our EMEA business continued to generate strong price, volume and profit growth despite the challenging economic conditions in the region. Volume was up 6%, primarily driven by increased hydrogen volumes in our Rotterdam pipeline system and the CO2 business we acquired last year, while base merchant business volume remains stable.","Price increased 3% with improvement across all major products and subregions. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Sales were negatively impacted by 8% from the India contract change, 4% from lower energy pass-through and 2% from unfavorable currency. As Scott mentioned, the India contract was modified in December of 2018, so this is the last quarter we will see a year-on-year impact. EBITDA of $188 million was up 14% supported by the strong price and volume. And EBITDA margin of nearly 38% improved over 600 basis points. The India contract change in lower energy pass-through contributed about 400 basis points of this improvement.","Now please turn to Slide 18, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sales equipment businesses as well as central industrial gas costs. Other project activities offset the expected lower results from the successful Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. However, we don\u2019t expect these other project activities to continue at this level.","Please turn to Slide 19. Corporate segment, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales were higher this quarter, supported by contributions from the Golden Pass LNG project. Profits were flat as the improved contribution from LNG was offset by higher corporate costs as we continue to build our capabilities and strengthen our organization to successfully pursue our significant growth opportunities. Sequentially, results were down as LNG had a lower quarter on normal sale of equipment profit timing, and we saw relatively higher costs, including incentive compensation. We remain very optimistic about additional LNG orders since our technology has been selected for several major projects around the world that are awaiting final investment decisions or final agreements with our customers.","Now I\u2019m pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, again, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 20. As you all know, and it\u2019s pretty obvious, we continue to live in an uncertain world that we at Air Products cannot control. But we do have control over the actions Air Products can take to succeed in a dynamic and changing world. We have a strong, capable and flexible organization that remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promise to investors. Despite this uncertainty, there is no change in our fiscal year 2020 EPS guidance of $9.35 to $9.60, which is up 14% to 17% over our strong fiscal year 2019 performance.","As we continue to expect our fiscal \u2013 we continue to expect our fiscal year 2020 CapEx to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. For second quarter of fiscal year 2020, our earnings per share guidance is $2.10 to $2.20, which at midpoint is up 12% versus last year.","Now please turn to Slide 21. At midpoint, our fiscal year 2020 guidance represents six consecutive years of double-digit earnings growth and 14% average earnings per share growth over this time. Thanks to the great team at Air Products, we continue to deliver on our commitments. Our team around the world continues to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products. Our Five-Point strategic plan will differentiate us and drive our success going forward. Our safety, productivity and operating performance provide the foundation for our continued growth. We have the financial capacity, the technical position and the talent to take a full advantage of our exciting opportunities, and I\u2019d like to stress that we see \u2013 we do see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead of us.","And finally, please turn to Slide 22. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our strong performance. I want to thank all of our 17,000 people around the world for their commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together. I certainly am proud to be part of this winning team.","With that, now we are delighted to answer any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Can you describe your volume growth in oxygen and nitrogen in the United States in the merchant area?","Seifi Ghasemi","Jeff, good morning.","Jeff Zekauskas","Good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","We would prefer not to get into that detail, Jeff. Because that is obviously a very significant competitive information, and we usually do not disclose that. I\u2019m sorry about that. But hope you bear with us that we want to stick with that policy.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. You\u2019re going to spend $4 billion to $4.5 billion in CapEx this year. Does that amount of spending lead to some costs coming into the income statement in advance of the capital projects coming on stream? In other words, are your current returns being penalized at all by the large capital expenditure budget that you have for this year?","Seifi Ghasemi","Jeff, you make a very good point. As you notice from our results, our cost, I mean, if you focus on the cost, you see increasing cost. That\u2019s not because we have become less efficient. That is because we are building the organization in anticipation of executing these projects. So you are very correct that we will see, as you are seeing, some increase in cost. It is not that significant, but it is there, and you\u2019re very \u2013 it\u2019s very appropriate for you to point that out.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you so much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, sir.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning everyone. I have a follow-up on the $0.12 of cost increase in the quarter. The investments you\u2019re making to grow the business, Jeff, obviously, just talked about the existing plants. How much of the spend is going towards future opportunities like hydrogen mobility or other things because I was just curious on the R&D side of the equation, what it is that you\u2019re driving at?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, the expenditures are in two aspects. One is, obviously, R&D expenditure, which is you kind of know about how much we are spending, it is not that huge. But the other thing is actually hiring very high quality, experienced people to oversee the execution of these projects that we expect to get. We don\u2019t want to get the projects and then look for talent. We are putting the talent in place in anticipation of those projects, which we are sure will happen. So a significant part of the cost is the hiring and onboarding of all of these people, and there is a substantial number of people that we have brought in, especially to strengthen our technology section and our project execution capability.","Vincent Andrews","Got it. That makes sense. If I could just ask a follow-up on the dividend. Obviously, a very large increase, a record increase. Last year, when we talked about it, you mentioned that you historically has spoken to your investors about a 2.5% to 3% yield. Obviously, this takes you to about 2.25%. My assumption is that with the increase in the share price last year to go back to 2.50% to 3% would have been perhaps unattractive in terms of moving cash flow away from investment projects. But I guess the question is, how should we think about sort of the dividend growth algorithm going forward? Should we be thinking more about keeping the yield at 2.25% to 2.5% or what philosophy can you help us with this year?","Seifi Ghasemi","That\u2019s an excellent question. We obviously take a lot of different factors into consideration when we decide on the dividend. It\u2019s not just 2.5% of the stock price, but it\u2019s also our cash flow. I think you should expect that we would continue to give approximately half of our free cash flow as dividends. That has been kind of one guidance, and obviously, a percentage of the share price is another part. I personally think that we should continue to pay a very healthy dividend, something which is in the order of 2.5% of our share price and also about half of our free cash. So this year, I mean, we are increasing it 15%. It would have been ridiculous if we had to start right now and we can\u2019t anticipate what the share price will be. So we make the decision based on a lot of different factors that\u2019s in \u2013 but overall guidance, about half of our free cash or about 2.5% of the share price.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, very helpful. I appreciate it.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, sir.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good morning. Seifi, if I back out the effect of the India contract modification, it looks like your volume grew about 6% year-over-year. And so I have a two-part question. First, I was wondering if you could comment as to the effect of new projects in that number versus baseline volume growth? And then secondly, since you\u2019re one of the first chemical companies to report this season, just wondering if you could comment on which end-use markets might have trended better than expected? And if there are any that came in lower than your expectation? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Kevin. Excellent question. In terms of breaking down between organic growth and new projects, our basic approach has been not to disclose that detail. But I would like to specifically answer your second question. We obviously beat the forecast. The reason for that is that the economic growth in Asia was better than we expected. The economic growth in Europe didn\u2019t become as bad as we expected because of Brexit. And in the U.S., there was not much of a change, and Latin America continues to be a disaster. So overall, as we go forward, we are now a little bit more optimistic about Asia. Obviously, in the second quarter, you have the Lunar New Year and that dampens the growth, but we expect that to continue as we go forward in the other quarters. And I\u2019m hoping that things will kind of stabilize in Europe and in the U.S. But that\u2019s kind of how we see the thing.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. Can you just give us a real quick update on your various Saudi projects, primarily Jazan, the MOUs and just the future potential for a pipeline build-out? Just any additional framework on Saudi Arabia will be appreciated. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Hi, Chris. Chris, obviously, we are very honored and very proud to be given the gigantic project of the integrated gas project in Jazan. That is not only an equivalent of a $12 billion acquisition, but it also is a phenomenal reference in terms of our gasification capability. It is using the Shell technology and it is a gigantic project. So we are very happy with that. We are making a lot of progress on that. And I continue to be very optimistic that we will try \u2013 that we will be kind of complete the financing in this quarter. But you do need to appreciate, and I\u2019m sure you do, that we are going to go to the market for $7 billion of debt considering the different events in the world and all of that, things might not happen exactly on the date. But the fact of the matter is that we are talking about a 25-year project. So the impact on Air Product for the long-term is extremely positive. Now whether we actually close in the month of March or whether it is in the month of April, we\u2019ll see. But we continue to be very optimistic about that project. As I said, we are very proud of that. And quite frankly, you see that we have not changed our forecast. That means that we still believe that this will happen at the time that we thought at the beginning of the year. Is that okay, Chris?","Christopher Parkinson","That\u2019s very helpful. Just as a quick follow-up and a little bit longer-term one. Just carbon capture was just indistinctly a clear theme at Davos this year and was basically discussed across by pretty much every global leader, the IEA and plethora of oil companies, all of them with their own partner proprietary technology. Can you just update us on your own thoughts on this front? Whether your technologies fit into the broader equation? And how the investment community should at least begin to think about this opportunity as it pertains to Air Products? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Chris, we have recognized and made carbon capture a priority for the company five years ago. That is the future. That is a necessity in order to deal with the global warming. And I am very happy to see that responsible people are now actually talking about it. Hopefully, we were ahead of the game. We have been working on different technologies on this. The first thing is that we do have the technology to capture carbon from hydrogen plants and I think gasifiers and so on for enhanced oil recovery. We do have a commercial scale plant operating in Port Arthur. It\u2019s one of the biggest in the world, and we capture the CO2 and put it in the pipeline there for enhanced oil recovery. That kind of projects you should expect that we will do on a very large-scale around the world. The second thing is sequestration. We have developed technologies on that and we are working on that. And hopefully, in time, we will be able to announce the kind of commercial projects that we are doing. The third and most exciting thing is some new technologies that we are developing. And in respect to carbon capture in a different way, I don\u2019t want to go through the details of that because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate at this stage. We are laser-focused on carbon capture. If you look at our annual report, and we make it very clear, we say gasification today, carbon capture tomorrow and hydrogen for mobility the day after tomorrow. So, those are the priorities of our company, and we are obviously trying to be the leader on that, the same way that we became the leader in gasification.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.","John McNulty","Yes, thanks for taking my question. With regard to coal gasification in China, can you give us an update on the market there and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of interest and demand? I know certainly over the last year or so, there was a lot of demand and a lot of talk about it. We haven\u2019t necessarily seen a lot of new announcements. So I guess, can you give us an update on your confidence in that area?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, good morning, John. Hope all is well. We continue to be optimistic about that. We did announce the coal gasification project, as I\u2019m sure you saw, and we expect to announce some more in the years to come. We are working on Juitai. We announced Debang and there are other projects. We don\u2019t see any slowdown on that, and we are very optimistic about that, John.","John McNulty","Great, thanks. And then just a question on the helium markets. Can you speak to kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the industry right now and how you\u2019re seeing how that plays out through 2020?","Seifi Ghasemi","But John, I think it is not a secret that supply-demand situation in helium is challenging. Basically, there is not enough supply to meet the demand. And obviously, that has had an effect on the commercial value of helium. And you can \u2013 and you are seeing that in our results. In terms of 2020, I think that situation will continue, and it is quite possible that, that situation will continue for a few years to come. I don\u2019t want to anticipate that because it depends on the performance of the current sources or bringing on a stream of some other sources. But helium has such a small number of sources and so on. So, it\u2019s very transparent about what\u2019s going on. There are not that many places that produce helium. So it\u2019s very easy for investors and people like yourself to figure out what\u2019s going on.","John McNulty","Great, thanks very much for the color.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, John.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you, good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning, David.","David Begleiter","Can you give any new update on the Yankuang project? It\u2019s a large one, and it\u2019s still, I guess, progressing a little bit slowly here?","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes. There is no additional update. I\u2019ve always mentioned that, that project is a big project. We signed the Memorandum of Understanding in November of 2017 when the President was visiting China. That project is moving very slowly. Some of it is our fault. I have explained that, that we want to make sure that there is coal allocation before we go and invest $1.5 billion of our money there. So I think you should expect a slow progress on that project.","David Begleiter","Got it. And do you have the merchant price increases for both the Americas and EMEA, you gave us the Asia price increase? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Merchant price increases are the way we see it. Americas is about 7%, Europe is about 5%, and Asia is 10%.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","We usually don\u2019t disclose that detail, but since you asked the question, David, I had to answer you.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi, good morning, Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning, P.J. How are you?","P.J. Juvekar","I\u2019m doing great. Your EBITDA margins were 40%, which is great. If you take out the energy pass-through, EBITDA margins were closer to 37% to 38% and then there was also positive impact of India contract modification. So it seems like your sort of same-store EBITDA margins are in that mid-30s to maybe high 30s range. Is that a good range going forward? And how will the new coal gasification projects and your build-own operate model sort of impact those margins in the future?","Seifi Ghasemi","Order of magnitude, your math is correct, and we expect the margins to \u2013 sorry, the margins to continue to be in the range that you mentioned. But as we do these bigger projects that will improve. That has \u2013 that will have a positive effect on those margins. Sorry, I\u2019m losing my voice a little bit. But \u2013 so overall, you should expect that our margins will stay at around 38%, 37% to 40%, 49% \u2013 I mean, 39%, 40%, around that range.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. While you take a breath, let me ask a question to Scott. Working capital was a drag. And I\u2019m sure that was partly driven by new project startups, but your receivables were down, payables were up. Can you sort of shed more light on working capital drag? And how much of that impact is from new startups?","Scott Crocco","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, P.J. Our DSO was about 52 days. So we\u2019re in good shape, and we constantly monitor that. What you\u2019re seeing this quarter is really driven by the timing between our SOE opportunities and some of the timing difference between when we\u2019re booking earnings versus the collection of cash. So nothing systemic, and we\u2019ll see that bounce around. So \u2013 but thanks for the question.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning, Mike. How are you?","Mike Harrison","Doing well. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Asia business, and you\u2019ve referenced the short term contract, which I believe also contributed last quarter. But can you just provide some additional detail on how much of that was contributing to revenues in the quarter? And how we should think about that contribution for the rest of fiscal 2020?","Seifi Ghasemi","It is a small contribution that we actually had, but it\u2019s not material and it\u2019s not going to change things that much.","Mike Harrison","All right. And the other question I had is on hydrogen. I believe you mentioned \u2013 you called out strength in the Gulf Coast as well as in Europe. Just wondering if you can provide any sense of what\u2019s driving that? And then it sounds like \u2013 just looking for clarification, it sounds like the turnaround activity was maybe a little bit lower than you expected, but maybe maintenance cost go up in Q2 and net-net about normal in terms of overall maintenance activity for the full year. Is that \u2013 do I understand that correctly?","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes. Number one, I think, as Scott mentioned in his comments that we expect a higher maintenance cost in the second quarter because of the timing. But for the year, we expect our maintenance cost to be what number that we have discussed with you before, which is order of magnitude $250 million, $260 million a year. With respect to hydrogen demand, it is not huge, but we do see some effect because of the IMO 2020 that people need more hydrogen in order to clean up the fuel.","Mike Harrison","All right. Thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","Hi Duffy. How are you?","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thanks. First question is just around the capital. It looks like you\u2019re going to increase your capital spend about 300% per quarter, if you kind of rough the Q4 \u2013 the Q1 number to get to your annual number. What does that end up doing to your tax rate as you shift your geographic footprint over time?","Seifi Ghasemi","I\u2019d like Scott to answer that, but while he is kind of pulling his stats together. And obviously, you know that the reason for that is because we expect a big chunk of capital expenditure because of Jazan when we close. So that is one of the reasons that the number kind of looks, hey, this quarter, it was this, and suddenly, it\u2019s going to go up. That is because of Jazan. In terms of the effect, in terms of our tax, I don\u2019t think it is material, but I\u2019d like Scott to comment on that.","Scott Crocco","Yes, sure. Thanks, Duffy. So as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for the year we expect it still to be in the 20% to 21% book effective tax rate. And obviously, that will move around quarter-to-quarter, be dependent on where \u2013 how much money we make and where we make it. But even going forward on the other side of the Jazan, I would still put it in that sort of range. I will also mention, though, so that\u2019s a book tax rate. From a cash tax perspective, we\u2019ve historically seen in the kind of the mid-teens. And similarly, it depends on where and how much we make. But I would expect it to maybe be the mid-to-upper teens on a cash tax basis, okay?","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thanks. And then in what was resoundingly a good quarter, the most eye-popping number to me was the 10% pricing in the merchant business in Asia. Can you just talk about the supply-demand dynamics? How strong that market feels? And how resilient that kind of pricing momentum feels going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","We feel optimistic about that. You obviously appreciate the nature of the industry, and we don\u2019t want to comment on pricing. So I don\u2019t want to say too much, but we continue to think that there is a good supply-demand situation that, that kind of pricing will continue.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you, guys.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jim Sheehan","Good morning. On your return on capital employed number, a little over 13% and expanding, where do you think that number can get to after some of the very large projects start-up over the next few years?","Seifi Ghasemi","Jim, that\u2019s a good question. We have always said that our target is 15%. So we would like to get it to 15% and I think in time, we will get there. Actually, as we spend more cash, that number will go up because the way we calculate the return, it includes the cash. So if tomorrow, we spent all the cash on projects that number will enhance. Other people don\u2019t include the cash because \u2013 so as a result of that, I mean, you understand the dynamics of the top of the line and the bottom of the line. But fundamentally, we are looking forward to increasing that number to 15%. And Scott has a comment that he wants to add.","Scott Crocco","I just want to build on it and already, if you take a look at our cash on hand, if you were to look at it on a net debt basis, net of the cash, it\u2019s already almost 16% roughly.","Jim Sheehan","Terrific. And on your pricing trends, you\u2019ve been very disciplined about raising prices, and it looks like the supply-demand balance is supporting that. Just curious if you\u2019re starting to see any signs of market share loss as a result of your pricing execution?","Seifi Ghasemi","I don\u2019t want to claim that we have not had any market share loss, but it has not been significant or material, but we might have some. When \u2013 we were very open about this thing in February of last year when we said year when we said that we are \u2013 we need to recover some of our cost as we said before we expect and we are going to \u2013 willing to live with market share loss, but we have not seen a significant one, but there might be some here and there. I don\u2019t want to claim we haven\u2019t lost anything. But it isn\u2019t anything that would force us to change our strategy.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Thank you. If the sequential pricing just rounding down to 0% or is it close to 0.5% or so, so that the year-over-year pricing for the overall company will stay up near 3% over the next few quarters?","Seifi Ghasemi","John, you really do your homework, John. I\u2019m very impressed that you are providing that detail, a lot of credit to you. It is rounding down. It is actually up sequential.","John Roberts","And then if you built a bridge between the December quarter earnings and the March quarter earnings here, you mentioned that the Lunar New Year will be a sequential headwind. Could you talk about sequentially, from an earnings perspective, any other puts and takes as we go from December quarter to March quarter?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, the thing is that when we give you the guidance, obviously, we need to look at everything. And we debated this thing quite a bit yesterday, quite honestly. And that is the dynamic of the Lunar New Year, which we always \u2013 we don\u2019t know exactly how it will work out. And then there is obviously the headline in the papers that you see about this virus thing. So how would that develop and how the effect of that. That is why we decided to take the two into consideration and expand the range. We usually give you guidance within $0.05. This time we are giving you guidance within $0.10. So that is our thinking right now, that\u2019s our best judgment.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard","Hi, good morning guys.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning. How are you?","Jonas Oxgaard","I am great. I was hoping to get some help tying some numbers, is that two-part if you don\u2019t mind. But the first one is, you announced the $500 million project a few weeks ago and I see in your CapEx, you raised it by $500 million, but you had some other announcements in the quarter as well, like the South Korea project. So where did the CapEx from South Korea and others go? Did some projects fall out?","Seifi Ghasemi","No. I don\u2019t think anything has fall out. Simon does these numbers in detail. So Simon, would you like to comment, please.","Simon Moore","Sure. Jonas, sorry if we miscommunicated. I think our CapEx guidance, our expected spending for the year has not changed, quite frankly. You could also expect that when we give you CapEx guidance, it may include projects that haven\u2019t yet been announced but we\u2019re highly confident about. I would also just add the Gulf Coast Ammonia we just announced that there wouldn\u2019t be a huge amount of spending in this fiscal year anyway.","Jonas Oxgaard","Also, I meant that long-term committed to the spend the \u2013 what is it $10.3 billion?","Simon Moore","Sure. So obviously, we continue to spend money on projects that continue to come on stream and so that numbers come up a little bit","Jonas Oxgaard","Yes. But the question is, the number came up $500 million, which is exactly the project you announced in the Gulf Coast, right? Yet there were other announcements in that same quarter that apparently didn\u2019t make it into the sum total.","Seifi Ghasemi","It\u2019s because some of the projects have come on stream, and when they come on stream, they are taken off of the \u2013 off of what we say as backlog.","Simon Moore","And Jonas, I guess, I would just point to the fact that when we give you a backlog number, it may include at times projects that we haven\u2019t announced yet if we\u2019re highly certain of them.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay. That makes sense. The other thing I was trying to tie was the guidance for the year didn\u2019t change even though you beat pretty handily. Is the inference the slipping of Jazan? Or how should I think about that?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, it\u2019s becoming \u2013 we need to put everything together. But obviously, this quarter, our results are better than expectation. We had told you $205 million to $210 million and we delivered $214 million. So as a result, we felt better about our base business, and therefore, but there are \u2013 the timing of the Jazan thing. So at the end of the day, we made the judgment that overall we should be able to meet our commitment.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay. Thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Jonas.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.","Mike Sison","Hey guys. Nice quarter.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thanks, Mike.","Mike Sison","You noted that Lu\u2019An has anniversaried \u2013 I think it\u2019s your first sort of major gasification project. Can you maybe talk about what you\u2019ve learned from running it for a year? Any positive surprises, negative surprises? Obviously, it\u2019s done well. Just kind of wanted your thoughts on how that has done over the last year?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well. Thank you for asking that question because I wanted to brag about it a little bit, quite honestly. We have had a very positive experience. Number one, our expectation of the amount of time that we can keep the project online when we started and people will tell you gasifiers or something like 85%, 86%, we have had those gasifiers online for more than 95% of the time. So that is very good news. The second thing is that in terms of financial performance is exactly as we thought. And the third thing is that we have learned a lot by operating these shared gasifiers first hand. And we are seeing some positive impacts that we will incorporate in the future projects. And I\u2019m also very proud of our people that we gave them this and we had to put in something like 500 new people on this thing. We have operated this thing, knocking on board very safely and very efficiently. So it has been a very positive experience, and it significantly has increased our confidence in taking on new projects.","Mike Sison","Got it. Thank you. And then just one quick one on the range for the year. Just curious, at the high end, what do you think needs to happen to sort of be close to that end versus sort of the midpoint or the lower end?","Seifi Ghasemi","We need to get lucky with the economy and close Jazan in time, so.","Mike Sison","Okay. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","Yes. Seifi, if a partner were to come to you and offer you either an excess supply of energy or maybe a renewable energy supply, do you have the capability of producing hydrogen from electrolysis?","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes, we do. And we already do that. We have the capability and we are pursuing projects in that \u2013 of that nature.","Steve Byrne","And when you look out longer-term, Seifi, in your \u2013 in this pursuit of hydrogen for transportation, how would you rank that technology versus the standard of methane reforming versus this more recent project with using ammonia as a carrier of hydrogen?","Seifi Ghasemi","I think that the world is moving toward green hydrogen. And green hydrogen is obviously using solar and then electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen. We think that is the future and a significant number of projects will be done in that way. And that is where we are building our capability. You are very right, that is the future. We definitely think that is the future. Yes, ammonia thing is obviously a special issue, which is transportation of hydrogen. But you should think that people would use solar in order to make green hydrogen and then take that green hydrogen converted to ammonia and then send it to Japan.","Steve Byrne","And with respect to carbon sequestration, is that Gulf Coast Ammonia project of yours have any requirements on you to sequester the CO2?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, not the Gulf Coast. We got the permit \u2013 we are not recovering CO2 at that plant at this time.","Steve Byrne","Yes, I was really referring to the long-term contracts for this ammonia. Is there any component of that that is expecting that the carbon to be sequestered?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, there is no such requirement.","Steve Byrne","Okay. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning, guys. Two quick ones. Can you help us with the effective tailwind for next year from the projects that are lapping next year and then the new projects coming on, just so we can get a sense for how much of a deceleration compared to this year is implied by the backlog? And secondly, on carbon sequestration, I think a lot of the environmental debate focuses on the relative cost versus mitigation coming out at about 5 times to 10 times the cost of mitigating through, for example, tree planting.","But obviously, carbon sequestration has the virtue that is a project you control. Can you give us a sense for how you\u2019re thinking about sequestration versus mitigation? And how quickly you can bring down the cost of the sequestration technology?","Seifi Ghasemi","I think all of these questions that you\u2019re asking in terms of the carbon capture and so on depends on the location that we are \u2013 you are and which part of the world you are and what are the incentives and all of that. So it will be difficult to give you a general answer. With respect to your first question, with respect to \u2013 I do not see any drag on our results next year as a result of the project. So I\u2019m not sure I fully understood your question. We expect that for 2021 our EPS will grow another 10% versus 2020. We don\u2019t expect any deceleration.","Laurence Alexander","Okay, great.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you very much. With that, I think that was the last question that people have signed up for. So I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your very busiest schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. In the meantime, have a great day, and have a nice quarter and expect some good results from Air Products when we announce our results next quarter. Thanks, again. Have a nice day.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"383":["Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Simon Moore","Thank you, Dede. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2016 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release.","Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.","First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President responsible for industrial gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President in charge of our material technologies business. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions.","I am very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite significant global macro uncertainty and currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on our five-point plan and delivered earnings of $1.78 per share, which is up 15% over last year. Another quarter of outstanding performance is due to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees around the globe. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward so that we can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal.","However, I am disappointed with one aspect of our performance. Please turn to slide number 3. Our safety performance this quarter was worse than previous years and, therefore, it is not acceptable. Our goal includes being the safest industrial gas company in the world. We have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure everyone goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee and I have made it very clear to everyone that our safety performance must improve.","Now please turn to slide number 4, which is the restatement of our goal. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side and I'm confident we will refocus and improve our performance on the safety side.","Now please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long-term is the increase in per-share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most responsible -- most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.","Now please turn to slide number 6, our strategic plan as we move forward. Our strong performance this quarter is a direct result of the focus on our five-point plan that we discussed and disclosed more than a year ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter, but wanted to make a few more comments. The first point in our plan is to focus on industrial gases, our core business.","In September of 2015, we announced plans to spin off our material technologies business tax free to our U.S. shareholders and set it up as a separate standalone public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form-10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work to prepare for this spin. Most importantly, Guillermo and the material technology team are delivering very strong performance. We remain confident this transaction will be complete before September of 2016.","The fourth point of our plan was the responsible use of cash and controlling our cost. In this area, we have made excellent progress. We had a very robust and detailed process for reviewing every capital investment of more than $3 million at the corporate level and we have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects.","We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue, and earnings growth over the next few years. In the area of cost savings, we have reduced our overhead costs by $300 million per year already and have a detailed plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational cost savings in the next four years. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million.","Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward so then we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.","Now please turn to slide number 7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details later, but I want to emphasize that the improved EBITDA margin by 500 basis points increased free cash by $200 million, increased our earnings per share by 15% and return on capital employed is up 160 basis points to 11.7%. This is despite a weak worldwide economy, lower sales and a $0.08 negative impact from currency exchange translation.","And now if you please turn to slide number 8, which by the way is my favorite slide. You will see our progress over the last two years where we have improved our margins by more than 800 basis points. We are determined to continue to improve our margins.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss our quarterly results. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you very much, Seifi.","Please turn to slide 9 for a review of our Q1 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 8% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 5% each. Volumes increased 1% as Gases Asia growth continued, while Material Technologies and Gases Americas and Gases Europe volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later.","Pricing was 1% higher for the fifth consecutive quarter, again driven by price increases in Gases Americas and Gases Europe and both price increases and mix in Material Technologies. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $786 million improved by 9% and operating income improved by 17% despite the lower sales.","EBITDA margin improved 520 basis points to 33.4%, while operating margin improved 460 basis points to 22%. We saw margin improvements across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 60 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 400 basis points resulted primarily from lower costs and higher prices. Our actions continued to show results and this quarter is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years versus prior year net income and earnings per share grew 15%. And we continued to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 160 basis points to 11.7%.","Now please turn to slide 10. You have heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by $88 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA and slightly lower maintenance capital. We remain focused on spending the right amount of maintenance capital at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. As a result of lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $165 million this quarter, or $199 million higher than prior year. That's a great start to fiscal 2016.","We expect growth CapEx for FY16 to be lower than our initial guidance, primarily due to the decision last quarter to suspend construction on the Tees Valley II projects. Please remember that, from a timing perspective, it's not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.","Turning to slide number 11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance, I would like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.11 per share or $26 million pretax. Back in November, we announced that we were suspending construction of Tees Valley II until certain design issues of Tees Valley I are better understood and can be integrated into the design of Tees Valley II.","In fiscal Q1, we incurred incremental costs of $14 million, or $0.05 per share, to suspend construction activities of the second project. We expect about another $0.02 of additional costs to be incurred in the second quarter.","We also saw Materials Technology separation costs of $12 million, or $0.06 per share, for legal and advisory fees. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements.","With the completion of our first phase, restructuring costs were modest this quarter and are included in our underlying results. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.78 increased $0.23 per share, or 15%, versus last year despite the currency headwinds.","Volumes increased EPS by $0.02 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.14. Net cost performance was $0.18 favorable, primarily due to the benefit from our actions taken last year to enable a new, more disciplined organization.","Cost performance also included about a $0.03 benefit from lower pension costs. Unfavorable currency was $0.08 per share as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for Gases our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Equity affiliate income was $0.03 unfavorable. Interest expense was $0.02 lower due to higher capitalized interest and the retirement of higher-cost Indura debt last quarter.","Taxes were $0.03 unfavorable due to higher earnings and timing of a few items. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely closer to 25%. Non-controlling interest was $0.02 favorable, due to our buy up of the remaining shares of the Indura business last quarter. And higher shares outstanding reduced EPS by $0.01.","Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I will turn the call over to Corning.","Corning Painter","Thanks, Scott.","First, I would like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team for another very strong quarter and step up in our margins. Despite currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions just about everywhere, we improved overall EBITDA margin by 450 basis points year-on-year.","Going forward, we're going to drive operational productivity to new heights at Air Products and we are going to work tirelessly to improve safety.","In our highly-distributed business, we often describe operational productivity as 10,000 little things. That means we have many opportunities to act and our new, simpler organization is helping us to act with speed. For example, we used to have a bias to purchase on corporate global, sole-source agreements. And that's a good strategy for some things, but not everything.","In our new organization an empowered regional team broke this paradigm. They decided to multi-source. That meant we could introduce low-cost local suppliers and we could select the best supplier for each location. Our other regions are replicating this and we would expect savings in the 40% range.","We are also improving distribution routing and fleet efficiency by working with third parties that bring new ideas. We are improving operating and maintenance efficiency by using our data to adjust maintenance intervals and improving network efficiency by consolidating facilities. These are some of the 10,000 things.","With that, please turn to slide 12 for a review of our Gases Americas first quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on cost drove the margin expansion. Sales of $836 million were down 17% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 12% and currency reduced sales by 4%.","Volumes were down 3% on weakness in Latin America and in the North America steel and oilfield services markets. Some steel customers idled capacity in December, which will have some impact on argon and oxygen volumes going forward. HyCO volumes and refinery operating rates remained strong. Pricing was up 2%, the fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas. We had particular success in South America in several specific products. Helium has been a strength for us, but oversupply in helium will likely begin to weaken pricing later this year. We expect the helium market to tighten again in a few years.","Operating income of $212 million was flat to last year and EBITDA of $335 million was up 1% as we overcame the headwinds from currency, lower energy pass through and lower volumes through pricing, the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs.","Record operating margins of 25.3% was up 420 basis points and record EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 700 basis points. The impact from lower energy pass-through was about half of the margin improvement. Lower costs drove our sequential profit and margin improvement.","We expect volume weakness to continue in Q2, particularly for steel in Latin America, but expect our cost focus will overcome higher major maintenance costs and drive improved profitability versus last year.","Now please turn to slide 13. For Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses we saw the benefit of our cost restructuring actions as EBITDA and operating margins set new records, both up almost 500 basis points versus last year, sales of $438 million were down 12% due to a negative currency impact of 10% primarily due to the euro, pound and Polish zloty and a negative 2% impact on lower energy pass-through.","Underlying sales were flat with 1% lower volumes and 1% higher prices. Positive liquid bulk volumes were more than offset by lower package gases volumes, in part due to weak offshore demand and by lower refinery hydrogen demand. Price was positive across all sub-regions.","Operating income of $92 million was up 13% and operating margin of 20.9% was up 470 basis points. Operating income would have been up 22% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA of $146 million was up 2% and EBITDA margin of 33.3% was up 480 basis points. The primary driver of improved profitability was our continued focus on costs and the positive contribution from our pricing actions.","Please turn to slide 14, Gases Asia. As you can see from our results, our business performance was very strong again this quarter with record operating and EBITDA margins. Despite all the talk about China, we did well in China. Of course, we expect our China tonnage volumes to be up with the new plants on stream, but merchant volumes were up also again. We remain cautious about the economic outlook in Asia but are pleased with the resilience our business has demonstrated.","Sales of $413 million was up 4%, primarily driven by volumes up 11%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily from Korea, Taiwan and China. Overall, merchant volumes were up low double digits again across Asia, with China LOX\/LIN volumes also up low double digits. We were pleased to fully bring on-stream the largest ASU project that Air Products has ever built, providing oxygen to Yankuang in Yulin, China. We now have six large oxygen for coal gasification projects on stream in China including over 20,000 tons a day of oxygen added this last year. Our customers are operating their facilities, our plants are running well, and we are getting paid.","As I have mentioned in the past, we do occasionally see swings in the energy pass-through around customer startups. This has no impact on profit, but can impact sales and margins. Sequentially, volumes were down 3%, in part due to a positive catch-up payment in Q4 that I mentioned last quarter. Pricing was down 2% on the continued overcapacity in the China liquid market.","Operating income of $117 million was up 29% and operating margin of 28.2% was up 550 basis points. EBITDA of $180 million was up 16% and EBITDA margin of 43.6% was up 480 basis points. Profit improvement was driven by the base business volume growth, new projects successfully coming on-stream and the benefit of our cost reduction programs and about $5 million of non-recurring items. The team is very focused on continuing to drive improvement, but we would expect some volume weakness from the Lunar New Year next quarter.","I will close with a comment on Global Gases segment. You will recall that this is the segment that includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as costs associated with the industrial gas business which are not region specific. Sales were up as we began to recognize revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales.","Now, I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.","Guillermo Novo","Thank you, Corning.","Please turn to slide 15. Let me start with a few general comments before I go into the numbers. In September of last year, Air Products announced its intention to separate Materials Technologies business through a spin-off to our shareholders. This strategic decision will allow Materials Technologies and Air Products Industrial Gases to leverage our respective strengths and will enable better business performance for both companies over the long-term. The new company will be called Versum Materials and will be highly profitable with strong cash flow generation and solid growth prospects.","Our team is very excited about this tremendous opportunity and as you can see from our strong results, we remain focused on executing our strategy while driving safety, business improvement and taking care of our customers.","We are also making good progress on key steps required to enable the spin-off, which we expect to be completed before September of 2016. For example, in December we submitted the initial draft of our Form-10. On February 24, George Bitto, Versum's future CFO, Simon, and I plan to host a conference call to help you understand our business including our key markets, products, as well as our plans for future success.","Given the progress we have made in the spin-off process and the level of financial information we have provided, you will see we are sharing more details about our business. I will first make a few comments on our overall Materials Technologies segment and then make more specific comments on Electronic Materials and Performance Materials results for the quarter.","Segment sales of $490 million were down 6% versus last year, including a negative 2% currency impact. As a reminder, for Materials Technologies, currency volatility has a greater impact on our business than on the industrial gas business of Air Products. Given the global nature of our supply network, we have both translational and transactional impact from currency. More so for Performance Materials, where North America supplies a significant portion of our demand in Europe and Latin America.","Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems in Electronics and lower demand in Performance Materials. Pricing was up 2%. EBITDA of $147 million was up 14% and EBITDA margins were up 530 basis points. Operating income of $127 million was up 22% and operating margins of 26% was up 600 basis points another record margin quarter driven by cost-reduction actions and the management of price versus raw materials. Most importantly, we bounced back very well from a softer fourth quarter.","As I told you last quarter, we expect to improve our profitability and deliver higher profits in 2016 than we did in 2015 and we're still committed to this. We are off to a great start in the first quarter, but are somewhat cautious of the second quarter given the decline in the delivery systems activity that I mentioned before. And the weak macroeconomic environment impacting demand, continued currency headwinds and the impact of lower material costs on our inventories. But as you know, the second half of the year is typically the stronger part of the year for our business.","On slide 16, you can see the results of Electronic Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 4% on lower volumes, improved pricing and mix and negative currency effect. As expected, delivery system activity was down significantly. Despite key products in our PM portfolio being capacity constrained, our overall Materials volumes were flat as we continue to see strong demand in advanced materials business. That is a great example of innovation that continues to be at the core of our organic growth and of the future products and solutions for our customers.","For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $96 million was up 27% and EBITDA margins of 39.2% was up almost 1,000 basis points. Operating income of $83 million was up 43% and margins of $33.9 million was up over 1,000 basis points. Pricing and mix and the benefit of our cost-reduction actions were the key drivers. The quarter also benefited from the timing impact of portfolio actions we have taken. These are worth about 200 basis points. The rest of the 800 basis point improvement is from underlying business performance.","On slide 17 you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 9% on lower volumes, lower prices and negative currency effect. Volumes were down in epoxy and additives business, driven by weak global demand in general and in particular, weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. This includes a specific customer shutdown in Brazil. Prices were down, but were more than offset by lower material costs.","Performance Materials EBITDA of $51 million was down 7%, but margins of 20.9% was up 50 basis points. Operating income of $44 million was down 7%, but margins of 18% was up 30 basis points. The lower volumes and the negative impact of currency more than offset the benefits of pricing relative to raw materials and the cost-reduction actions.","On slide 18, you can see the trailing 12-month results for Materials Technologies segment. Sales of just over $2 billion, EBITDA of $590 million with margins of 28.7% and operating income of almost $500 million with margins of 24.3%. This is as reported within Air Products and does not include any allocated corporate costs. As you can see, Versum Materials will be a very high-quality company with very attractive margins.","Slide 19 shows the operating margin improvement in Materials Technologies over the last three years. Although recent market dynamics have been favorable for a few products, the overall performance was not driven by a cyclical peak as the business environment varied significantly over this period of time. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts over the last three years: innovation focusing on our key product and markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions. While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven in part by macroeconomic drivers, we do not see this as a cyclical business. The semiconductor industry has changed and the underlying improvements we have made in process materials is sustainable.","As I indicated in the past, we are capacity constrained in several product lines and we are launching several new products in advanced materials, all of which require us to expand capacity. We continued to make good progress on the capital projects I talked about in our last two earnings calls. As you saw from the initial draft Form-10, the spending on these expansion projects increased total CapEx to about $100 million in fiscal year 2015.","We expect fiscal year 2016 CapEx to be about $200 million before it drops back down to more typical levels of below $100 million for fiscal year 2017. Keep in mind that we only make these types of large capital investments every few years. In fact, the last one was eight years ago. As I said, Versum will generate very strong cash flows.","We are executing and remain focused on our key priorities, safety, top-line growth, and margin enhancement and equally important, we are committed to meeting or exceeding our timeline for the spin-off of Materials Technologies business as a standalone company. I know that I can speak for the entire team that we are committing to adding value to our customers, to the success of the business and to creating an exciting and profitable future for our shareholders and the rest of our stakeholders. Again, I look forward to sharing more information with you on our call on February 24.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Simon for quick comments on the corporate segment.","Simon Moore","Thanks, Guillermo.","Our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container business, as well as corporate costs which are not business specific. Sales were flat versus last year as higher LNG sales were offset by lower helium container sales. The LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations this quarter. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY'16 results. The improved profitability this quarter was primarily driven by the higher LNG activity and the benefit of reduced corporate costs.","Now I will turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you again, Simon.","Now please turn to slide number 20 for a discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team is focused on the things we can control toward our goal of becoming the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.83. At midpoint this will be an increase of $0.26, or 16%, over the second quarter of last year and will represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth.","Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background and increased currency headwinds, we are confident in delivering on and are maintaining our full-year fiscal year 2016 guidance of $7.25 to $7.50 per share. At midpoint this will be a 12% increase over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance. The full-year and quarterly guidance includes the Materials Technologies business as part of Air Products for the full 2016.","Primarily as a result of our decision to suspend construction of Tees Valley II project, we now expect our CapEx to be about $1.3 billion for the year, down about 25% from fiscal year 2015. As you can see from our results, we improved free cash flow by $200 million this quarter. You have heard me talk about priorities for the use of cash we generate and I would like to reiterate them in the order of priority.","Our number one priority is to maintain an A credit rating. Number two, we will use our cash to invest in good projects and good and accretive acquisitions. Number three, we will continue to increase our dividends. And number four, finally, if and only if, there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. The cash we generate belongs to the shareholders and we only spend our cash if we have enough high-return projects and acquisitions. Otherwise, as I have said, we would return it to our shareholders.","Air Products growth into the future will not be driven by any single large event. I am confident we will deliver on our commitment to spin Material Technologies and we will resolve our Energy from Waste business in Northern England. Our future growth and profit growth will be driven by executing on the basics of our industrial gas business that is we will focus on all aspects of growth in our industrial gases.","We will deliver the second $300 million of cost savings over the next few years, enabled by the more focused and accountable organization we already have in place. We will deliver on projects in our backlog and we will compete for and win new projects at high return. We certainly understand there is significant uncertainty in the world today, but we are focused on the things we control to drive improvement. We believe in self-help regardless of the external environment.","The future is very bright for Industrial Gases business in general and most importantly, for Air Products. We do have an outstanding team of talented, dedicated and motivated people who are driving change and we are blessed with having a great portfolio of businesses around the world with more than 170,000 outstanding customers to serve. I'm very proud of our people, incredibly optimistic about the future of Air Products and consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team.","We are now delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mr. Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Chris Evans","Good morning, everybody. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was wondering if your increasing free cash flow position changes your appetite for share repurchases going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I've just been through our priorities in terms of what we will do with the free cash. As I said, we are going to maintain our A rating. We are already there. So we don't need to spend more cash to do that. And then I said that we are going to invest in new projects. We of a lot of new projects in place and a lot of future ones that will require cash. We are focused on making good acquisitions and there are plenty of opportunities to take a look at that, but -- and we want to increase our dividend. Now after that, if we still have cash left, yes, we will buy shares, but as I said, please just take a look at our order of priorities.","Chris Evans","I would ask you then if the credit market environment, if that changes any of your thoughts about the MT spin or your expectations for what your interest expense is going to be there.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, we have said that we are going to spin Material Technologies by September of 2016. So I understand that there are difficulties right now with the credit markets and the stock market in general, but we are not about to spin Material Technologies next week or next month. So we are obviously going to monitor what is going on in the world and when the time comes, we will take everything into consideration about what we want to do.","Chris Evans","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning, David. How are you?","David Begleiter","Very good. Thank you. Seifi, on pricing, trends remain positive. What's your view on potentially -- should they remain positive for the full year? And what's the potential for these trends to actually increase or accelerate going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","As I said, we are optimistic about our future. We have given you a forecast for the year, which is -- has a wide range on it, $7.25 to $7.50. So we obviously -- our goal is to make the $7.50 not the $7.25. And our self-help projects are actually delivering results. That's why we were able to beat the guidance for the first quarter, because our cost savings delivered more than what we expected. So we do remain positive.","David Begleiter","Just one more thing, Seifi. Given the combination of Air Liquide and Air Gas, can you discuss any threats or opportunities that combination might present to you in the short term or longer term?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, David, that's an interesting question and I'm at a loss about how to respond to that without hurting anybody's feelings on either side. But fundamentally, as we had always said, Airgas was not a strategic acquisition for us. We never thought it was. At the end of the day, if you take our industrial gas sales of about $8 billion, the overlap with Airgas is only about $1.5 billion, if you exclude our HyCO business and our business in Europe and Asia. So it was never a strategic thing.","We don't feel that we have lost anything, but by -- there are other people going and paying an arm and a leg to buy the business. So we have to wait and see how it develops, but we certainly are focused on taking advantage of any opportunity that may arise.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, David.","Scott Crocco","Thanks David.","Operator","Next, we will go to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","Hi. I was just wondering, out of your plants in China that are in coal gasification operations, what end-markets are you most levered to? Is it polyethylene, ammonia, methanol? Some of those are not doing very well. And is the profitability of your take-or-pay contracts -- is affected by operating rates?","Seifi Ghasemi","First of all, as you know the nature of our business, our supply contracts have a fixed monthly charge. It is not dependent on the profitability of the customer. So whether those markets are up or down doesn't really affect our monthly fee that we get. The second thing is that most of our exposure is to coal to liquids and we don't have a lot of exposure to methanol and all of that. But I would like Corning to expand on this.","Corning Painter","I think the key thing here is they are all operating. These are plants with high fixed costs, low operating costs. We have a mix of end-markets that it goes into. We've got strong contract coverage and you can see the impact in our results. It's quite a positive for us.","Steve Byrne","But you do have an effect on operating rate? It does -- beyond the monthly fee?","Seifi Ghasemi","No, it doesn't.","Corning Painter","No, no.","Seifi Ghasemi","It doesn't. It's a fixed price. Whether a customer operates at 70%, 50%, or 90%, we get the same fee.","Steve Byrne","Okay, thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning P.J. How are you doing this morning?","P.J. Juvekar","I'm doing well. In Asia your volumes are up nicely, 11%. How much of that was base business and how much of that was any new plant start-ups that you had?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I'd like to have Corning answer that.","Corning Painter","Right. So thank you for the question. A little more than half of that is the new plant startups, and we all expect that and so forth. But nearly half of that step up is the base business, including in China, so I really think that's tremendous and speaks a lot about the resilience of the business we have there.","P.J. Juvekar","With oil prices near $30 are you seeing any project delays or cancellations in energy end-markets? I noticed that you dropped your CapEx guidance. Is that because you're going after high-return projects or is that because there is not a growth -- lack of growth opportunities or sort of combination of both?","Seifi Ghasemi","P.J., we have not seen any cancellations of the projects that we are working on. We have dropped CapEx because -- primarily because we have stopped spending money on Tees Valley II. That expenditure, P.J., was at the rate of more than $20 million a month. So that is where the saving is coming from.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, sir.","Corning Painter","Thanks P.J.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning.","Jeff Zekauskas","Can you talk about your backlog in LNG and how much risk you think is in the business this year if you think there is risk in it?","Seifi Ghasemi","There is no risk on the business this year. The projects that we are working on are -- have not been canceled, Jeff. I think we said that at the -- Simon said that in his comments.","Jeff Zekauskas","Sure.","Seifi Ghasemi","We haven't seen any cancellation. The issue that we have is for the future projects that we were counting on, on the years to come. Those projects have been put on hold. None of them have been canceled, but they have been put on hold. So that's the part that we have to see but this year we are not at risk at all.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, for my follow-up, if you look at your industrial gas demand in Europe and in the United States, it seems to be somewhat below GDP growth. And there are all kinds of reasons why there are pressures on the industrial gas business. Has the sort of the makeup of your customer base changed so much that it's difficult for industrial gas to grow at a GDP rate now or do you see this as merely cyclical?","Seifi Ghasemi","Look, Jeff, on that one I will you an answer and then I will allow Corning to expand on that.","Jeff Zekauskas","Sure.","Seifi Ghasemi","I mean, you know, very well that the GDP in the United States, 70% of that GDP is discretionary consumer spendings. The industrial production, which our sales are related to, that one is not growing as much. So our correlation of our sales has always been with industrial production. So as a result of that, we don't see any change in our customer mix to make us believe that we will have lower growth rates as compared to the past. But, Corning, you want to make any comment?","Corning Painter","Maybe just one other insight I can add to that. I think we're in a market situation where it's maybe a little less likely to make -- useful to look at a broad, sweeping statement about a market -- Europe, North America, China in that different segments within each industrial economy are doing better and worse and have very different approaches. Even in steel you could say, well, there's overcapacity. It is impacted by lower oil, but automotive demand is quite strong. So I think we are sort of in a spiky market where some specific end-markets do better and worse than others.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning, everyone.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning.","Vincent Andrews","The comments you made on the Americas pricing, it sounded like you saw solid pricing in South America. I'm just wondering how much of that was sort of trying to recover currency and was that ultimately offsetting negative pricing in the United States or what's the trend as you move across the different sub geographies of the Americas?","Seifi Ghasemi","Sure, Corning?","Corning Painter","Maybe the best way to get to this question of underlying cost versus pricing is we had margin expansion, let's say from the mix of that, in both regions. Does that answer your question?","Vincent Andrews","Yes. That answers my question. Then just as a follow-up. Do you have an update on Tees Valley I to share with us?","Seifi Ghasemi","Not really, Vincent. What we have been doing with Tees Valley I is for the past year we start the plant up, learn something; the plant goes down because something goes wrong. So we're in an iterative process of trying to learn how the gasifier behaves and if we can make it work on a sustainable basis. There is a still significant outstanding question about if we will ever be able to get it to work on a sustainable basis. And as I said, we have given ourselves a few months to keep trying it, but there will come a time that we might stop trying. The technology is proving to be a lot more difficult than people thought at the beginning and I have to say we haven't made a lot of significant progress since we talked to you last time.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thank very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And next we have John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Good morning, nice quarter.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thanks John.","John Roberts","Corning, was most of the 2% price increase in the Americas in South America? It sounded like you made a comment like that. And so we should think about that as recovering currency?","Corning Painter","We had pricing success in both North and South America. If I were going to lay this all back to underlying what's behind it, I would say, as much as anything, it is good service, which gets you the right to raise their price, combined with good discipline. Obviously, power rates and other inputs are a factor to it, but particularly to the comments I made before about margin, I think it comes down to discipline and service.","John Roberts","And then, secondly, do you still expect Versum to be as leveraged as you originally thought? Rates for higher debt companies have gone up, so I was wondering whether you are rethinking that.","Seifi Ghasemi","We will decide that finally about, quite honestly, two weeks before we actually go public and raise the debt. The markets, as you know better than I do, change just about almost on a weekly basis. So right now we have no reason to believe that we shouldn't be able to do what we have suggested before. But obviously in a few months, when we are actually going to do that, we will consult with our advisors who are already working on it and decide what is the appropriate number to put in there.","We certainly, as we've always said, we are determined to set up Versum for success and we will not load it up with leverage that is inappropriate or load them up with significant interest charges that they cannot afford. But the company, as Guillermo has been explaining to you, they are doing very well and their capacity for debt is significantly even more than what we have suggested no matter what the markets. But we will make that decision right before we actually do it.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And next we have Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Harrison","Hi. Good morning.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Harrison","Guillermo, I was wondering if you could talk about the big decline in delivery systems within Electronic Materials. Should we view that as a negative leading indicator, or can you maybe give us some color on what that suggests about the overall health of the electronics market? And also maybe comment, was there any tailwind from inventory revaluation in the quarter?","Guillermo Novo","First, let me talk on the delivery systems. Actually nothing we've said is new. I think in the last two calls we already predicted that this -- the delivery systems, the equipment business was going to be slowing down versus prior year, a lot of it was because of some projects that we did last year. So our delta was probably more driven from that project differential.","Now if you look at a lot of the projections and this has been how the actual demand has been tracking from a lot of the third party industry -- the projection was for a softening in CapEx that would start to pick up in the back end of 2016. And we are still tracking that. So it hasn't been a big surprise for us.","Regarding the inventory reval, this is why I'm a little bit more cautious for the second quarter. Not that we are seeing a big change in dynamics versus what we've projected in the past, but in the near-term the headwinds of currency, oil price deflation and the impact it's having on our price so we should have some inventory reval. But also on the demand side, a lot of our customers -- unlike gases, we have inventory; our customers have inventory. And some of the demand softness that we are seeing is just people taking actions on their inventory levels.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then, you guys commented that refinery hydrogen volumes in EMEA were lower. Can you give some additional details on that? Were there some shutdowns or what's going on?","Guillermo Novo","Well, we did have a steam methane reformer that we shut down last year, but if I were going to say sequentially I think it's just a shift to slightly sweeter feedstock taking place there right now.","Mike Harrison","All right, thank you very much.","Guillermo Novo","Thanks Mike.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils Wallin","Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First off on Jazan, it looks the timing might have been pushed out a little bit, yet you are booking revenues now. So is there anything that is new or that you can update us on, on that project?","Seifi Ghasemi","First of all, we are not aware of anything being pushed out. The project is on schedule and Saudi Aramco is actually pushing us to complete the project on time. So we haven't had any delays on that. No, we are executing with great speed on that.","Nils Wallin","Understood. And just with respect to the LOX\/LIN market in China, certainly there's been some talk about steel closures in some of the Chinese producers. Do you think that will affect overall LOX\/LIN volumes or there will be no change there?","Seifi Ghasemi","I'll have Corning to comment on that.","Corning Painter","First of all, the results that we reported today reflect everything that has happened to-date. I think the question of what's going to happen in steel is interesting. Many of those steel mills have their own captive air separation plant. Many of them sell that onto the market and if those were to close, that would be an interesting impact and might take some capacity out.","Nils Wallin","Got it. Thanks very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Duffy Fisher with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Hey, good morning, fellows.","Seifi Ghasemi","Hi. Good morning, Duffy. How are you?","Duffy Fischer","Good. Thanks. Maybe first one for Scott, on the cost programs, which have been very successful so far, the first $300 million is kind of $75 million run rate per quarter. Did we see all of that impacting the first quarter?","And then, when this year will we anniversary or when do you think we will anniversary that first $300 million? And then, on the second $300 million over four years, you would think about that as being $75 million per year. Is it back-end loaded, front-end loaded? How should we think about that rolling through?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, first of all, on the $300 million, we did see the $75 million savings in the first quarter. And on the second thing, we have said $75 million a year, but we are beginning -- starting that beginning of 2016, so we expect to deliver about half of that in 2016. So in our forecast, we have about $35 million, $36 million of additional savings in 2016, but then in 2017 we should have the whole $75 million.","Duffy Fischer","Okay, understood. Great. Then just a follow-up on the China situation. You guys were reporting good volumes there or improving volumes. How long do you think that needs to continue before that market starts to get healthy? I know, Seifi, you've talked about it being massively oversupplied. I mean, is it a six-quarter issue? Is it a 12-quarter issue? How long before that market can start to get healthy?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, it's obviously going to take a while because, as you know, the overcapacity, the installed capacity is about 55,000 and the demand is about 27,000 tons a day. But the shutdown of some of these older steel plants will help. Obviously, China is growing, so whether it will take another three years, another four years, or another five years is debatable. Anyway, that's my view. I'll have Corning to kind of comment on that too.","Corning Painter","I think we talk a lot focusing on what we control and we don't really fully control that marketplace and I really hesitate to guess how that's all going to be. But I think what matters for us is continuing to drive our retail sales, which sequentially are up again for us, working with end-use customers, continuing to load the capacity that we have in the ground and we are highly focused on that.","Duffy Fischer","Terrific. Thank you, guys.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","Jim Sheehan","Good morning, Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Good morning.","Jim Sheehan","You guys gave some good commentary on the Asia market and then China. Was wondering if you could also give us an update on what merchant utilization rates look like in the other regions and what your outlook is in each one.","Seifi Ghasemi","Sure. Corning will be happy to do that.","Corning Painter","Our utilization really runs in the 70s and a little bit lower, I guess, I would say, in South America right now. And I think we see ourselves continuing to operate in that range.","Jim Sheehan","And Europe?","Corning Painter","So I'm speaking for Europe as well. Europe would be in the 70s as well.","Jim Sheehan","Great. And in terms of your cash from operations outlook in 2016, how much growth are you expecting?","Seifi Ghasemi","When you say cash from operations, do you mean free cash flow? Well, we did about $200 million in the first quarter, so I'm hoping that that trend to continue, but I'm not suggesting we will have $800 million of free cash. But we might. I mean it depends on the project. It depends on how much money we spend on the new projects that are coming on stream, but we feel pretty good about significant free cash generation. Scott, you want to make any additional comments?","Scott Crocco","Sure, just to build on it. As I've said in the past, we're focused on generating as much cash as we can from our existing assets. That's the EBITDA. And then, as Seifi mentioned, going through our cash flow priorities, recognizing where to spend the right amount of money on the maintenance capital. And so we feel good about where we are. We are going to continue to focus on cash. Again, generating from the assets we have in the ground and then making sure that we are very disciplined in how we deploy that capital.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David Manthey","Hey, guys. Good morning. Seifi, in response to a previous question about the current global situation, I'm wondering if you can just help us understand, do you view the recent changes in global industrial demand, in energy and emerging markets, do you view that as cyclical or secular? And are there any implications on your growth strategy as you go forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","Quite honestly, we haven't seen anything earth-shattering change in the last quarter since we talked to you last time. Obviously, as you know better than I do, it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen, but right now we don't have any reason to be pessimistic about growth opportunities for industrial gases. I have always said that I have a little bit of a different point of view from my colleagues. I see a lot of opportunities for us to engage in new projects. We have engaged in new projects and we have been able to win projects that were north of 10% return.","So we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities for growth in different sectors around the world, especially U.S. Gulf Coast and obviously China in terms of bigger projects. We are focused on those. We have opportunities in the Middle East that we are working on. So I don't have any reason to be really pessimistic about the future of the industrial gases in general. Specifically, in terms of the liquid market in the different parts of the world, a little bit up, a little bit down, but nothing has really changed since we talked to you last time to make us more optimistic or less optimistic.","David Manthey","Okay. Thanks for taking the question.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have a question from Mike Sison from KeyBanc.","Mike Sison","Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Seifi Ghasemi","Hi, Mike.","Mike Sison","A couple of quick ones on Versum. What type of growth, earnings growth do you expect to see this year? And could you give us kind of how to think about that business over the next three to five years?","Seifi Ghasemi","Guillermo, will be happy to answer that. Whatever he says is not enough, we should do more than that, but go ahead.","Guillermo Novo","We are continuing to see good progress. I mean the core driver of our business, at the end of the day, is innovation and how we are playing in the different segments of the businesses that we are in, both in electronics and performance materials. So we are very bullish. We see the longer-term trends on mobility continue to grow, especially towards the back end of the year, environmental drivers, performance drivers that are driving our PMD business.","So we said that we expect to grow at 1.5x to 2x GDP and we are still comfortable with that long-term outlook. Obviously, in the near term we have a little bit more fluctuation based on what's happening with the base business and that's more linked to GDP growth and global demand.","Mike Sison","Okay, great. Quick follow-up, in terms of the capacity expansions for advanced materials, do you have customers lined up for that? And how much growth does that support for you over the next couple years?","Guillermo Novo","If you look at our materials business, this is very different from the gases where it's more project oriented, you build it and then you sell it out. For us, we sell it out, we develop the products, we develop markets and then we built the capacity to support our long-term growth. So we don't look at it as we're going to start this plant and generate new business. We will reload our entire network and that will give us opportunities not only to support new volume growth, but optimize our cost structure, our supply chain and our productivity across the network.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Guillermo. We are well past the one hour usually allocated, so we will take one more question, please.","Operator","And the final question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Emily Wagner","Good morning. This is actually Emily Wagner on for Don Carson.","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes. Good morning.","Emily Wagner","Good morning. We just had a few questions on EMEA. Do you think you could break down the 470 basis points operating margin improvement from restructuring versus lower energy pass-through?","Scott Crocco","So, I think we are going to scramble to do that in the moment, but I would say the energy pass-through is a much smaller portion there than what we see in North America.","Seifi Ghasemi","Yes. For the exact, exact number, obviously -- I would say -- I don't have the exact number to quote you, but I can confidently say that most of it is from restructuring. Simon can give you the exact number later, but I wouldn't be surprised if 90% of it is restructuring. As a matter of fact, it is 90% restructuring.","Emily Wagner","All right. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Okay. Well, with that, thank you very much for being on our call. We very much appreciate your interest in the company and we look forward to talk to you next quarter and report even better results. Thank you again.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation."],"387":["Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.","Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Simon Moore","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2017 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions.","Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and in today's earnings release. As you know, on October 01, 2016 Air Products completed the spin-off of Electronic Materials, as Versum Materials, and on January 03, 2017, Air Products completed the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik. The Q1 results, prior period comparisons and forward guidance we are sharing today, are based on Air Products continuing operations. In other words, they don\u2019t include the discontinued operations of EMD or PMD.","Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter of strong safety and financial results. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on executing our strategic Five-Point Plan. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.47, up 9% over last year and in the top half of our guidance range for the quarter. And we had excellent safety performance.","Now, please turn to slide number three, I am incredibly proud of our team for operating whole quarter, about 8 million man-hours without a single employee loss time accident. Considering that we have 16,000 employees working around the globe in a variety of operating environments, a last time accident rate of zero is outstanding. This performance is the best indicator that all of our people are focused, disciplined, engaged and aware of the highest standards of performance required in Air Products. We did all work hard to strive for this performance in the months and years to come. I want to thank every one of our Air Products employees for their focus, attention and discipline.","Now, please turn to a slide number four, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the Company. We are determined to continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.","Now please turn to a slide number five, here you can see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long-term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our Company, or growth rates. In addition, Air Products has a significant amount of cash on hand and the effective deployment of that cash is one of the most important responsibilities that I have as a CEO of the Company.","Now, please turn to slide number six, our Five-Point Plan that we announced 2.5 years ago. I want to take a moment and expand on the first point, our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2014, we announced that our strategic goal is to focus on our core industrial gases business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to a spin-off Material Technologies and set September 2016 as the target date to get the job done. I'm very pleased that as a result for an excellent effort by many people in Air Products and especially the people in our former Material Technologies business, we successfully got the job done in correlations with our plan in two steps. Step one was to a spin-off tax free to our shareholders, our electronics material division as a new company, called Versum Materials, which is we successfully have started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 03, 2016.","Step two was to sell our performance material division to Evonik. The transaction was announced in May 2016, and we closed and received $3.8 billion of cash earlier this month. As a result of these actions completing the first step of our strategic plan, we now have more than $3 billion of cash that we can deploy to make acquisitions to profitably grow our core Industrial Gases business.","Talking about growth, I think this an appropriate time to draw your attention to the fact that we have made announcements on January 08th and again on January 20th, that we have made the preliminary non-binding indication of interest to acquire Yingde Gases, a Hong Kong listed company and a major industrial gas company in China. We seek to engage in a friendly transaction with the company, which we believe would be very beneficial to the employees, customers and shareholders of both companies. As you may know Air Products currently has a business in China with about $1 billion of sales and more than 2,500 employees. And we are very successful operating in that country.","Now, please turn to slide number seven, where you can see our three key metrics. As you can note, our metrics moved as a result of the spin off and sale of PMD, but we remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward. Now, please go to slide number eight, which obviously is my favorite slide where you can see our quarterly progress. As you can note, we have improved our EBITDA margin by almost 1,000 basis points in the last 2.5 years.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss our results in detail. Then I\u2019ll come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be more than pleased to answer your questions. Scott?","Scott Crocco","Thank you very much Seifi. Now, please turn to slide nine for a more detailed review of our Q1 results. Sales of $1.9 billion increased 1% versus last year, as higher volumes and higher energy pass-through more than offset an unfavorable currency impact of 3%. Volumes were 2% higher, primarily due to strength in Industrial Gases Asia and continued progress on our Jazan project. This was somewhat offset by the expected weakness in L&G, and our other sales equipment businesses, which we mentioned last quarter related to our FY17 guidance. In other areas, volumes were lower in Gases Americas and EMEA. Corning will provide more color shortly.","Pricing remains largely unchanged across our businesses. We delivered operating leverage again this quarter, as EBITDA of $652 million improved by 3% and operating income of $408 million improved by 6%. EBITDA margin of 34.7% and operating margin of 21.7%, improved by 80 and 110 basis points respectively as we continue to executive on our Five-Point plan. Higher energy pass-through reduced operating margins by 30 basis points. Operating margin was up 140 basis points, excluding the impact of higher energy pass-through. Versus prior year, net income increased 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew by 9%, ROCE of 12.7% improved by 180 basis points versus last year.","Now, please turn to slide 10. You\u2019ve heard Seifi and talk about our focus on cash flow. Our free cash flow was $103 million this quarter, down $19 million versus last year despite the higher EBITDA, due to the higher maintenance CapEx and higher cash taxes based on timing.","Turning to slide 11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance, I would like to spend the moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.32 per share or about $80 million pre-tax. We saw Materials Technologies business separation cost of $30 million or $0.12 per share for legal and advisory fees. As you remember, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we made the decision to exit our Energy-from-Waste business and moved it into discontinued operations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we determined it was unlikely that a buyer would assume the remaining assets or contract obligations at the site. As a result, this quarter, we recorded an impairment charge in continuing operations of $50 million or $0.19 per share for air separation unit in our EMEA segment, which was intended to provide oxygen to the Energy-from-Waste plants.","Additionally, in discontinued operations, which is where we report results for the Energy-from-Waste business, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $60 million, primarily associated with a land lease to the Energy-from-Waste assets. We expect to see cost action and pension settlement costs continue through next year. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest Materials Technologies.","Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in an appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.47 increased $0.12 per share or 9% versus last year. Volumes decreased EPS by $0.07 per share, primarily due to lower activity in our LNG business. Pricing, energy and raw materials, taken together, decreased EPS by a penny. Net cost performance was $0.19 per share, favorable, primarily driven by our productivity actions.","Other income and expense on the consolidated P&L is about $20 million higher than last year. Compared to the FY16 quarterly average, OIE is up about $10 million. This is mainly due to the accounting for Transitioned Service Agreements of TSAs, where we are billing Versum and we will also be billing Evonik next quarter through various services, which Air Products continues to provide to both companies. The expenses we incurred are primarily in SG&A. What we billed to recover these expenses gets recorded in OIE.","For the quarter, currency was $0.03 per share, unfavorable. Equity affiliate income increased by $0.02 due to better results in Italy and Asia. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to lower capitalized interest. And our lower tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 versus last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 21.2%, about 350 basis points lower than recent quarter, for three main reasons.","First, our underlying rate improved by about 50 basis points, as a result of separating the MT business. Second, we adopted a new accounting standard for share-based compensation that result in about 150 basis points reduction this quarter. This benefit will vary quarter-to-quarter, and we expect it will be smaller for the rest of the year. And finally, this quarter\u2019s rate benefitted from some favorable onetime adjustments, including foreign tax law changes worth about 150 basis points. We expect the rate for fiscal year 2017 to be about 23%.","Turning to slide 12, I'd like to make a few comments on our 31 December balance sheet, and subsequent changes as shown on the pro forma column. Cash on the balance sheet as of 31 December decreased by approximately $700 million versus 30 September to a balance of $600 million, as a result of the utilizing the cash from Versum spin-off to repay commercial paper. The current or pro forma cash balance, after receiving PMD sales proceeds of $3.8 billion, is approximately $4.4 billion.","We are currently investing the PMD proceeds in short-term deposits at approximately 1%. Over the next few quarters, we will pay about $1 billion in taxes associated with the significant gain on the PMD sale. Total debt of $4.3 billion as of 31 December is down approximately $1.4 billion from 30 June, which is prior to the spin and the sale.","As we have said, our goal is to manage our debt balance to maintain our A, A2 credit rating, and we believe that our 31 December debt balance of $4.3 billion meets that requirement. As you may have seen, in January, S&P upgraded our business risk profile from strong to excellent due to our portfolio transformation to focus on the core industrial gas business, and also our significant EBITDA margin improvement. So, after we pay taxes on the PMD sale and keep about $300 million to operate the business, you can see that we have about $3 billion to invest in our core industrial gas business.","Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning Painter","Thanks, Scott. Our industrial gas business began 2017 with another solid quarter, despite the challenging external environment with tepid economic growth and currency headwinds, our unwavering focus on productivity drove margins up in EMEA and the Americas, while in Asia, we grew China retail sales by double-digits. I would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control, most importantly safety but also serving our customers well and delivering solid business results.","Next, I\u2019d like to share another example of the productivity actions we are taking to drive our business improvement. We recently completed a program to uniquely tag each of our packaged gas cylinders in nearly every country in which we operate. Knowing the exact location of each individual cylinder, allows us to run our cylinder fill and distribution systems much more efficiently. We\u2019ve also found that it enables us to better protect our assets from being refilled by unauthorized third-party.","Now, please turn to slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Our continued focus on taking the lead productivity actions enabled us to modestly improve margins despite weak volumes and the headwind from higher energy pass-through from increased natural gases prices. Sales of $864 million were up 3% versus last year as 2% lower volumes were more than offset by 5% higher energy pass-through, while pricing was flat. Latin American volumes were down close to 10%, primarily on packaged gases and welding consumables. This lowered overall Americas\u2019 volumes by 1%.","North America volumes also impacted overall Americas\u2019 volumes by 1%, as helium and steel weakness offset slightly positive LOX\/LIN volumes. HyCO volumes were modestly positive as the volume contribution from our new plant in Canada was mostly offset by customer and plant maintenance outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Sequential volumes were impacted by HyCO outages and lower seasonal LOX-LIN demand.","Operating income of $224 million was up 6% and EBITDA of $350 million was up 5% versus last year as the benefits from our taking the lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes. Operating margin of 25.9% was up 60 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.5% was up 40 basis points. Higher energy pass-through reduced the operating margin by about 90 basis points, mean that the underlying operating margin was up 150 basis points, excluding energy pass-through.","Now, please turn to slide 14. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the team continues to deliver margined expansion despite volume weakness and headwinds from currency. Versus last year, sales of $400 million were down 9% on 2% lower volumes, flat pricing, a negative 1% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily the British pound. Liquid volumes while packaged gas volumes, on a cylinders per work day basis, were up slightly. But with less work days this year, volumes were down overall. Other than the continued currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote had much impact on our business this quarter.","Operating income of $88 million and EBITDA of $140 million were both down 5%, but both would have been up slightly on a constant currency basis as our productivity actions more than offset the impact from lower volumes and higher electricity tariff rates. We are working to recover the impact of the higher electrical costs in our liquid bulk business. Operating margin of 22% was up 100 basis points and EBITDA margin of 35% was up 160 basis points, driven by productivity. Sequentially, profits were impacted by currency, the higher electrical costs and volumes.","Now, please turn to slide 15, Gases-Asia, where you can see the ramp-up of our new plants and the strength in our merchant business continued to deliver growth. Sales of $438 million were up 6% as volume growth of 10% was partially offset 1% on price and 3% on currency. Just over half of the volume increase was from new plants, primarily an increase primarily an increase in utility cost pass-through.","Our merchant business was up mid single-digits across Asia and our China retail LOX\/LIN business was again up double digits as we've improved the quality of this business. Overall, merchant pricing was down slightly, primarily due to helium as overall Asia LOX\/LIN pricing and China LOX\/LIN pricing were both positive. We've seen improvement in the China LOX\/LIN plant loadings, in fact we're essentially sold-out for certain products in some regions of China. But overall, industry overcapacity still remains.","Operating income of $118 million was up 1% and EBITDA of $178 million was down 1%. Profits were flat as the utility pass-through is, by definition, at zero margin and we had headwinds from currency, and about $5 million of positive non-recurring items a year-ago. Operating margin of 26.9% was down 140 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.7 was down 290 basis points versus last year, driven mainly by the increase in utility cost pass-through. Sequentially, margins rebounded on lower costs.","Finally, earlier this month, we announced the next phase of our gas complex in Pyeongtaek City, South Korea. We are building a second plant to support our customer\u2019s semi-conductor fab business. This builds on the major project we announced at the same sight in 2015.","I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business, as well as costs associated with industrial gas business, which are not region specific. Sales were up, versus prior year, driven by progress on the Jazan ASU, sale of equipment project this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. Segment profits were up versus prior year, as we continue to recognize profit on the Jazan project. You'll recall that we had a catch-up profit booking last quarter, which is why profits are down sequentially.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for comment on our corporate segment.","Simon Moore","Thank you, Corning. Our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses, as well as corporate costs, which are not business specific. Sales and profits were down versus last year on significantly lower LNG project activity. As we have said, the lack of customer decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business and we still expect at least $0.25 headwind in LNG for FY17 versus FY16. We did see a positive impact from our productivity actions.","Now, please turn to slide 16, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you again, Simon. Before we take any questions, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook. Please turn to slide number 16. As we move forward, I want to report to our shareholders that Air Products is in a very strong position. In the past 2.5 years, we have totally reorganized the Company in accordance with our Five-Point plan. We have implemented meaningful productivity plans, resulting in 1,000 basis improvement in our margins.","We have put in place a very robust and effective regionally focused organization with highly qualified managers in place. Our safety performance has vastly improved an indication that they have the engagement and participation of all of our 16,000 employees. The productivity programs we have implemented and the new ones under way will continue to drive our earnings per share as they have done in the past 10 quarters.","In addition, we have focused our portfolio on our core Industrial Gases business, and as a result of the divestment of non-core assets, we now have an excellent balance sheet, which is, by far, the best in the industry. Reflecting our financial strength, this morning, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.09 or 10% to $0.95 per share per quarter for the dividend payable in May. We have never had a larger cent per share dividend increase. We remain confident in the tremendous growth opportunities to invest in our core business, which is Industrial Gases, and our strong financial position allows us to also reward our shareholders directly through dividend increase and profit acquisitions.","So, in short, we are confident about the steps of our Company, but we are a global Company with only 40% of our sales in United States. We do not manufacture products in the U.S. that are exported to other parts of the world. We also do not manufacture products in the rest of the world that are imported into United States. Our business is local to where our customers are around the world. Therefore, like any other global company, we are not immune to macroeconomic or geopolitical events that can impact our business.","The new administration in United States has not yet articulated its full economic portfolio and policy. In Europe, six months after the referendum, it remains unclear how the UK government will address the exit from the European Union. Is it a soft Brexit, hard Brexit or Brexit at all now that the UK Parliaments has to vote on the issue. In addition, it is impossible to predict how other countries will react to the new economic and political developments in the United States and Europe. All of these events can have significant impact on the level of economic activity and the exchange rates in the areas we operating in.","As a result, we are now more cautious in our outlook. Our guidance for the full year 2017 EPS is $6 to $6.25 per share, which at midpoint, is an increase of 9% over last year; one of the most bullish predictions than any other industrial gas or chemical companies that I have heard of. Our guidance for EPS in the second quarter of fiscal \u201917, that is next quarter, is $1.30 to $1.40 per share.","At this time, I do want to once again thank all of our employees at Air Products for our excellent safety and financial performance in the first quarter. Our entire team is focused on delivering industry leading performance as we move forward. Now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instruction]. And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","Katherine Griffin","This is Katherine Griffin on for David. Maybe first could we just talk about the drivers of the lower guidance, and what you guys are expecting?","Seifi Ghasemi","Drivers of the lower guidance\u2026","Katherine Griffin","Yes.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, people keep talking about lower guidance. I just want to stress, our guidance is 6% to 11% increase versus last year. So, I mean the stress on the lower kind of is interesting for me. But in terms of why did we take our guidance down, there are four key elements. Number one our base for last year ended up to $0.10 lower than what we thought and we closed our books at the end of September. If you recall, we said it was going to be partial and before. We have reported this public within the beginning of January it is 564, so that is $0.10.","Our LNG business is doing worse than we thought because we haven't had any orders for our LNG that is $0.05 more negative. Our volumes, we are being cautious and that will affect us about $0.05. We might be wrong on that but that is what we are forecasting right now. And then the currency is about $0.05 worse. So that adds up-to about $0.25 that is the difference between our guidance today versus it was at the end of October.","Katherine Griffin","And talking about the Chinese industrial gas market in terms of on-site merchant and packaged business, could you just talk about how you are -- what you are seeing in that competitive landscape?","Seifi Ghasemi","You mean about business in China in general, or about\u2026","Katherine Griffin","Yes, in general.","Seifi Ghasemi","I would like to turn that over to Corning, to kind of expand on that.","Corning Painter","So Katherine I am going to focus mainly on on-sites and liquid bulk. The participation of ourselves and other majors in packaged gases there is a bit small. So, on the on sight basis, it's relatively stable and we see the step changes as new plants come on. Bidding activity is -- we\u2019re in discussion with people and that sort of continues. The liquid bulk side, as I reported in my prepared comments that we continue to see loading of our plants, we continue to see an increase of the loading on the retail sales portion of it. So, all-in-all, I think that\u2019s speaks to despite all or whatever news is out there, a fundamental momentum in the Chinese economy and certainly in our business.","Seifi Ghasemi","Does that answer your question?","Katherine Griffin","Yes, thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Chris Parkinson","Pertaining to any potential M&A activity, you used very broadly comment on your strategic thinking updates, I imagine it's probably all of these things. But just to focus on on-site businesses, geographic diversifications, skill and density benefits, opportunistic valuations. Just any color on how you\u2019re thinking about the evolution of your longer term portfolio, and any risks that you are or are not willing to take from an asset perspective? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","We are, in general, as we have said many times, focused on making acquisitions that will increase our percentage of on-site business. That is one of the reasons that we are pursuing the acquisition of Yingde, which is a company with almost more than 85% on-site. So that, in general, is the direction that we are going, and we do have a lot of opportunities. We had talked about asset buybacks, most of that asset buybacks are in the on-sight business. So that is a direction that we are going.","In terms of geographically, we obviously are focused on areas where we think there is going to be growth. If you look to chasing growth, you have go to places where the population is growing or the standards of living is going up. Because if you don\u2019t have those things you can talk about growth as much as you want but you are not going to get it. So, therefore, we are focused on China, which we believe has great potential. We are focused on India. We are focused on Mexico and we are focused on the Gulf Coast of United States. So, there are some opportunities in Europe and also in Russia. So, we are looking at around the world. But the emphasis is more on the on-site business, which is consistent with what we have said before.","Chris Parkinson","And generally on macro expectations, you hit on a few things in the UK. But as we\u2019re heading further into \u201917, it appears that activity in LatAm is actually picking up a little bit. Europe's mix, but on the whole moving in the right direction, I suppose. Just given that some major elections coming up, just how are you thinking about general macro and also the willingness of growth in business investments? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","In Europe.","Chris Parkinson","In Europe and in Latin America, as well. Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, LatAm -- so let me try to take that in America first. Latin America is weak. We at least are seeing some weakness in Chile. We continue to see weakness in Brazil at least for our own business. So, that is -- we are talking about Latin America, excluding Mexico. Then, with respect to Europe, up to now we have not seen any significant changes. Our business is moving along in kind of a stable way. It's nothing to write home about, but at the same time it is not following the product, so it's kind of a steady thing. The risk in Europe for us is if there is a major shift in currency exchange rates, which is not obviously -- it's just translation, but it could have an effect on the EPS that we report.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with J. P. Morgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Your price raw materials variance was negative in the quarter. Can you talk about pricing in the different geographic areas, and whether you expect this variance to improve in the course of the year?","Seifi Ghasemi","I think we have a detailed explanation. But I'll ask Corning to address that.","Corning Painter","Probably the most exciting region for us in terms of, let's say on the cost side if you are thinking about margin, was definitely in Europe. And in Europe, typically, France is a net exporter of attractively priced nuclear power and had a number of power stations down at one point I think around 40. And that's really disrupted the power market on the Continent. So, that's been a challenge for us. We\u2019re working to recover that in our business, and that gets an opportunity for this going forward.","Seifi Ghasemi","Does that answer your question, Jeff?","Jeff Zekauskas","Can you also talk about industrial gas pricing in the United States? And how you think that trend might change in the course of the year?","Corning Painter","Yes, so pricing in the U.S. somewhat impacted right now, I'd say one of the biggest movers for us is the overall helium in market. And that we continued, I think have gone through a period where we have over-supply and the world is working its way through that. I think looking forward on pricing I'd rather not make too many forward statements in that department. But I think the helium is one very much driven by supply and demand as that gets absorbed and in the U.S. DLM to be helium facility moves towards greater maturity and ultimate closure, I think is going to be an offset to that.","Seifi Ghasemi","Does that answer your questions?","Jeff Zekauskas","Yes, thanks very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Chris Evans","Can you quantify any impact from stranded costs that's you felt in the quarter?","Seifi Ghasemi","Scott, do you want to make some comments on this?","Scott Crocco","Sure. Let me, actually, expand the question and take it through some things regarding the transition services. And I\u2019ve made some comments in my prepared remarks, but I want to make sure I get everybody granted. First as I have mentioned, we saw an increase in our other income and expense in our P&L. It was about $0.07 favorable versus prior year. But when you look at, we all know that this moves around, there is different asset sales and so forth. When you look at the quarter compared to last year average per quarter, it's up about $10 million. This is principally driven by the TSA that we began to recognize further soon.","So, what we\u2019re going to do here is we\u2019re going to provide services to both Versum and Evonik. Evonik will start in this quarter, and they\u2019ll go to next 12 to 18 months or so. The expenses that we incurred and this are principally in the SG&A line, and then we\u2019re going to offset that in other income and expense. And so, where you saw, at the beginning of that here in this quarter on a run-rate basis, should expect as we have both Evonik and Versum on, we\u2019ll see about $40 million to $45 million per year for transition services.","Once we\u2019ve stopped providing those services, there\u2019ll be some resources that activities will go away and then we don\u2019t longer need those resources because those activities go away. That will play out over the next year to year and a half. And then, additionally, we have some costs in the corporate segment, which we have to focus on eliminating. So, the TSA will cover the costs in the short-term. Once those end, we\u2019ll take the activities out. We\u2019ll take the costs out. There will probably be, we\u2019ve said in the past about $25 million total stranded cost that once all the activity goes away we\u2019ll work to offset and eliminate. Okay, hopefully that helps.","Chris Evans","Absolutely. And then I guess maybe shifting gears a bit towards your M&A strategy, specifically with Yingde, it seems to be consistent with your guided directions that you\u2019ve talked before that go for on-site, and then focus on regions like China. But if you betted that customer base, it seems to be largely focused on steel that might at risk.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, the thing is that, obviously, we have taken everything into consideration when we looked at that. But that company they have done a very good job and diversified, although their portfolio is not received. They have about 60, 70 customers and they have a lot of good customers and onsite businesses with the chemical sector. So, they have a balanced portfolio. They are not particularly exposed. And we have taken into consideration what the consequences are of the consolidation of the steel industry in China.","Chris Evans","So similar or legal or contracts, that you have in other parts of the world should we expect to that?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, I think considering that we are in the middle of these discussions, I think, it would be a very inappropriate for me to make any comments about their contracts, or anything like that. So, you allow us to see -- do the transactions, we can go to all of that with you.","Operator","The next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Just a question on the capital structure. If you were to use the $3 billion to just go out and buying assets that has EBITDA, obviously, that\u2019s a deleveraging effect. Even though, you were at the level at the end of the year once rating agencies that they were happy with. Is that the way you would expect it to work, or would you take on commensurate debt kind of at the same ratio that Air Products is today to keep their ratio the same through the acquisitions?","Seifi Ghasemi","Duffy that\u2019s an excellent question, I am very happy to answer that, because I would like to expand on that. Our goal is to maintain our A ratings. Our goal is not to de-lever Air Products. So, if we have the capacity as we buy acquisitions on all of that, we obviously have the capacity to take on more debt. The key thing is that we want net debt to EBITDA to be order of magnitude about 2 to 2.2 to maintain our A rating. As you know, some of the other people in the industry have net debt to EBITDA much higher than that and they still have an A rating. So, our goal is not to stop our growth, because we just want to de-lever to having no debt. Now, we want to maintain our A rating, and whatever that implies in terms of the net debt to EBITDA, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.","Duffy Fischer","And then obviously the Yingde bid has gotten a lot of headlines. But is it just as probably that some of other deals or what shake loose this year, some of the asset buybacks, maybe in the Middle East and different places like that?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, obviously that is our intent. As you know, we have the firing power to do a lot more than just acquisition of Yingde. We have a lot of more cash. And as you said, the more EBITDA comes in you can do more. So, we have the capacity to do a lot more. And you can rest assured that we are looking at a lot of different things, and I hope that some of those materialize soon.","Operator","Next will be James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan","With respect to the Yingde discussions, could you talk about how you deal with the currency risk there, do you have a view that the currency is not going to decline further? Or how do you see yourselves mitigating any currency risk in China?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, obviously, when we -- these industrial gases, as you know, is a local business, it will cost under local and your income is in low cost. So, there is not too much of a risk, the only risk is translation. And in addition to that if we do those acquisitions, we can always borrow locally, and all of that, set ourselves from exchange rates. That\u2019s the good thing about industrial gases, we are very local business and we do business locally.","James Sheehan","Could you also discuss how you see synergy opportunities at Yingde?","Seifi Ghasemi","As I said, since we are in the middle of this thing, I think that would be inappropriate for me to address that. I think if we ever do the deal, we obviously will make a presentation and we will give you all the details about all of our expectations.","Operator","And our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","I apologize if this has been asked; I had to hop off for a minute. But Seifi, I'm just wondering -- you referenced in the prepared remarks and in the press release the uncertainty over the -- President Trump's economic policy and so forth. But I think it's well understood that he has some issues with China. And there are all sorts of concerns out there in many different directions. So, I'm just curious what gives you the comfort to then go do a large acquisition in China, given the uncertainty surrounding economic policy and so forth.","Seifi Ghasemi","Vincent, I think what we've said and what we meant to say was that, we don\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t take a position positive or negative. The second thing is that Air Products has been in business for 75 years. During that time, we have had 14 different presidents, we shouldn\u2019t and we don\u2019t run the business on the basis of what political party is in power, because we know things change every four radius. We are looking at the long-term. China is a place that it has the population and the standard of living is going up. Those are the only things that defect economic growth.","We see economic growth there for the long-term. Therefore, if we can strengthen our position and be there, I think that would be the right thing to do, and that is our strategy. There might be things in the short-term that might affect things. But we are being paid to look at, keeping Air Products afloat for another 75 years, and taking that view that would be the right place to invest.","Vincent Andrews","And just as a follow-up, Scott, I think if I heard you correctly, the electricity costs issue that hurt the quarter. These do not have a contractual ability to recoup you're going to have to try to recoup them the ordinary way. As I seem to recall a couple of years ago, there was an electricity issue I think maybe in the U.S. that you were able to recoup quite quickly. So is this a different construct?","Seifi Ghasemi","I think Corning will address that.","Corning Painter","So, for the Continental Europe, we have a variety of different contracts that are out there. There are some that are formula that takes certain period of time, there is others where we've got the ability to surcharge, and we've started that process. So it depends really customer-by-customer and contract-by-contract. But there is the ability to go get this.","Scott Crocco","Yes, Vincent, maybe just that's around our merchant business, right. And so if you\u2019re then looking at our tonnage business, those are all under a contract with a defined formula for how they approach. And it's really not particularly material in the packaged gases space.","Seifi Ghasemi","There\u2019s a little bit of a timing here, Vincent, as you know very well.","Operator","Next is Steve Byrne with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Steve Byrne","[Technical difficulty] production in China, would that potentially lead to a tightening of the liquid oxygen and nitrogen markets?","Seifi Ghasemi","We did not hear the first part of your question. I think there was interruption. Would you be kind enough to repeat to that please?","Steve Byrne","Sure. If there is rationalization in China of coal-based chemical production, would that potentially lead to a tightening of the liquid oxygen and nitrogen markets?","Seifi Ghasemi","I would say not very much, because a lot of these big plants get supply the coal gasification facilities do not have liquid attached.","Corning Painter","I would just add, I don\u2019t see coal to chemical slowing down, especially the element of that using industrial gases. Coal and electricity, right, there has been an announcement, but that has nothing to do with the industrial gas market. Clean coal to chemical, I think, remains an area of emphasis in China.","Seifi Ghasemi","I just like to expand on that, because we obviously operate there and we keep track of these things. There was a headline that China has closed on 102 coal-fired power plants. That's a totally different subject than gasification for coal for production of chemicals. That is actually environmentally 10-times more friendly and the Chinese government has not slowed that down, and we don\u2019t see any of that at all. ","Steve Byrne","And then just as a follow-up, how would you categorize the role of intellectual property in the industrial gas industry and Air Products\u2019 overlap with global and regional peers?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, that\u2019s obviously a very broad question. We do have intellectual property on certain products that we make in terms of applications and so on. But I would say that there isn\u2019that -- nobody that claim that that is going to be make a material difference in terms of their performance with somebody else. We don\u2019t see that, and this is not like intellectual property for software or anything like that. No, that wouldn\u2019t be too much of a big deal.","Operator","Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","On the Asia gases volumes, I think this was at least the eight consecutive quarter of volume growth in high single-digits to low double-digit rates, as you ramp up the new projects. How much of your Asia sales, are now in China, and how much longer can you stay in near these high levels of this high base?","Corning Painter","So, almost $1 billion of our Asia sales are in China. In terms of the pace, there is two elements of what you see reported right now, some of that is associated with new plants and largely utility pass-through, and that\u2019s going to turn a little bit as our customers progressed in starting up their own facilities. In terms of the merchant market, well of course, that\u2019s subject to economic overall conditions. But you can see we have positive momentum there, I think most importantly positive around retail sales.","John Roberts","And then secondly, if the LNG outlook remained suppressed, could that operation become non-core? Or because its cryogenic gas equipment in engineering, would it still be due to its core in most scenarios?","Seifi Ghasemi","LNG is core business for us for sure, because there is no question that LNG will come back. Any kind of the projection that you look at for the long-term LNG will come back and that in particular is an area where we do have intellectual property. We are going to keep our LNG business for the long-term. We are going to suffer for a two years, but that is the nature of the business. LNG is core to Air Products, we always said that.","Operator","And next will be Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Seifi, I do wanted to follow-up on the capital deployment dialogue in response to an earlier question, I think you called out Mexico is a country of interest as it relates to growth along with China, India and the U.S. Gulf. Just wondering if you see any opportunity to increase your stake at infra over the next year or two? And then second piece, have you had an opportunity or is there any interest on the part of the Air Products to explore acquisition of any assets that might be casted-off from a potential combination between Praxair and Linde? Thank you.","Seifi Ghasemi","The reason that we mentioned Mexico is because there is -- Mexico is a country which has significant oil and gas resources. And we see a lot of opportunities there for us in terms of hydrogen, nitrogen, and all that kind of stuff related to the oil industry. The second thing is obviously the country has a depopulation there is a lot of opportunities there. In terms of increasing our shares in core infra, we have very good partners there, we will fit them. Obviously, we always have the ambition of being having a situation that we can consolidate that acquisition. But that is the -- it depends on our partners. We have a very good relationship with them. But if they ever would want us to increase our share, we will be more than happy to do that.","Kevin McCarthy","Any thoughts on Praxair\/Linde casted-off assets?","Seifi Ghasemi","I know you are asking me that, and I don\u2019t want to go there because I don\u2019t want to make any comments about that acquisition. Things might or might now become available, so I just want to stay away from that. If they do obviously, it would be interesting.","Kevin McCarthy","And as a follow-up, if I may on your corporate line, recognizing the dearth of LNG orders. Can you perhaps provide an outlook for run rate there for the balance of the fiscal year, please?","Seifi Ghasemi","I think the run rate there is going to be nothing to write home about, to be perfectly honest, I mean, because LNG, as I said, it is a core business for us. But the decrease in which that product or that performance has come down was a surprise because we didn\u2019t think that everybody will stop everybody, and this is what they have done.","Operator","The next question is from Nils Wallin with CLSA Brokerage.","Nils Wallin","I was hoping to drill down a little bit more on your volume guidance and the $0.05 headwind. Would you tease-out perhaps where you are seeing the greater weakness than you had a quarter ago? I was a little bit surprised given your on-site exposure. Was there any sort of expectation that volumes there might also come down?","Seifi Ghasemi","The reason that we are making a comment on the volume is that the main area we are concerned is in Europe, because of the Brexit. That one -- I mean, it hasn\u2019t had significant affect. People say that why are you worried about that, it hasn\u2019t had any significant effect on your business. Of course, it hasn\u2019t had any significant business, because nothing has been done, like it's going on. I mean, UK hasn\u2019t even announced that they are going to a Brexit and they haven't kind of invoked Article 50 yet. What we are concerned about when they actually do that and they do give notice, how would the markets react? So that is what we are being cautious about.","Nils Wallin","And then just on Yingde, I know that there's been a lot of discussion around the growth in China. Obviously, it looks like a cheap asset. But is there anything else strategically that you are seeing? Clearly, they were not builders of their own assets. Is there operational opportunities that you believe are available there?","Seifi Ghasemi","Well, obviously since they are not building their own asset that would be a great thing for us. Because then the next plant and the next plant that they would win will be built by Air Products. So, we see significant opportunity there. And they are a good company. We have a lot of respect for their people. They have very good people, and we think that the combination of them and the Air Products, will be very good for the employees. It will be good for our customers, because -- and it will give us better position in China. So, there is a lot of positives there.","Nils Wallin","Thanks very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Thank you. And we are on top of the hour, so we will take one more question and then we end the call. One more question please.","Operator","And the next question is from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Harrison","Seifi, I know the chart on slide eight is your favorite, but it could lead some observers to conclude that maybe margins have plateaued here. I know that there is some natural gas impact in there that would make the margin better, and it's obviously been a very challenging environment. But how confident are you that you can get the Company back to a positive margin trajectory in what you see as a challenging demand environment going forward?","Seifi Ghasemi","Our goal is that, in that chart, is that we will have a margin which is higher than anybody else. I think at 35% EBITDA margin, I have never made a statement that there is lot more room to go. Our goal was to be higher than other people, and which we are. So, we are not forecasting that that margin will significantly improve. All of the productivity programs that we have will go on maintaining that margin, because our costs are going up. But we have never projected that the business has the potential of having much higher margin than that. But if anybody else\u2019s margin goes to 40%, I guarantee you that we will be choosing for 41%. But quite frankly, I don\u2019t see a lot of upside on that margin.","Mike Harrison","And then I was also hoping that you could comment on your Indura business down in Chile. You\u2019ve mentioned that it was mostly packaged and hard-goods that was driving the weakness down there. Are we still looking at a business that's primarily packaged gases? Or have you been successful in expanding the amount of merchant and on-site business in Chile?","Seifi Ghasemi","Our business in Indura is challenging, because it is mostly packaged gases business and there is not a lot of opportunities to turn that around and have a lot of on-sites because there is not a lot of on-site opportunities in Chile. So, we do have an issue there. Since Corning is responsible for that, I like him to make some comments on that.","Corning Painter","Yes, so maybe just to broader picture on the whole South American situation. So, keep in mind when we look at our volumes and how they might compare. First of all, it\u2019s a clean quarter for us. We had no substantial new plants coming on in this timeframe. And also we're much more focused on Linde on Chile. But we also have Columbia and our business in Brazil is there for us as well. We are primarily packaged gases. Packaged gases has been impacted more, maybe just for what it's worth, our liquid bulk volumes in South America are positive for us in this quarter. So, it's not like we\u2019re without momentum in that space.","Seifi Ghasemi","Okay. Mike, anything else?","Mike Harrison","That's it. Thanks very much.","Seifi Ghasemi","Well,\u00a3 thank you very much. Then with that, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call today. Again, thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the best. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter 2014 Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We issued our earnings release this morning. It's available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials.","","As a reminder, we will be discussing our Q4 and FY '14 results under our previous segment structure. When we report our Q1 FY '15 earnings in January, we will be reporting under our new segment structure.","Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on this slide and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations.","Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call. We do appreciate your interest in our company. In addition to Simon and Scott, I have both of Air Products' Executive Vice Presidents, Mr. Corning Painter and Mr. Guillermo Novo, here with me to participate in the call and answer your questions.","As most of you know, I have been Chairman, President and CEO of Air Products now for 120 days. During this period I have taken the time to meet more than 4,000 of our people in small groups of 50 to 60. As a result of my discussions and observations during these meetings, I am now more than ever convinced that Air Products has a great future ahead of it.","Our people are talented, committed, dedicated and enthusiastic to restructure and rebuild Air Products to be the great company it was 20 years ago. The people of Air Products in the last 120 days have demonstrated what they are capable of delivering. Our safety and financial performance in the last quarter demonstrates the power of the 20,000 people in Air Products coming together and delivering results that exceed expectations.","Now please turn to Slide #4. Last month we presented our strategy for moving forward. We announced that our goal is to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our people have embraced the challenge, and all of us will work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to get there as soon as we can. In all of our internal meetings we start with a discussion about safety, and I would like to do the same with our investor presentations.","So please turn to Slide #5. In the fourth quarter of 2014 we delivered significant improvement in all metrics related to safety. I'm very pleased with this progress, and all of our people will focus on continuing to deliver improvements as we move forward toward our goal. Our goal is 0 accidents and 0 incidents.","Now please turn to Slide #6. Last month we presented a detailed road map and the management principles that will guide us to achieving our goals. I would like to highlight the key elements of the management principles. We believe that cash is king. Cash flow drives long-term value. What counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not our size or growth rate. I also believe that capital allocation is the most important job of the Air Products CEO right now, and we are very focused on that. In addition, we believe that a decentralized organization releases entrepreneurial energy and minimizes costs and politics.","Now please turn to Slide #7. Here are the 5 action points that will drive our performance improvement. The details of these were delineated in our September 18 presentation, which is on our website, but I would like to quickly repeat them right now. Number one, we are focused and will continue to be focused on our core Industrial Gases business. Number two, we have restructured the organization. This is a significant move to our profit centers and a regional focus, and we will report our results accordingly. Number three, we are changing the company culture. We are focused on safety, simplicity in our business processes, speed of execution and collective self-confidence that we can be #1 again. Number four, we are going to be focused on controlling capital and controlling our costs, and last quarter's results demonstrates our ability to do that. And number five, we have realigned our incentive system in such a way that they are totally aligned with the creation of value for our shareholders.","Now please turn to Slide #8. These are the highlights of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Scott later on will go through this in more details. But I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that although sales versus last year were up only 3% and sequentially up only 2%, which is in line with worldwide economic growth, our EBITDA grew by 10%, and our operating income was up 12%. This is clearly a demonstration that we are controlling our costs, and I'm very grateful to the organization for responding to the challenge to achieve this. You will also note that our margins have significantly improved. We improved our EBITDA margin by 170 basis points and our operating margin by 130 basis points.","Now please turn to Slide #9. You have heard us talk about the focus on cash, and we have said that we do not want to be in a position to be borrowing money to pay dividends. In fiscal year 2014, we had neutral cash flow, a significant improvement over fiscal year '13. As you will -- as you see, we generated $2.8 billion of EBITDA. And by the time you deduct cash taxes, cash interest, dividend and capital expenditure, we end up breakeven. The reason we were able to do this in fiscal 2014 was the significant effort in the last quarter to increase our EBITDA by controlling our costs.","Now I would like to turn this over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details of the numbers. Thank you.","M. Scott Crocco","Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our 2014 results. After a challenging second quarter, we delivered improved results in the second half of fiscal 2014 and ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter. For the year, sales of $10.4 billion increased 3% on stronger volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, where volumes were up 9% and Merchant Gases where volumes grew 3%.","We continued to focus more sharply on cash flow and specifically, EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We have updated our definition of EBITDA to include income from equity affiliate joint ventures and have provided a reconciliation in the appendix to the slides. EBITDA and operating income improved by 5% and 6% respectively on higher volumes. We delivered operating leverage for the first time in several years, as EBITDA improved by 5% and operating income improved by 6% on the 3% sales growth. EBITDA margin improved to 26.5%, while our operating margin improved to almost 16%, both up about 50 basis points versus FY '13. Earnings per share grew by 5%.","Our return on capital employed declined by 30 basis points to 9.8% for the year, primarily as a result of our capital spending and higher construction in progress, but remains well above our cost of capital. ROCE bottomed out earlier in 2014 and has begun to show improvement with Q4 coming in at 11%. I want to remind you that the new projects we are developing, executing and operating will be accretive to ROCE over the next few years. During the year, we also remained focused on delivering shareholder value. 2014 was the 32nd consecutive year of increasing the dividend, which we raised 8%.","Before I comment on our Q4 performance, I'd like to spend a moment reviewing the non-GAAP items on Slide 11. We conducted our impairment testing and concluded that the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our Latin American reporting unit were impaired as a result of the outlook for Indura, the Chilean-headquartered industrial gases company in which we own a controlling interest. We recorded a noncash impairment charge of $310 million, $275 million attributable to Air Products or $1.27 per share. This is primarily driven by a weaker outlook for the Chilean economy and the balance from the impact of tax reform legislation in Chile that was passed in September.","Next are 2 tax items that totaled a positive $31 million or $0.14 per share. A positive $52 million due to a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary was partially offset by a $21 million expense associated with the Chilean tax reform. Also included are restructuring charges and pension settlement costs totaling $18 million or $0.06 per share as a result of our decision to realign the organization. We also expect to see restructuring costs and pension settlement costs in FY '15 as we continue to simplify the organization and reduce costs. Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $1.66 increased $0.19 or 13% versus last year.","Please turn to Slide 12. Seifi provided the highlights of our Q4 results, and I would like to provide some additional details. For the quarter, sales of $2.7 billion were 3% above prior year on stronger volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant segments, and pricing was up 1%. Underlying sales were up 4%, excluding the impact from our exit of our Polyurethane Intermediates or PUI business. Sequentially, overall sales increased 2%, with underlying sales up 3%. EBITDA of $767 million was up 10%, and EBITDA margin of 28.6% was up 170 basis points versus prior year, driven by higher volumes and better cost.","A number of you have asked how you can track our progress towards our goals. We will continue to share EBITDA margin in future earnings calls. And while we wouldn't expect improvement to occur in a straight line every quarter, you should hold us accountable for improvement in this important metric.","Operating income of $472 million increased 12% versus prior year as we delivered operating leverage on better costs, higher volumes, particularly in Electronics and Performance Materials, and stronger pricing in Merchant Gases. Our operating margin of 17.6% improved 130 basis points versus prior year on a positive contribution from higher volumes and better cost performance. This was the best operating margin performance in at least 9 years. Net income and diluted earnings per share were 14% and 13% higher respectively versus last year. And as I mentioned, our instantaneous ROCE improved to 11%, up 60 basis points versus prior year.","Turning to Slide 13. You can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.66 increased by $0.19 versus last year. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.16. Pricing, energy and raw materials, taken together, contributed $0.02. Net cost performance was $0.04 favorable as we are seeing the benefits of our cost-reduction actions. The impact of the PUI business exit was $0.03. We did not see any net currency impact this quarter. Equity affiliate income was $0.01 lower. Interest expense was lower and contributed $0.02 on lower interest rates. Our tax rate of 24% remained unchanged versus prior year. Noncontrolling interest added $0.01. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02.","Now to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.","Corning F. Painter","Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 14. The Merchant Gases segment continued to show strong momentum in Q4. Our focus on pricing and cost enabled us to deliver operating leverage, as Seifi mentioned. In fact, this was the best operating margin performance for the Merchant segment in over 2 years. We are also focused on safety and serving customers while we implement the changes that will drive further improvement in our business.","Merchant Gases sales of almost $1.1 billion were up 3% last year on 2% higher volumes and 2% higher pricing. Volume growth was broad across the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Asia, while pricing was positive in the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Latin America. This was our best overall pricing quarter in almost 2 years.","Sequentially, sales were up 1% on higher volumes, which were up in all regions except Latin America. For several years, helium volumes have been trending down while pricing has trended up. With new supplies coming into the market, the supply and demand dynamics are changing. While the shortage has eased, the cost structure is evolving with typically more expensive new sources coming online and a change in the U.S. government pricing program. Going forward, we are focused on managing price, cost and sales volumes as we expect sourcing to be less of a challenge.","Merchant Gases' operating income of $186 million was up 5% from prior year and up 7% sequentially. The segment operating margin of 17.1% was up 40 basis points compared to last year and up 100 basis points sequentially. Operating leverage from the volume growth, combined with a strong cost focus and pricing results, delivered the numbers.","Now let's take a look at the Merchant business by region on Slide 15. In the U.S. and Canada, sales were up 6% on 1% higher volumes and 5% higher pricing. We saw mid-single-digit growth in our liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes, with strength in metals, chemicals and oilfield services markets. Capacity utilization improved within the upper 70s range. We saw lower services and applications equipment sales, and helium volumes were down on supply limitations. Again, we expect helium supply to be less of an issue going forward. Contract signings for the year were ahead of last year's strong results. Helium, LOX\/LIN and LAR pricing was positive in part due to the recovery of Q2 weather impacts. As you have seen, we have announced a broad-based price increase in mid-September.","In Europe, sales were up 6% from last year on 3% positive volumes and 1% higher price. This was our best European volume performance in at least 3 years, as we continue to see growth in LOX\/LIN and LAR volumes while cylinder volumes remained soft. Liquid bulk volume growth was solid across Continental Europe. Contract signings for the quarter were up significantly from last year. Overall pricing was up for the second quarter in a row on helium and cylinder price improvement, while LOX\/LIN pricing was flat. LOX\/LIN plant loadings remain in the high 70s.","In Asia, sales were up 1% from last year as 2% higher volumes were partially offset by 1% lower price. LOX\/LIN and LAR volumes were up mid-single digits across the region and up mid-teens in China. Lower helium volumes and lower equipment sales partially offset the liquid volume strength. Over the last -- over the 2 years now, Air Products has not initiated -- for over, excuse me, 2 years now, Air Products has not initiated a new investment for liquid capacity in China. So with the continued volume growth, loadings have improved within the high 70s range. As we've discussed in previous quarters, pricing continues to be pressured, particularly in China, given the industry overcapacity, which we expect to persist for a few years. Contract signings for the quarter and for the year were well above last year.","In Latin America, underlying sales were up 2% while currency reduced reported sales by 10%. Brazilian volumes were up, offset by lower economic growth in Chile. As Scott has discussed, we impaired our Latin American business due to our current outlook of lower future profit growth in the business. While the business growth rate and current performance are below our original expectations, Indura remains a profitable business for us. We are focused on cost management to improve the results despite the slower economy.","Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our tonnage and Equipment and Energy segments.","Simon R. Moore","Thanks, Corning. Please turn to Slide 16. Excluding PUI, Tonnage Gases operating income was up 10% this quarter and up 17% sequentially, primarily due to lower costs. We continue to see strong base business demand, including for hydrogen on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Overall sales of $806 million were down 4% versus last year. Gases volumes were down 1% on lower Europe sales due to plant outages. While we did see some impact on the U.S. Gulf Coast from interruptions in feedstock supply from a supplier and a few customers having plant operating challenges, we continue to see strong demand and little to no impact from the lighter, sweeter shale oil. As we have said, while shale oil availability may moderate hydrogen demand growth going forward, the U.S. Gulf Coast customers are also adding heavy Canadian oil sands to their crude slate, which brings significant hydrogen demand. And low-cost natural gas creates an operating cost advantage for the refiners, allowing them to profitably export refined products. Overall, we may see some growth moderation but don't see risk to our existing assets.","Operating income was up 17% sequentially, primarily on lower maintenance costs. Lower PUI volumes impacted sales this quarter by 4% or about $35 million and about $0.03 of profit. As a reminder, we fully exited this business in Q1 of FY '14. And for the full year, saw PUI sales down about $140 million and about an $0.08 EPS headwind. In addition to driving improvement in our base business, we continue to focus on executing our strong backlog of projects safely, on time and on budget.","As we said during this quarter, we are seeing delays in onstream timing from some of our large China customers. In some cases, our customers have minor contract flexibility in start dates, but they do not have unlimited ability to delay payments to Air Products. Our customers have not stopped or halted work, but rather are seeing their large and complicated projects take longer to get up and running. We do not see this as a fundamental long-term risk to the returns but it may impact near-term earnings over the next few quarters.","Now please turn to Slide 17. The Equipment and Energy segment continues to see strong growth as our leading global LNG position drove the profit improvement. Sales of $125 million were up 6% versus prior year and up 20% sequentially. Operating income of $27 million was up 34% versus prior year and up 57% sequentially. More higher-margin LNG projects and a strong cost focus drove the profit increase. The backlog of $520 million is up significantly as we announced an award for Freeport LNG's export terminal on the U.S. Gulf Coast and an award for a midsized Technip LNG project in Inner Mongolia, China. We've also received other customer awards that have not yet been announced. Overall, LNG project development activity remains high.","Now I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Electronics and Performance Materials segment results.","Guillermo Novo","Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 18. The Electronics and Performance Materials segment again delivered very strong results as both businesses showed double-digit volume growth, while the focus on cost and productivity delivered leverage to the bottom line. Margins have been increasing over the last few quarters, and this was the best quarterly operating margin in more than 8 years. Segment sales of $660 million were up 14% versus last year, driven by 13% higher volumes. Versus prior year, electronic sales were up 16%. Advanced materials showed strong growth as our customers continued to ramp production of their next-generation nodes, driving increased demand for our materials. Process materials also showed strong growth by leveraging its improved cost position as end-market demand and industry capacity rationalization improved volume and pricing.","Delivery Systems was up significantly as we provided equipment and installation services to a number of key fab customers and new node ramps. We would expect particularly the installation portion, which is roughly 30% to 40% of our Delivery System sales, to slow as we move through fiscal year '15. Tonnage also showed growth as we brought onstream new projects. Sequentially, sales were up 14%.","Performance Materials sales were up 11% versus last year as we saw strong growth across every region and every product line. End-market demand remains strong, and we are additionally benefiting from share gains and strong successful new product introduction. Sequentially, sales were down 1%, better than the typical seasonal decline.","Operating income of $128 million was up 33%, and operating margin was up 280 basis points to 19.3%, as leverage from higher volumes was expanded with strong cost performance. We remain on track and are delivering on our business restructuring and cost reduction programs. Sequential operating income was up 19%, and margins improved 200 basis points even compared to a strong Q3. As I mentioned, the team delivered significant profit improvement and the best operating margins in over 8 years. Innovation-driven growth, pricing, manufacturing productivity, cost improvements and share gains all contributed to the strong performance and allowed us to gain leverage from the improving market conditions.","As a reminder, our Q1 results will be for the Materials Technologies segment, which will not include our electronics on-site business. We're excited about the new and more focused Materials Technologies segment, and the team is looking forward to driving further improvements. Now I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Thank you very much, Guillermo. Now please turn to Slide #19. At this point, based on what we know today, our guidance for fiscal year 2015 is for earnings per share of $6.30 to $6.55. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of 11% over our fiscal year 2014 results.","We are focused on actions that we can control to deliver these results next year. Our new organization enables us to reduce overhead cost, which will continue to improve cash flow and earnings in 2015. Our new organization will allow us to be more effective and improve the performance of our existing assets and businesses. And we will have a laser focus on cost reduction, especially pricing improvement and asset utilization.","Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 is for earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.50. At midpoint, this would represent a growth of about 10% versus quarter 1 fiscal year '14. Please note that the sequential drop from quarter 4 of this year is driven by lower seasonal volumes across our businesses and an increase in maintenance costs for our on-site plants.","As for capital expenditure for fiscal year 2015, we estimate that to be around $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, as we focus on our core business and, as you know, we have raised our required project returns. You can see a split of the capital by the new reporting segments in appendix Slide #22.","I also want to remind you that we will be reporting our first quarter of 2015 results in January under our new segmentation. To help understand the new segments, we expect to provide historical results of the new segments in December of 2000 -- of calendar 2014.","Now please turn to Slide #20. I shared this slide with you in September. This is the plan we are following to drive us toward our goal to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. This will enable us to accomplish our overall mission, which is to create value for our shareholders. Our new organization is in place. The right people have the right authority and the right accountability for results, and we have the right rewards system in place. We are focused on our core business and we are implementing a culture which is focused on safety, simplicity, speed and self-confidence. We have already -- you have already begun to see the results of our hard work in our fourth quarter results, as we just announced, and we expect that good performance to continue into next year. I continue to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products and the ability of our committed and dedicated people to deliver excellent results as we move forward.","Now with that, we are delighted to answer your questions. Anthony?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","It appears we have our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Seifi, since you've taken over, pricing seems to be at the front and center. There have been several price increases announced. I think U.S. merchant price was up 5% in the quarter. So can you talk about your pricing strategy? And how do you manage pricing versus volume trade-off?","Seifollah Ghasemi","That's an excellent question, P.J. When I looked at Air Products' costs during the past 15, 20 years, quite honestly, and the prices that we are getting for the outstanding products that we produce, prices have not kept up with the increase in our costs. I mean, we obviously have to pay our people more. The cost of raw materials go up. We have not recovered our cost increases. And therefore, I think it is imperative for us to push the pricing so that we can at least recover the cost. We are not asking people -- we are very focused on improving productivity and all of that to keep our costs under control. But historically, Air Products has not recovered its cost increases as a result of price. Therefore, we are very much focused on that.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And a question for Corning. You were around when Indura was acquired. And today, you guys wrote down almost 1\/3 of the Indura purchase price. So can you do a little postmortem for us on Indura and what went wrong relative to your expectations?","Seifollah Ghasemi","P.J., I'd like to answer that because Corning was not around when that acquisition was made. He was not responsible for that business at all. He had nothing to do with it. The reason that we are where we are is that when you look at Indura's performance, Indura's performance hasn't really changed that much during the years. What had happened is that at the time of the acquisition, the expectations that was put out to justify the purchase price and the goodwill, those assumptions were wrong. There were assumptions for significant growth in Latin America that has not materialized. There was assumptions for synergies that have not materialized. That is the reason that we have to take the write-off. The write-off is not something that we came in and said, \"Oh, we have to take a write-off.\" As you know, in accordance with good accounting practices, every quarter we look at all of our assets and see if they are impaired. And when we looked at all of our assets, the good news is that nothing else was impaired. But then you look at Indura, it was impaired. We had paid too much for the business, and we have to take about half of their goodwill out. So that -- I hope that clarifies the situation, P.J.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe a couple of questions on the tonnage business. I think the tonnage volumes for Air Products this year, exclusive of PUI, were down. And I was wondering if you could diagnose why they were down. And I was hoping you could also provide some detail about the delay in China projects, which projects they are and what's the magnitude of the delay?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Very good. Jeff, I'll try to answer this thing in a general way, and then I'll turn it over to Scott -- to Simon to give you more details. First of all, if I may answer your second question first, the delay in the China project is actually, right now, 2 of the projects. I don't want to name them, but it is basically 2 of the projects are about -- delayed about 2 quarters from what we expected. And the projects are -- it is not as if the projects are not viable. It is just that when you are building a $10 billion facility, which we are part of it, there is delays in the start-up and all of that. We do not expect this to be a major issue for us. We do not expect to be taking any write-offs, and we have taken these delays fully into consideration when we gave you our guidance. So it's not as if next quarter, we are going to say, \"Well, we have to adjust our guidance because the projects are delayed.\" We know where they are and we have taken that into consideration. In the long term, we don't see any problems there. With respect to their volumes for our existing businesses, their shortfall in volume is mainly in Europe, and I'll have Simon comment on that.","Simon R. Moore","Great. Thank you, Seifi. And Jeff, I think maybe if I could just frame that, I believe you asked about the full year. And I think as you reflect on the full year volumes in tonnage, first of all, it's contributed by the fact that we didn't have the new plants come onstream. But also as you remember, particularly back in Q2 and Q3, we had a lot of outages that were planned. Our customers planning our outages, we take the plants down, and so that limited our volume opportunities. So as we bring the new plants on next year, we would expect that to improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So with regard to the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, the margins have taken a solid jump up. And I guess I'm wondering if you can parse out what's -- what the major drivers behind that are? How much might be tied to cost cutting versus just the incremental volumes you've seen with the electronics recovery?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Sure, John. I'm going to have Guillermo answer that. But in general, I would like to say that the margins have jumped up because if you recall, when we're discussing this last quarter, I said that, that business has a lot of room for improvement. What we have done is that we have an outstanding team running the place. What we have done is that we have given them authority. We have given them the room to run, and they are doing a great job in running the business. And I think they have a great future ahead of them. I'm very pleased with the management team and the restructuring that Guillermo has done, but -- Guillermo?","Guillermo Novo","I think there are several dimensions that are driving the improvement. First, if you remember last year, we said we were going to drive a significant improvement program in our Performance Materials business, which was one of the underperforming segments. And we have been delivering exactly on that, reducing our costs, improving plant productivity, shifting a lot of our production capabilities to Asia, where we are in a more competitive position. So all those activities that we had planned have been delivered, and that has been a big driver to our overall improvement, so that cost productivity is a big driver. In doing that, as the market has improved and capacity utilizations have improved, we've also been able to take advantage of our competitive position to gain share and improve our pricing position in that area. So that's for the process material side. In the advanced materials, although we started a little bit slower in the first part of the year because of just delays from the industry and the [indiscernible]. Towards back end of the year, we are starting to see that movement, and that's -- a lot of our advanced materials are newer products that come at a higher margin and improve our mix. And lastly, I would say it's in the Delivery Systems. We've also taken productivity initiatives to improve our overall competitiveness in that segment. And we've been able to pick up some additional business during the year, which also helped our loading. So as I said in my comments, there's a lot -- a lot of things have happened, not one single thing that drove our overall improvement.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then maybe just a -- with a follow-up question. On SG&A, we saw a pretty solid drop down, both sequentially and year-over-year. I guess I'm wondering if there's any kind of onetime-ish type items. Or is this just the beginning of the costs cuts to come?","Seifollah Ghasemi","I'd like to have Scott comment on that.","M. Scott Crocco","Sure. So we're focused, as you heard from us in the past and Seifi this morning, on costs and you saw that in the SG&A line. Going forward, where are we going to be next year? We have to continue to drive it down, both on an absolute basis as well as on a percentage-of-sales basis. So I'm not giving guidance in the future for SG&A, but that's going to be a particular area of focus. We delivered results in the fourth quarter and we expect to continue to do so going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Neal P. Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Neal Sangani on for Bob. During the quarter, can you tell us specifically what you did around cost reduction in the fourth quarter? And what's incrementally ahead?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, what we did in the cost reduction is obviously we reduced our staff and the number two is that we controlled travel costs. We controlled all the consulting costs. We controlled all of the -- as you know, it's not one item that you do, it's 10,000 things that you have to do. But I challenged the organization in July when we started, and they have responded. Everybody watches everything that we do. We don't make unnecessary trips. We don't have fancy conferences in fancy resorts. And obviously, there has been people reduction in terms -- in our different businesses. I'd like to have Scott make some additional comments.","M. Scott Crocco","Sure. Thank you, Seifi. So just to build -- just to remind folks, we took a provision last year, and we concluded the savings associated with that provision here in the fourth quarter, $45 million or so for this year with an annual rate of about 75. So we'll see that going into next year. That's been brought to closure. And then also we've taken actions in this quarter under the new organization. And you saw, we've had a provision of about $13 million in this quarter reflective of additional actions that we're going to take, that we have taken and that we're going to continue to take going forward. So just wanted to frame and remind folks that there was the conclusion of the previous efforts and now the beginning of the efforts going forward under the new organization.","Neal P. Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just a follow-up on electronics. You stated when you came onboard that noncore businesses like Electronics and Performance Materials would need to be improved or divested. How does that fit with the bounce back in volumes and margins you saw this quarter? And can you also tell us what the revenue base in margins would look like once you remove some of the on-site products?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, we challenged -- we have told them that they get their margins up to where the gases margin are. That means an operating margin of around 24%, 25% operating margin, that we would love to keep the business. I mean, it's a great business, great people, and they are making significant improvements toward that goal. So -- and at the rate that they are going, I think that they will be able to achieve that. Guillermo, do you want to make any additional comments?","Guillermo Novo","No, I think I said we're very, very happy with the overall performance. I think one of the questions was around the tonnage part of the business. You'll see those numbers as we roll them out, but it is part of the investor presentation we've made in the past. We break it out. I think roughly you can calculate around $350 million would be the Tonnage Gases portion of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wondering if you could just help us a little bit with the composition of 2015. How much earnings or EPS do you expect from sort of new plant loadings? And then can you talk to us a little bit about how much EBITDA should grow and where EBITDA margins should go for the full year, just so that we could help benchmark your progress relative to what you're asking your employees to do?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, thanks for the question. But we have decided not to really get into the details of how many cents from new plants and how many cents from this and that. We consider that to be a little bit of a getting into too much detail. And in addition to that, if something is delayed in terms of new plants, we do something else to make up for that. So we are not going to really go through that kind of a detail. But in general, I would say that we expect that our EBITDA margins to continue to improve. We are -- as you know, our goal is to get to an EBITDA margin of 32%, 33%. This quarter, we were at around 28%. Next year we will probably be around that and then hopefully, improve every quarter.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, on the 11% instantaneous ROCE, can you just help us understand how the Indura write-off was accounted for in that?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Okay. Scott will answer that. Scott?","M. Scott Crocco","Yes. So in that instantaneous this quarter, very little impact that you see in there. I think going forward and if I just pull it back, broadly speaking, post the write-down of the LASA reporting unit, call it 20 basis points improvement from the change in the denominator. So that's about the ballpark.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you took Indura out of the denominator and helped by 20 basis points. Is that the answer?","M. Scott Crocco","As part of a write-down, then the denominator gets lower. And it's about a 20 basis point impact for ROCE going forward, roughly.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Not that significant.","M. Scott Crocco","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the restructuring, Seifi, should we expect a large charge going forward? Or similar to this past quarter, smaller charges over the next few quarters?","Seifollah Ghasemi","We are not going to take a onetime one large charge. But I should think that you should expect that during the year, as -- we are going to take the charges as incurred as we do the restructuring. Whatever they charges us, we'll report you. But I expect that if you add up all of those numbers for fiscal year 2015, that would come out to a substantial number if you are going to achieve and do what we have suggested that we are going to do.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Very good. And just on the 2 large China projects that are being delayed. What's the EPS impact in 2015 versus prior expectations?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, David, if you don't mind, as I said, we have taken that into consideration when we gave you the forecast. But I don't want to quote a specific number, if you don't mind.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question. Now that you've kind of reset the capital bar and obviously getting tighter with capital, Seifi, how do you think about over a longer period of time what the natural growth rate is for your business?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Actual growth rate? Well, it obviously depends on the worldwide economy. But we believe that Air Products has the capacity and we should grow at least at 1.5x GDP worldwide. That would be a natural growth rate.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then expectations among the investment community is for call it roughly $600 million of kind of cost outs from this time you started. Can you walk us through how you think the cadence of that will flow through what you can get? Or maybe what you've got already? What you can get within the next 1 year and then maybe what takes 2 to 3 years to get?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, we expect that out of those $600 million, if we are going to achieve our goal, I think we have said, Duffy, that about half of that will be from SG&A and overhead costs. And the other half will come from fundamentally the runoff facilities and efficiency and distribution, power consumption and all of the other things that we do. So that's the overall breakdown. In terms of breaking it down by years, we'll see how fast we can run. In our forecast that we have given you for next year, obviously, we are assuming that we will have some of that cost saving under our belt. But I don't want to give you a very specific number, but that's the order of magnitude of the numbers, Duffy.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Scott, just wondering if you could give us some color on how you see return on capital trends unfolding over the next year.","M. Scott Crocco","Right. So from an instantaneous perspective, we'd expect it to come down a little bit given the first quarter and the traditional seasonality that we see in the business. But in general -- generally speaking, improvement going forward as we load the assets that we have and bring the projects that are in backlog, and importantly, drive the earnings improvement from the productivity efforts that we have. So we'd expect that to improve going forward as well as all the other metrics that we've talked about, cash flow and so forth.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And one for Seifi, on the cost controls that you've delivered so far are pretty strong. I'm just wondering if you could characterize the cost cuts you've done so far. Would you see that as low-hanging fruits that the pace of cost control slows going forward? Or how do you see that unfolding?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, Jim, my friend, nothing is low-hanging fruit. It doesn't come out easily. But I have to give a lot of credit to the organization for responding to the challenge, and we are controlling every aspect of our cost. And as I said, it's not 1 or 2 items. It's not one magic wand. It's 10,000 different things that people do every day in running our business. So -- and none of that is easy, but -- and it is painful. But the organization has decided that we want to go back to where we were 20 years ago, be the best performing industrial gas company in the world, and they are moving toward that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Seifi, I want to go back to your guidance for fiscal '15. It's above consensus despite obviously some big headwinds out there in terms of economic growth, currency and pension. So 2 questions. One, what is the pension and currency headwind you've built into your numbers? And how would you characterize your growth in terms of how much is cost driven versus how much is really volume driven?","Seifollah Ghasemi","That's an excellent question, Don. First of all, in terms of volumes, you know the economic situation in the world better than I do. We are not counting on getting any significant help from economic growth. So we are not counting that our top line will grow a lot, maybe 2% or maybe even less. What we are counting on is on our ability to focus on the things that we control, which is basically our cost and productivity. And obviously, we are also counting on pricing to make sure that we get the right prices for our products. That's the direction that we are going. In terms of currency, now I'd just like to give you a general number. I know everybody is concerned about the euro and all of that. Our exposure in Europe -- no, maybe we should give you some numbers to frame this thing in a better way that our total exposure to Europe is about 26% of our Air Products sales. But 30% of that European exposure is primarily our pipeline network in Rotterdam. So really, only 18% of Air Products sales are exposed to the economy within Europe. But that includes a little bit of our Performance Materials business. But the significant majority of the 18% is our Merchant business. And of that, 25% of that is in U.K. and Ireland. So we don't really have too much exposure to the U.S. currency today, general economic conditions in Europe. In terms of currency, the biggest swing can come from the -- from euro. And on that one, order of magnitude, 10% change in the value of euro, a 10% change will affect our EPS by about $0.07 or $0.08. So that's the kind of thing that we have done. With respect to pension and so on, I'd like Scott to comment on that.","M. Scott Crocco","Right. I would expect, while it's not final, Don, call it roughly even FY '15 versus '14, not a big movement in pension expense.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Then one follow-up, Seifi, I know you're very focused on improving the density of your assets to improve returns. Have you thought of any closures in the U.S.? I mean, your operating ratio is still only in the high 70s. Are there areas in the U.S. where you don't have the density you need? And could you help yourself out by shuttering some plants?","Seifollah Ghasemi","I don't think we need to shut down some plants. So the density thing can only be improved significantly if we do any kind of swaps with other people. On that one, there are plenty of ideas around, but the issue is fundamentally, what would the authorities approve? I mean, with these things it's always easy to talk about it. But in the real world, there are restrictions from an antitrust point of view about market concentration, about what we can and what we cannot do. We are not counting on that as a significant factor for improving our results. We are open to suggestions. We are open to discussions. But quite honestly, we haven't built anything like that into our forecast.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If we look at the last 3 years and consider the seasonal pattern from the September quarter into the December quarter, your earnings have declined typically $0.12 to $0.14. Based on the guidance you put forth this morning, if I use the midpoint, it sounds like you're looking for a decline of $0.23 to $0.24. I heard you referenced some higher maintenance costs, and I suppose foreign exchange is not helping sequentially. Are there other factors at work that would be perhaps weighing on the December quarter?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Look, Kevin, the main reason that you come up with $0.24 is because we had an excellent fourth quarter.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I agree.","Seifollah Ghasemi","You know what I mean? If we had delivered $1.55 and then we said for next quarter, we do $1.50, then you would say it's only $0.05. So there's a little bit of an element of that, but we take very seriously when we talk about giving you guidance. And therefore, we didn't want to get ahead of our headlights for the first quarter. Can we do better? We'll -- obviously, we'll try to do that. But we just want to be cautious that we kind of deliver what we promise, and then so that we don't surprise people.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I understand. That makes sense. The second question, if I may, Seifi, on the strategic side. If you think about various possibilities such as potential to buy out some joint ventures, and I think you alluded to asset swaps or -- did you see any greater potential today, less potential or about the same, relative to your first day?","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, I see potential, but whether they are actionable, quite honestly, is a challenge. I'm not expecting any kind of a significant happening there, no.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Along the same lines here in terms of the fourth quarter strength and into the first quarter, and I think it was asked before, I'm not sure if it got answered. In terms of -- anything unusual in the fourth quarter in terms of year-end accrual, true-ups? Or anything unusual we should think about that could put that 17.6 in appropriate context?","Seifollah Ghasemi","David, our fourth quarter results are \"very clean.\" There wasn't any kind of a special thing that we moved forward or anything like that. That we feel we have the clean numbers. And if that implies that we are being conservative about the first quarter, maybe there is some element of truth in that. But I would like to have Scott comment on this a little bit more in detail.","M. Scott Crocco","Just I think, as mentioned earlier, when you look at it versus a year-on-year, I think that's the better reference, right? So in any time, any quarter, whether it's sale of equipment and different ins and outs and so forth and seasonality, there's going to be movement. But I think the best way to look at it is how did we do last year? How does that compare to what our guidance is for the first quarter? And again, focusing on the actions that we can control to continue to deliver cost reductions and productivity to the bottom line.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Seifollah Ghasemi","Well, thank you very much. And I would like to just, at this time, thank everybody who was on the call. We very much appreciate your very good questions. We look forward to getting a chance to talk to many of you over the next few months. And I would like to remind everybody that we are planning our 2015 Investor Conference. It will be held in New York and it will be late March or early April as soon as we have finalized the venue for that. We will share more details as we go forward, and we always look forward to seeing all of you. And again, thanks for the very good questions. We appreciate them.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."]}}
